    "and the Followers. And amid all the splendours of the\n",
    "World, its vast halls and spaces, and its wheeling fires, Ilu´vatar\n",
    "chose a place for their habitation in the Deeps of Time\n",
    "and in the midst of the innumerable stars. And this habitation\n",
    "might seem a little thing to those who consider only the\n",
    "majesty of the Ainur, and not their terrible sharpness; as who\n",
    "should take the whole field of Arda for the foundation of a\n",
    "pillar and so raise it until the cone of its summit were more\n",
    "bitter than a needle; or who consider only the immeasurable\n",
    "vastness of the World, which still the Ainur are shaping, and\n",
    "not the minute precision to which they shape all things\n",
    "therein. But when the Ainur had beheld this habitation in a\n",
    "vision and had seen the Children of Ilu´vatar arise therein,\n",
    "then many of the most mighty among them bent all their\n",
    "thought and their desire towards that place. And of these\n",
    "Melkor was the chief, even as he was in the beginning the\n",
    "greatest of the Ainur who took part in the Music. And he\n",
    "feigned, even to himself at first, that he desired to go thither\n",
    "and order all things for the good of the Children of Ilu´vatar,\n",
    "controlling the turmoils of the heat and the cold that had\n",
    "come to pass through him. But he desired rather to subdue\n",
    "to his will both Elves and Men, envying the gifts with which\n",
    "Ilu´vatar promised to endow them; and he wished himself to\n",
    "have subjects and servants, and to be called Lord, and to be\n",
    "a master over other wills.\n",
    "But the other Ainur looked upon this habitation set within\n",
    "the vast spaces of the World, which the Elves call Arda,\n",
    "the Earth; and their hearts rejoiced in light, and their eyes\n",
    "beholding many colours were filled with gladness; but\n",
    "because of the roaring of the sea they felt a great unquiet.\n",
    "And they observed the winds and the air, and the matters of\n",
    "which Arda was made, of iron and stone and silver and gold\n",
    "and many substances: but of all these water they most greatly\n",
    "praised. And it is said by the Eldar that in water there lives\n",
    "yet the echo of the Music of the Ainur more than in any\n",
    "substance else that is in this Earth; and many of the Children\n",
    "of Ilu´vatar hearken still unsated to the voices of the Sea, and\n",
    "yet know not for what they listen.\n",
    "Now to water had that Ainu whom the Elves call Ulmo\n",
    "turned his thought, and of all most deeply was he instructed\n",
    "by Ilu´vatar in music. But of the airs and winds Manwe¨ most\n",
    "had pondered, who is the noblest of the Ainur. Of the fabric\n",
    "of Earth had Aule¨ thought, to whom Ilu´vatar had given skill\n",
    "and knowledge scare less than to Melkor; but the delight and\n",
    "pride of Aule¨ is in the deed of making, and in the thing made,\n",
    "and neither in possession nor in his own mastery; wherefore\n",
    "he gives and hoards not, and is free from care, passing ever\n",
    "on to some new work.\n",
    "And Ilu´vatar spoke to Ulmo, and said: ‘Seest thou not how\n",
    "here in this little realm in the Deeps of Time Melkor hath\n",
    "made war upon thy province? He hath bethought him of\n",
    "bitter cold immoderate, and yet hath not destroyed the beauty\n",
    "of thy fountains, nor of thy clear pools. Behold the snow,\n",
    "and the cunning work of frost! Melkor hath devised heats\n",
    "and fire without restraint, and hath not dried up thy desire\n",
    "nor utterly quelled the music of the sea. Behold rather the\n",
    "height and glory of the clouds, and the everchanging mists;\n",
    "and listen to the fall of rain upon the Earth! And in these\n",
    "clouds thou art drawn nearer to Manwe¨, thy friend, whom\n",
    "thou lovest.’\n",
    "Then Ulmo answered: ‘Truly, Water is become now fairer\n",
    "than my heart imagined, neither had my secret thought conceived\n",
    "the snowflake, nor in all my music was contained the\n",
    "falling of the rain. I will seek Manwe¨, that he and I may make\n",
    "melodies for ever to thy delight!’ And Manwe¨ and Ulmo have\n",
    "from the beginning been allied, and in all things have served\n",
    "most faithfully the purpose of Ilu´vatar.\n",
    "But even as Ulmo spoke, and while the Ainur were yet\n",
    "gazing upon this vision, it was taken away and hidden from\n",
    "their sight; and it seemed to them that in that moment they\n",
    "perceived a new thing, Darkness, which they had not known\n",
    "before except in thought. But they had become enamoured\n",
    "of the beauty of the vision and engrossed in the unfolding\n",
    "of the World which came there to being, and their minds\n",
    "were filled with it; for the history was incomplete and the\n",
    "circles of time not full-wrought when the vision was taken\n",
    "away. And some have said that the vision ceased ere the\n",
    "fulfilment of the Dominion of Men and the fading of the\n",
    "Firstborn; wherefore, though the Music is over all, the Valar\n",
    "have not seen as with sight the Later Ages or the ending of\n",
    "the World.\n",
    "Then there was unrest among the Ainur; but Ilu´vatar called\n",
    "to them, and said: ‘I know the desire of your minds that what\n",
    "ye have seen should verily be, not only in your thought, but\n",
    "even as ye yourselves are, and yet other. Therefore I say: Ea¨!\n",
    "Let these things Be! And I will send forth into the Void the\n",
    "Flame Imperishable, and it shall be at the heart of the World,\n",
    "and the World shall Be; and those of you that will may go\n",
    "down into it.’ And suddenly the Ainur saw afar off a light,\n",
    "as it were a cloud with a living heart of flame; and they knew\n",
    "that this was no vision only, but that Ilu´vatar had made a\n",
    "new thing: Ea¨, the World that Is.\"\"\".replace(\"\\n\", \" \")"
