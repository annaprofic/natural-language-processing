Support and Defend First edition coverAuthorMark GreaneyAudio read byScott BrickCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishGenre Thriller Spy fiction PublisherG.P. Putnam's SonsPublication dateJuly 22, 2014Media typePrint (Hardcover, Paperback), Audio, eBookPages512ISBN9780425279229 Support and Defend (stylized as Tom Clancy Support and Defend, Tom Clancy: Support and Defend, or Tom Clancy’s Support and Defend in the United Kingdom[1]) is a thriller novel, written by Mark Greaney and published on July 22, 2014. The book is a spinoff from the Tom Clancy universe and features FBI agent and The Campus operative Dominic “Dom” Caruso, who is President Jack Ryan’s nephew. It is the first novel in the franchise written after Clancy’s death during the previous year, as well as Greaney’s first solo contribution to the overall series. In the novel, Caruso must stop a seemingly rogue National Security Council (NSC) staffer who had run off with top secret documents and is being pursued by the Iranians and the Russians. It debuted at number three in the New York Times bestseller list.[2] Contents 1 Plot summary 2 Characters 3 Development 4 Reception 4.1 Commercial 4.2 Critical 5 References Plot summary[edit] Dominic “Dom” Caruso is in India, training with former Israeli commando Arik Yacoby on a six-week training program in Krav Maga. One night, the Yacoby family are attacked in a home invasion, which ends with one of the intruders detonating a suicide vest, killing the whole family and injuring Caruso. It was later revealed that the attack on Yacoby was the result of a recent data breach in the National Security Council (NSC), which staffer Ethan Ross inadvertently set into motion when he took top secret files and shared them with an international whistleblowing organization called the International Transparency Project (ITP). After the attack, the NSC schedules a lie detector test, which leads Ross to panic. He was then asked by ITP head Gianni Bertoli to scrape the government’s servers for classified data and store them in a flash drive as insurance in case the techniques for “beating the polygraph” does not work. Unbeknownst to them, the flash drive was provided by Iranian agent Mohammed Mobasheri, who had infiltrated ITP. Meanwhile, Caruso acquires help from David, a Mossad agent who was also investigating Yacoby’s death. When the lie detector test does not work, Ethan is forced to flee the country with the flash drive by offering classified intelligence to Venezuela in exchange for safe passage. He was then kept in a safe house in Panama; Caruso finds this out from David. His boss from The Campus, Gerry Hendley, sends director of transportation Adara Sherman to accompany him in surveilling the safehouse. However, the Russian government had taken interest in Ross through their connections in Venezuela, and try to snatch him. Caruso and Sherman dispatch the GRU forces, but Ross, Bertoli and Mobasheri escape. With David’s help, Caruso learns that Ross is on Geneva, Switzerland, the global headquarters of the ITP; he as well as FBI agents proceed there to apprehend the rogue staffer. Bertoli had arranged a press conference where Ross can go public about the top secret files that he had stolen from the NSC servers. However, the two become suspicious of Mobasheri’s true intentions. With the FBI agents approaching, he abducts Ross and Bertoli, intending to escape to Libya; the ITP leader is later killed. Caruso chases them to a chalet in the Alps. Caruso sees Ross being tortured by Mobasheri for the password to the data scrape. Outnumbered, he decides to kill him using a sniper rifle; the Iranian and his henchmen later flee the scene with the flash drive. Caruso manages to contact the local CIA deputy station chief in order to dispatch an infantry platoon training nearby to block Mobasheri’s escape. Caruso then apprehends Mobasheri and secures the data scrape.

Thompson Webb, later signed agreements with publishing company G.P. Putnam's Sons continuing the Jack Ryan book franchise.[5] Greaney was chosen to write the first novel in the post-Clancy Ryanverse; Putnam spokeswoman Alexis Welby said that "Greaney's gift is that he's able to hit the trifecta of what makes a great Clancy book: Tom's terrific characters, really well-done action scenes and that over-the-horizon prescience about world events that characterized Tom's books."[6] Reception[edit] Commercial[edit] Support and Defend debuted at number three on the Hardcover Fiction category of the New York Times bestseller list, as well as number five on the Combined Print & E-Book Fiction category of the same list, for the week of August 10, 2014.[7] In addition, it debuted at number six on the USA Today Best Selling Books list for the week of July 31, 2014.[8] Less than a year later, the paperback edition of the book peaked at number five on the Paperback Fiction category of the New York Times bestseller list.[9] Critical[edit] The book received generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly noted that "Clancy readers will hardly notice that Tom is no longer with us."[10] Kirkus Reviews praised the book as "another timely, techno-geeky thriller" and added that "It’s by-the-numbers stuff, with the requisite villainy, continent-hopping, décolletage, neat tools and cliffhangers. But, of course, that’s just what Clancy’s fans read him for, and Greaney carries on that entertaining tradition seamlessly."[11] References[edit] ^ "Tom Clancy's Support and Defend". Amazon.co.uk.

The 1956–57 network television schedule continued the trend of the previous season, with two of the three major U.S. television networks (ABC and CBS) scheduling more and more westerns and adventure series during prime time. In addition to its current stable of Westerns, which included Cheyenne, The Lone Ranger, and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, ABC scheduled two new Western TV series: Broken Arrow and The Adventures of Jim Bowie, while CBS added Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater to its line-up, which already included Gunsmoke and Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Castleman and Podrazik (1984) called the rush to schedule Western series on network television during this era "a virtual stampede".[1] CBS "inherited Sunday afternoon NFL contests from the defunct DuMont network in the fall of 1956". Accordingly, "the expansion into Sunday sports by CBS (and NBC) meant that the traditional afternoon 'egghead' slots for highbrow programming had to be broken up, pushing those shows into the few odd spots still open in the day, or eliminating them completely. This reflected the networks' shift in emphasis during the mid-1950s, slanting television much more toward broad-based popular entertainment. Increasingly, this meant television programming produced in Hollywood [...] In 1957, the amount of prime time programming originating on the West Coast jumped from 40% to 71%."[1] NBC, behind CBS in the network Nielsen ratings, hired Robert Kintner to revamp NBC's schedule. According to Castleman and Podrazik (1982), NBC's plan was to launch a program which would compete directly with CBS's second most popular series, The Ed Sullivan Show, on Sunday, the most heavily viewed TV night: "Sullivan's show was popular enough to boost the ratings of the programs on both before and after his; as a result, CBS had a chain of hits to begin the evening." NBC's strategy was designed to weaken CBS's Sunday night line-up. NBC's new program, The Steve Allen Show, debuted in the summer to get a head start on the competition.[2] Although the two programs enjoyed a fierce rivalry, Sullivan's program would remain wildly popular, finishing second among all TV programs in the ratings that year, while Allen's show missed the top 30.[3] Beginning this season, NBC had at least one show in color for every day of the week. New fall series are highlighted in bold, while shows ending their runs are highlighted in italics. Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.[4] Yellow indicates the programs in the top 10 for the season.

The music, a mix of jazz and rock, drew inspiration from the "Canterbury" bands, particularly Egg. After a period of playing drums with other musicians around Kingston upon Thames, he moved to North Yorkshire and lived there for the whole of 1978. He returned to London in 1979, following an invitation to join Tim and Jim Smith in Cardiac Arrest (replacing Peter Tagg on drums). Other members of the band at this time were Colvin Mayers (keyboards), (later to play with Adrian Borland in The Sound), and Mick Pugh (vocals). The Cardiac Arrest album The Obvious Identity was recorded at this time. Subsequently, he and Tim Smith recorded the band - now renamed Cardiacs[1] - for a number of sessions in a small Surbiton studio. The results became the first Cardiacs album, Toy World. Following a short period in 1982 in which he was Cardiacs' keyboard player and percussionist, he left the band, moved to Birmingham and briefly worked with two of the remaining members of the Birmingham band Dangerous Girls, following their split. The line-up, calling itself TAAGA, produced one single, "Friend of Mine", working with UB40 producer by Bob Lamb. On returning to London, he worked for the remainder of the 1980s as crew member or live sound engineer, touring with several acts including Immaculate Fools, It's Immaterial, and Then Jerico. He was also Cardiacs front-of-house engineer at this time, and a member of the band Grown Ups with William D. Drake, Elaine Herman, Jon Bastable (The Trudy), Dominic Luckman and Craig Fortnam. Five tracks were recorded by this line-up but never released. From 1988, his work was based in and around Leeds, culminating in the building of a 48-track facility, That Studio Where he worked with This et al. producing demo material prior to the release of their Baby Machine album, and with the North Sea Radio Orchestra, mixing their first two albums. The studio was closed down in 2007. Today, his work is all studio-based, recording and mixing demos and masters in a new home facility in Leeds. Mixing credits include the Emmett Elvin albums "Bloody Marvels", "Assault On The Tyranny Of Reason" and "The End of Music", and the Gong album, Rejoice! I'm Dead!" working alongside Dave Sturt. His mastering credits in addition to the North Sea Radio Orchestra and Emmett Elvin albums, William D. Drake's second album, Briny Hooves,[2] as well as releases by Local Girls, the post-Oceansize project British Theatre, Charlie Cawood, Knifeworld, and Khyam Allami's debut Resonance/Dissonance, the latter nominated for the 2012 Songlines music award. He contributed a track and compiled and mastered Leader Of The Starry Skies: A Tribute To Tim Smith, Songbook 1, an album produced to gain funds for Tim Smith and his ongoing care, and raise awareness of his work. His first solo project Redbus Noface album #1 If It Fights The Hammer It will Fight The Knife was released on Believer's Roast in 2011. He compiled and mastered the Believers Roast Exquisite Corpse Game, a collection of contiguous fragments by various artists each of whom has only heard the closing 20 seconds of the previous section. J. G. Thirlwell, Bob Drake, Weasel Walter, Max Tundra and Katherine Blake were among the contributors.

The Central Division (Fiji Hindi: सेंट्रल डिवीजन) of Fiji is one of Fiji's four divisions. It consists of five provinces - Naitasiri, Namosi, Rewa, Serua and Tailevu. The capital of the division is Suva, which is also the capital of Fiji. The division includes the eastern part of the largest island in Fiji, Viti Levu, with a few outlying islands, including Beqa. It has a land border with the Western Division on Viti Levu, and sea borders with the Northern Division and Eastern Division. The Central Division includes most of the Kubuna Confederacy and part of the Burebasaga Confederacy, two of the three hierarchies to which Fiji's chiefs all belong. The nonconformity between the boundaries of the divisions and confederacies does not affect administration, as their functions are different. vtePolitical divisions of FijiDivisions Central Eastern Northern Western Provinces Ba Bua Cakaudrove Kadavu Lau Lomaiviti Macuata Nadroga Navosa Naitasiri Namosi Ra Rewa Serua Tailevu Dependency Rotuma Cities Lautoka Suva Towns Ba Labasa Lami Levuka Nadi Nasinu Nausori Savusavu Sigatoka Tavua Coordinates: 18°00′S 178°20′E﻿ / ﻿18.000°S 178.333°E﻿ / -18.000; 178.333 This article about a geographical location in Fiji is a stub.

The region has an area of about 9,200 km2 (3,600 sq mi). It is part of the wider historical region of Epirus, which overlaps modern Albania and Greece but lies mostly within Greek territory. Contents 1 Geography and ecology 2 Administration 3 Cities 4 Economy 5 Demographics 6 See also 7 Gallery 8 References 9 External links Geography and ecology[edit] Lake Pamvotis with the Ioannina Island Vikos–Aoös National Park Greek Epirus, like the region as a whole, is rugged and mountainous. It comprises the land of the ancient Molossians and Thesprotians[4] and a small part of the land of the Chaonians the greater part being in Southern Albania. It is largely made up of mountainous ridges, part of the Dinaric Alps. The region's highest spot is on Mount Smolikas, at an altitude of 2.637 metres above sea level. In the east, the Pindus Mountains that form the spine of mainland Greece separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly. Most of Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus. The winds from the Ionian Sea offer the region more rainfall than any other part of Greece. The Vikos-Aoos and Pindus National Parks are situated in the Ioannina Prefecture of the region. Both areas have a wide range of fauna and flora. The climate of Epirus is mainly alpine. The vegetation is made up mainly of coniferous species. The animal life is especially rich in this area and includes, among other species, bears, wolves, foxes, deer and lynxes. Administration[edit] The Epirus Region (Περιφέρεια Ηπείρου, Periféria Ipírou), as it is currently defined, was established in the 1987 administrative reform and was divided into prefectures (νομοί, nomí), which were further subdivided into municipalities (δήμοι, dhími).[3] Greece's local government reforms of 2011[5] streamlined local government by replacing the prefectures with regional units (περιφερειακή ενότητα, periferiakí enótita) and re-structuring former municipalities and communities to reduce their total number. Today, the four regional units of Epirus are: Thesprotia, Ioannina, Arta, and Preveza. The administrative division of the Epirus region in municipalities.

Sheep and goat pastoralism have always been an important activity in the region (Epirus provides more than 45% of meat to the Greek market) but there seems to be a decline in recent years. Tobacco is grown around Ioannina, and there is also some farming and fishing, but most of the area's food must be imported from more fertile regions of Greece. Epirus is home to a number of the country's most famous dairy products' brands, which produce feta cheese among others. Another important area of the local economy is tourism, especially eco-tourism. The natural environment of the area, as well as its traditional villages and lifestyle, have made Epirus a tourist attraction.[citation needed] The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 4.1 billion € in 2018, accounting for 2.2% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 14,700 € or 49% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 63% of the EU average. Epirus is the region in Greece with the third lowest GDP per capita and one of the poorest regions in the EU.[6] Demographics[edit] Around 350,000 people live in Epirus. According to the 2001 census, it has the lowest population of the 13 regions of Greece. This is partly due to the impact of repeated wars in the 20th century as well as mass emigration due to adverse economic conditions. The capital and largest city of the region is Ioannina, where nearly a third of the population lives. The great majority of the population are Greeks, including Aromanians and Arvanites. The delineation of the border between Greece and Albania in 1913 left some Albanian-populated villages on the Greek side of the border as well as Greek-populated villages and cities in Northern Epirus, in present-day Albania. In the past, the coastal region of Thesprotia was also home to a Cham Albanian minority, whose number did not exceed 25,000 in 1940s, alongside the local Greeks.[7] After the war and their expulsion, the Greek census of 1951 counted a total of 127 Muslim Albanian Chams in Epirus, while in 1986 44 were counted in Thesprotia.[8] See also[edit] Epirotic cuisine Northern Epirus Gallery[edit] The ancient theatre in Dodona Pindus mountains Acheron river Ambracian Gulf of Preveza Metsovo Aristi village in Zagori, example of Epirotic architecture Parga References[edit] ^ "Demographic and social characteristics of the Resident Population of Greece according to the 2011 Population - Housing Census revision of 20/3/2014" (PDF).

Kuiper is now a farmer at Elgin, near Grabouw in the Western Cape. Domestic career[edit] Kuiper was a middle order batsman and medium paced bowler who began with Western Province B in 1977 before graduating to the Western Province A cricket team. He played for Western Province between 1978 and 1995, becoming captain in 1984. He then captained Boland between 1995 and 1998. He played for Derbyshire in the English County Championship in 1990. International career[edit] Kuiper played 5 unofficial "Tests" for the South African cricket team. He played the first in 1981 and also the last in 1990 both versus England. When South Africa was re-admitted to international cricket, Kuiper played in the first One Day International (ODI) series versus India in 1991, playing a pivotal role in South Africa's victory in the 3rd match, and also in the 1992 World Cup. Kuiper’s place in South African cricket history was assured when he was part of the teams which played the Proteas first post apartheid ODI and Test. Although South Africa lost their first ever ODI, their innings was boosted by an initially restrained, and then firework laden 43 from Kuiper.[1] Kuiper also played in South Africa's first Test since re-admittance versus West Indies at Barbados in 1992. That was Kuiper's only official Test as he was seen as a one-day specialist. In 1994 he struck 26 runs, including three successive sixes, from an over by Craig McDermott in a One Day International match versus Australia at Verwoerdburg (Centurion). Kuiper played One Day Internationals until 1996. Scoring 61 in his last innings versus England at Port Elizabeth. But he was not considered for the 1996 Cricket World Cup squad due to his age and fitness. During his career Kuiper was compared to Ian Botham due to his big hitting. He hit 117 off 67 balls (reaching his century in 48 balls) with eight sixes and eight fours against the rebel England team at Bloemfontein in 1990. It was described by fellow South African batsman Daryll Cullinan as the best one day hundred he had seen.[2] References[edit] ^ Brief profile of Adrian Kuiper ^ Natural Born Hitters - Daryll Cullian's website[permanent dead link] vteSouth Africa squad – 1992 Cricket World Cup semi-finalists 1 Wessels (c) 2 Bosch 3 Cronje 4 Donald 5 Henry 6 Hudson 7 Kirsten 8 Kuiper 9 McMillan 10 Pringle 11 Rhodes 12 Richardson (wk) 13 Rushmere 14 Snell Coach: Procter Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adrian_Kuiper&oldid=943350981" Civil Code Long title Royal Decree of 24 July 1889 Enacted24 July 1889 The Civil Code of Spain (Spanish: Código Civil), formally the Royal Decree of 24 July 1889 (Spanish: Real Decreto de 24 de julio de 1889) is the law that regulates the major aspects of Spanish civil law. It is one of the latest civil codes in continental Europe, due to the sociopolitical, religious and territorial tensions that dominated 19th-century Spain. It has been modified numerous times and remains in force to this day. Structure[edit] The structure of the Civil Code is heavily inspired by the French Civil Code of 1804. It is made up of 1976 articles. Preliminary Title. Of legal norms, their application and efficacy (articles 1 to 16). Book I. Of persons (articles 17 to 332). Book II. Of goods, of property and of their modifications (articles 333 to 608). Book III. Of the different ways of acquiring property (articles 609 to 1087). Book IV. Of obligations and contracts (articles 1088 to 1975). Article 1976 is a repeal provision. 13 transitional provisions. 4 additional provisions.

[4] Function[edit] Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are regulators of the intracellular concentration of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and thus play a key role in cellular processes. Nine mammalian isotypes have been identified, which are encoded by separate genes. Mammalian DGK isozymes contain a conserved catalytic (kinase) domain and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The protein encoded by this gene is a diacylglycerol kinase, beta isotype. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The latest release, Sencha Touch 2.4.2, was released in June 2015[1] and is designed to run on the following browsers and platforms: Android browser, Google Chrome for Android BlackBerry 10 Bada Mobile Browser Kindle Fire Browser Tizen Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 IE10 Mobile Safari There are no announced plans to support Firefox Mobile. Features[edit] MVC Architecture[edit] Sencha Touch follows the MVC pattern which separates the application data, the control code and view. This separation allows large scale applications to be flexible and easy to maintain. Widget components and customisable themes[edit] Sencha Touch has an inbuilt DOM manipulation interface which negates the dependency on other UI frameworks like jQuery. It includes a set of graphical user interface GUI-based controls (or components) for use within mobile web applications. These components are optimized for touch input. The components are:[2] Buttons with device specific themes and effects Form elements such as text fields for email Date picker and address Sliders, selectors, and combo-boxes A list component with momentum-scrolling and an index bar A minimal icon set Toolbars and menus Movable tabs, bottom toolbars A map component with support for multi-touch gestures such as pinch and zoom Carousels All the components can be themed according to the target device. This is done using Sass, a stylesheet language built over CSS. Some of the native-lookalike themes are Cupertino Classic (for iOS6.x and below), Cupertino (for iOS 7) and Mountain View (for Android).[3] Transitions, animations and adaptive UI[edit] Sencha Touch has eight in-built transition effects including slide over or under the current element, pop, flip, and cube. It supports common touch gestures built from touch events, which are Web standards but supported only by Android, iOS, and some touch enabled devices. These are tap, double tap, swipe, scroll, and pinch. Since Sencha touch is HTML5 based, the layouts it offers are extremely adaptive in nature. Charting[edit] Sencha Touch also supports charting components including pie charts, bar graphs, line series, etc. with explanatory legends. These components support interactivity like pinch and zoom. Just like the Grid components in ExtJS, Sencha Touch offers TouchGrid functionality.[4] Profiles[edit] Profiling in Sencha Touch allows you to create different profiles catering to different screen sizes. When the application is loaded, the framework determines the type of device, and its corresponding profile determines which components and functionality need to be swapped out, and the specific views and controllers that need to be invoked, saving the developer the task of creating a different application for each type of device.[5] Basic application directory structure[edit] Sencha Touch applications have a basic file and directory structure as follows:[2][6] Directory/File Description app The main directory that holds the app's models, views, controllers, stores and profiles app.js File that holds the application's overall settings. References to all models, views, controllers, stores and profiles can be found here. Once these references are loaded, the main app launch function is called. This function loads the first view and hence can be considered as the first point of the application index.html Main HTML file for the app. It may span many pages/screens for the mobile app resources Directory that holds all the images, CSS and any other external file that the app needs app.json App's configuration file packager.json File used to create native packages ext-touch.js This is Sencha's JavaScript library (ext-touchdebug.js recommended during development phase) ext-touch.css This is Sencha's CSS library Developer tools and plugins[edit] Sencha Touch provides IDE plugins for ease of development. Benefits of these plugins include code generation and auto-completion, code refactoring and ease of navigation to framework codebase and custom classes. Sencha Touch has plugins for popular IDEs like JetBrains, Visual Studio and Eclipse. There is a visual app builder, Sencha Architect, for building cross platform HTML5 apps. It provides addiction features like theming and command line integration.[7] Sample usage[edit] Sencha Touch makes it convenient to use a map in your application using the Ext.Map component.[8] The inclusion of "Google Maps API" JavaScript file is essential for the GoogleMaps API to work.[9]<!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head> <title>Touch Test</title> <!-- Sencha Touch CSS --> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sencha-touch/resources/css/sencha-touch-debug.css" /> <!-- Google Maps API --> <script type="text/javascript" src="//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true"></script> <!-- Sencha Touch JavaScript code --> <script type="text/javascript" src="sencha-touch/sencha-touch-debug.js"></script> <!-- Application script --> <script type="text/javascript"> Ext.setup( { onReady: function() { // create the root panel new Ext.Panel({ fullscreen: true, items: [ { xtype: "map" } ] }); } }); </script> </head> <body> </body> </html> Ext.setup() is the starting point to initialise the application, setting up the viewport and the event system.[10] Comparison to native applications[edit] Sencha Touch supports PhoneGap[11] and Apache Cordova APIs for Accelerometer, Camera, Compass, Geolocation, Capture,[12] InAppBrowser, Media, Notification, Splash Screen, Storage (SQLite), etc. which were previously accessible only to native applications. Sencha Touch leverages JavaScript to create most of the UI components and change CSS of DOM elements on the fly. With JavaScript Engines being more efficient and faster than before, web apps run almost as smooth as native apps.

In gay slang, a bathhouse may be called just "the baths", "the sauna" or "the tubs". In general, a gay bath is used for having sexual activity rather than only bathing.[1][2] Not all men who visit a gay bathhouse are considered gay. Bathhouses offering similar services for women are rare, but some men's bathhouses occasionally have a "lesbian" or "women only" night. Some houses, like Hawks PDX offer 'bisexual' nights, where anyone of either sex is welcome. Bathhouses vary considerably in size and amenities – from small establishments with 10 or 20 rooms and a handful of lockers to multi-story saunas with a variety of room styles or sizes and several steam baths, hot tubs, and sometimes swimming pools. Most have a steam room (or wet sauna), dry sauna, showers, lockers, and small private rooms. In some countries, bathhouses are "membership only" (for legal reasons); though membership is generally open to any adult who seeks it, usually after paying a small fee. Unlike brothels, customers pay only for the use of the facilities. Sexual activity, if it occurs, is not provided by staff of the establishment but is between customers, and no money is exchanged. Many gay bathhouses, for legal reasons, explicitly prohibit or discourage prostitution and ban known prostitutes.[3] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early records 1.2 Early gay bathhouses 1.3 Modern gay bathhouses 2 Bathhouses today 3 Layout and typical amenities 4 Etiquette 5 High-risk behavior 5.1 Sexually transmitted diseases 5.2 Drugs and alcohol 5.3 Prostitution 6 Legal issues 6.1 Canada 6.2 United States 6.3 China 6.4 Germany, Austria and Switzerland 7 Notable patrons 8 Celebrities and the Continental Baths 9 See also 10 Footnotes 11 References 12 External links History[edit] Albrecht Dürer, The Men's Bath, c. 1496-1497 Domenico Cresti, Bathers at San Niccolò, 1600 Records of men meeting for sex with other men in bathhouses date back to the 15th century. A tradition of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of homosexual activity in Greece.[4] In the West, gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, adult theaters, public lavatories (cottages or tearooms), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex among patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.[5] Early records[edit] 1492 Florence In Florence, Italy, in 1492 there was a purge against the "vice of sodomy". The places used for homosexual acts were taverns, baths, and casini (sheds or houses used for illicit sex and gambling). The Eight of Watch (the city's leading criminal court) issued several decrees associated with sodomy, and on April 11, 1492, it warned the managers of bathhouses to keep out "suspect boys" on penalty of a fine. In the short period from April 1492 to February 1494, it convicted 44 men for homosexual relations not involving violence or aggravating circumstances.[6] 1492 Granada After the conquest of the Muslim city Granada in 1492, Queen Isabel the Catholic closed the public baths to suppress the homosexual activity they facilitated.[7] 1876 Paris In France the first recorded police raid on a Parisian bathhouse was in 1876 in the Bains de Gymnase on the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière. Six men aged 14 to 22 were prosecuted for an "offence against public decency" and the manager and two employees for "facilitating pederasty".[8] 1903 New York In the United States on February 21, 1903, New York police conducted the first recorded raid on a gay bathhouse, the Ariston Hotel Baths. 26 men were arrested, and 12 brought to trial on sodomy charges; seven men received sentences ranging from four to 20 years in prison.[9] Early gay bathhouses[edit] In New York City, the Everard (nicknamed the Everhard)[10] was converted from a church to a bathhouse in 1888 and was patronized by gay men before the 1920s and by the 1930s had a reputation as the "classiest, safest, and best known of the baths".[11] It was damaged by fire on May 25, 1977, when nine men died and several others were seriously injured. The Everard closed in 1986.[12] Also popular in the 1910s were the Produce Exchange Baths and the Lafayette Baths (403–405 Lafayette Street, which from 1916 was managed by Ira & George Gershwin). American precisionist painter Charles Demuth used the Lafayette Baths as his favorite haunt. His 1918 homoerotic self-portrait set in a Turkish bath is likely to have been inspired by it.[11] The Penn Post Baths in a hotel basement (the Penn Post Hotel, 304 West 31st Street) was a popular gay location in the 1920s despite a seedy condition and the lack of private rooms.[11] The American composer Charles Griffes (1884–1920) wrote in his diaries about visits to the New York City bathhouses and the YMCA. His biography states: "So great was his need to be with boys, that though his home contained two pianos, he chose to practice at an instrument at the Y, and his favourite time was when the players were coming and going from their games."[13] When a friend with "little experience but great desire" confided his homosexual longings to Charles Griffes in 1916, Griffes took him to the Lafayette so that he could meet other gay men and explore his sexual interests in a supportive environment: the friend was "astounded and fascinated" by what he saw there. The baths also encouraged more advanced forms of sexual experimentation. Griffes himself had had his first encounter with a man interested in sadomasochism at the Lafayette two years earlier (he found the man "interesting" but the experience unappealing), and several men interviewed in the mid-1930s referred to experimenting in the baths and learning of new pleasures.[9]— George Chauncey, Gay New York 1995In London, the Savoy Turkish Baths at 92 Jermyn Street became a favorite spot (opening in 1910 and remaining open until September 1975).[14] The journalist A.J. Langguth wrote: "...[The baths at Jermyn Street] represented a twilight arena for elderly men who came to sweat poisons from their systems and youths who came to strike beguiling poses in Turkish towels... although they were closely overseen by attendants, they provided a discreet place to inspect a young man before offering a cup of tea at Lyons."[15] Regulars included Rock Hudson.[16][17] In the 1950s, the Bermondsey Turkish Baths were rated by Kenneth Williams as "quite fabulous" in his diaries.[17] Steambaths in the 1930s: The steambaths that had been well known to me were those of East Ham, Greenwich and Bermondsey. In the first two it was frequently possible to indulge in what the Spartacus Guide coyly describes as 'action', but behaviour at all times had to be reasonably cautious. In the Grange Road baths in Bermondsey, however, all restraint could immediately be discarded with the small towels provided to cover your nakedness."[18]— Anthony Aspinall, Gay Times Modern gay bathhouses[edit] Crew Club, in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. In the 1950s exclusively gay bathhouses began to open in the United States. Though subject to vice raids, these bathhouses were "oases of homosexual camaraderie"[5] and were, as they remain today, "places where it was safe to be gay",[5] whether or not patrons themselves identified as homosexual. The gay baths offered a much safer alternative to sex in other public places.[5] In the late 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhouses – now primarily gay-owned and operated – became fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, particularly those who had been rejected by their families due to their sexual orientation, had nowhere else to go. The American writer Truman Capote was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.[19] Another service offered by the baths was voter registration. In the run-up to the 1980 election, the New St. Mark's Baths in New York City, with the assistance of the League of Women Voters, conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.[5] Deutsche Eiche, Munich, 2008 In Australia, the first gay steam bath was opened in Sydney in 1967. This was the Bondi Junction Steam Baths at 109 Oxford Street.[20][21] From 1972 through 1977 the following gay steam baths opened: Ken's Karate Klub[22] (nicknamed "KKK"), now called Ken's at Kensington; No. 253; King Steam; Silhouette American Health Centre; Colt 107 Recreation Centre; Barefoot Boy; and Roman Bath (nicknamed "Roman Ruins").[23] In Melbourne the first gay bathhouse was Steamworks in La Trobe Street, which opened in 1979 and closed 13 October 2008. Gay saunas, as they are more commonly known in Australia and New Zealand, were present in most large cities in those countries by the late 1980s. As homosexuality was legalised in New Zealand and most Australian states during the 1970s and 1980s, there was no criminal conduct occurring on the premises of such "sex on site venues".[citation needed] In Britain gay saunas were routinely raided by police up until the end of the 1980s; for example, raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham resulted in the establishment's owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine,[24][25] and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester).[26][27] By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Bathhouses today[edit] Sailors leaflet in 1998 Gay bathhouses today continue to fill a similar function as they did historically. The community aspect has lessened in some territories, particularly those where gay men increasingly tend to come out. Some men still use bathhouses as a convenient, safe place to meet other men for sex.[28] In areas where homosexuality is more accepted, safety may no longer be a primary attraction. Many bathhouses are open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. There is typically a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry to those who are visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution. Sexual encounters at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some feel that the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not.[29] Bathhouses are still used by men who have sex with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships. In many bathhouses the customer has a choice between renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), some or all of the rooms are freely available to all patrons. Some bathhouses have areas designed to facilitate impersonal sex. These areas – rooms or hallways – are illuminated only by a (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms. Some men use the baths as a cheaper alternative to hotels,[30] despite the limitations of being potentially crowded public venues with only rudimentary rooms and limited or non-existent pass out privileges. Entrance to Babylonia sauna in Prague, 2006These guys will actually call me at home or send me e-mails and we will make a date and we will meet at the baths purely because the sling is there and it's easier and we go for a beer afterwards. I use the bathhouse more as an ancient Greek, Roman social centre and also a fucking centre and a fisting centre as well, and there's a lounge where I can sit and relax with a coffee and a cigarette.— "Peter", Haubrich et al. (2004) Bathhouses are not always identifiable as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood. In many countries, being identified in such a sauna was still viewed by the press as scandalous. In Ireland in November 1994, the Incognito sauna made mainstream press as the gay sauna where a priest had died of a heart attack and two other priests were on hand to help out.[31] Scott Capurro is known for his deliberately provocative comedy material and often refers to gay sexual culture including gay bathhouses.[32] Layout and typical amenities[edit] On being buzzed in, the customer receives a towel (to wear, around the waist) and the key for his room or locker. The customer undresses, storing his clothing in the locker provided, and is then free to wander throughout the public areas of the bathhouse, which typically include the amenities of a traditional bathhouse or steambath (Picture from the movie Hamam). Many bathhouses also provide free condoms and lubricant.[30] Some establishments require a piece of identification or an item of value to be left with the front desk on entry. Homosexualities[33] emphasized the importance of a towel: Visiting a downtown gay bath was in many ways like revisiting a high-school gym – everyone wearing the same towel, in the same color, on the same part of the body. There was no status consciousness in the social-stratification sense; the towel or loincloth created a sort of equal-status social group.— a paragraph, Homosexualities, p239, 1979 Man wearing a towel ("Male Nude in Purple & Blue" by Lidbury) Bathhouses are often designed with imagery and/or music to create surroundings that are arousing to the visitors. Bathhouses are usually dimly lit and play music, although an outdoors, enclosed rooftop or pool area is not uncommon. They are often laid out in a manner that allows or encourages customers to wander throughout the establishment; a space laid out in this way is often referred to as a "maze".[34] Some bathhouses have a space where random, anonymous sex is all that can occur. These spaces – rooms, hallways, or mazes, sometimes with glory holes – have as their only illumination a (dim) red "Exit" sign, so one can have sex but one cannot see with whom. Other clubs, such as the Continental Baths or the Club Baths of Washington, D.C., would have two or more bunk beds placed near each other, in a public area, thus providing a place to have sex for those who can afford only to rent a locker, and also maximizing the chances of being watched, for the exhibitionists so inclined. Rooms are usually grouped together, as are lockers. Bathhouses are frequently decorated with posters of nude or semi-nude men, and sometimes explicit depictions of sex. It is not uncommon to see pornographic movies playing on wall-mounted televisions throughout the bathhouse. Most men typically just wear the towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, it is perfectly acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, is the first step in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.[35] Some bathhouses require customers to purchase yearly memberships and many offer special entry rates to members, students, military, or other groups.[34][36] In some countries, bathhouses can restrict entrance to men of certain age ranges (apart from the general requirement of being an adult) or physical types, although in other places this would be considered illegal discrimination. Some bathhouses hold occasional "leather", "underwear", or other theme nights. In the 1970s bathhouses began to install "fantasy environments" which recreated erotic situations that were illegal or dangerous:[5] Orgy rooms . . . encouraged group sex, while glory holes recreated (public) toilets, and mazes took the place of bushes and undergrowth (in public parks). Steam rooms and gyms were reminiscent of the cruisy YMCAs, while video rooms recreated the balconies and back rows of movie theaters. A popular Chicago bathhouse called Man‘s Country provided a full-size model of an Everlast truck where visitors could have sex in the cab or in the rear, which served as an orgy room . . . Man's Country also offered a . . . fake prison cell made of rubber bars.— Eddie Coronado, The history of gay bathhouses Many bathhouses sell food and drinks, cigarettes, pornography, sex toys, lubricants, and toiletries. Some bathhouses also provide non-sexual services such as massage and reflexology.[37][38] Etiquette[edit] Customers typically divide their time between the showers/saunas/jacuzzis and the main areas of the establishment. Customers who have rented rooms have free access to their room. Customers who have rooms may leave their room doors open to signal that they are available for sex. An open door can also be an invitation for others to watch or join in sexual activity that is already occurring. When a room is occupied only by a single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those who would like to be penetrated anally ("bottoms") will sometimes lie face down on the bed with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive fellatio might lie face up.[39] In the past, the baths served as community spaces for gay men. Even now, some men choose to go to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other).[40] While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity. But I’ve been to a sauna recently in New Zealand, where everyone just chatted away, which I found very strange. Um, but you know, that's because I guess it was a smaller city and people generally knew each other.— "S Alfred", The Social Construction of Sexual Practice, (Richters 2006, PhD Thesis) In this highly sexualized environment a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened areas of the establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A shake of the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.[41][42] I normally find people with groping don’t go away. You really have to as they grope your crotch area grab their hand and push it away and there have been times when I’ve had to do that three, two or three or four times before they actually get the message. There's also been times when I actually just had to say to them to fuck off.— "Richard", The Social Construction of Sexual Practice, (Richters 2006, PhD Thesis) Some establishments allow or encourage sex in specific group sex areas. In some jurisdictions such activity is prohibited, and sex must be confined to private rooms. Some forbid sex in pools for hygiene reasons. In the United Kingdom, the requirement is often set by the local authority's Environmental Health department.[citation needed] High-risk behavior[edit] Sexually transmitted diseases[edit] Pleasuredrome condoms From the mid-1980s onward there was lobbying against gay bathhouses blaming them for being a focus of infection encouraging the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), in particular HIV, and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions (see Legal issues, below).[43][44] In some countries, fears about the spread of STDs have prompted the closing of bathhouses – with their private rooms – in favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity takes place in the open, and can be observed by monitors whose job it is to enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.[34] Neither the claim that bathhouses are responsible for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, nor the claim that they are not, has been conclusively proved, but it is known that STDs are spread via unprotected sex, and as part of their membership agreement, or as a condition of entry, some bathhouses now require customers to affirm in writing that they will only practice safe sex on the premises, and venues frequently provide free condoms, latex gloves, and lubrication (and/or have them available for purchase).[34][45] In New Zealand and Australia, the New Zealand AIDS Foundation and constituent members of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations provide safe sex information for sex on site venue users. Some anti-bathhouse activists argue that these measures are not enough, especially given that it is virtually impossible to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sex – both of which put participants at risk for contracting STDs – in such situations.[46] Others counter these claims by pointing out that bathhouses are a major source of safer sex information – they provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises. In cities with larger gay populations, STD and HIV testing and counseling may be offered on-site for no charge.[47][48][49][50] Drugs and alcohol[edit] In some countries bathhouses are prohibited from selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license may be required to submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do not – or cannot – regulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people more likely to engage in unsafe sex.[51] Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises. The use of crystal meth is also known to lead to riskier sexual behaviour, but since gay crystal meth users tend to seek out other users to engage in sexual activity, they often prefer to make such arrangements via the internet.[52][53] Prostitution[edit] In some countries straight and gay bathhouses are used by rent boys to find customers by offering massage services, the "complete service" is often used as a euphemism for sex.[54] All interviewees were asked whether or not they used condoms, and all with the exception of Fabian, said they used them when having penetrative sex with clients. For fellatio, sometimes they used condoms and sometimes not ... For him (Fabian), it was all the same whether he used a condom or not. He also talked about the drugs he had taken, pure alcohol, crack cocaine, and ‘sometimes I inject, maybe 15 times I’ve injected, crystal, cocaine and sometimes heroin’. — Interviews with masajistas (masseurs) in a Mexico City gay bathhouse, Peter Aggleton, Men who Sell Sex, 1999 Legal issues[edit] Canada[edit] Toronto bathhouse raids of 1981 Main article: Operation Soap On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in Toronto, Ontario: the Club Baths, the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa, the Richmond Street Health Emporium, and The Barracks. The Richmond Health Emporium was so badly damaged in the raid that it never reopened. Nicknamed Operation Soap, the raid resulted in the arrests of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both the gay and lesbian community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.[55] Raid on Toronto Women's Bathhouse In 2000, Toronto police raided a women's night at a bathhouse called Club Toronto.[56] Police, almost all of them male, entered the establishment and walked around, taking the names and addresses of some 10 women and "aggressively questioned" volunteers.[57] A Pussy Palace organizer stated “[m]any women at the event were deeply angered and traumatized”.[57][58] A judge of the Ontario Court of Justice held that the police had violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by using male police officers in the raid, describing the police actions as analogous to a strip search.[59] Raid on Goliath's In December 2002, Calgary police raided Goliath's resulting in charges against 19 men. Fifteen men were arrested in the raid. Thirteen customers were charged as "found-ins" (found in a common bawdy house without a legal excuse) and two staff members were charged with the more serious offense of keeping a common bawdy house. The customers faced up to two years in prison. In addition, the owners of the bathhouse and a third staff member were later charged with keeping a common bawdy house.[60] On May 27, 2004, a judge ruled that the police had reasonable justification to raid Goliath's.[55] Defense lawyers countered that none of the anonymous information the police acted upon – for example that live sex shows were being staged and drugs sold on the premises – featured in the charges made against the seventeen men. They also pointed out that the police failed to call in the force's gay community liaison officer.[61] Goliath's reopened a little more than a month after the raid. In November 2004, the Crown stayed the found-in charge against the last remaining patron, saying it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case. The case against the owners and managers of Goliath's, however, was expected to come to trial in February 2005. Terry Haldane, the only "found-in" patron who was actively fighting the charge against him, accused the Crown of dropping the charge because Haldane and his lawyers had given notice of their plan to challenge the bawdy house law all the way to the Supreme Court.[62] In February 2005, all remaining charges in the case were dropped. The court cited a lack of community support and evidence (from a poll) that the community supported the existence of gay bathhouses by a small margin.[62] Raid on Hamilton's Warehouse Spa On August 3, 2004, Hamilton's Warehouse Spa and Bath was "inspected" by a task force of officers from the police, public health, the city's building and licensing department, the fire department, and the alcohol and gaming commission. Two men were arrested and charged with committing indecent acts.[63][64] United States[edit] In California the "Consenting Adult Sex Bill", passed in January 1976, made gay bathhouses and the sex that took place within them legal for the first time. During the 1970s, the two most popular gay bathhouses in San Francisco, both located in the SOMA neighborhood, were the Ritch Street Health Club at 330 Ritch St., the interior of which was designed like a Minoan palace, and The Barracks, a BDSM bathhouse at 72 Hallam near Folsom in which each room was designed to accommodate a different BDSM sexual fantasy. In 1978 a group of police officers raided the Liberty Baths in the Polk Gulch neighborhood of San Francisco and arrested three patrons for "lewd conduct in a public place", but the District Attorney's office soon dropped the charges against them.[5] In 1984, however, fear of AIDS caused the San Francisco Health department, with the support of some gay activists such as Randy Shilts, and against the opposition of other gay activists, to ask the courts to close gay bathhouses in the city. The court, under Judge Roy Wonder, instead issued a court order that limited sexual practices and disallowed renting of private rooms in bathhouses, so that sexual activity could be monitored, as a public health measure. Some of the bathhouses tried to live within the strict rules of this court order, but many of them felt they could not easily do business under the new rules and closed. Eventually, the few remaining actual bathhouses succumbed to either economic pressures or the continuing legal pressures of the city and finally closed. Several sex clubs, which were not officially bathhouses, continued to operate indefinitely and operate to this day, though following strict rules under the court order and city regulations. Bathhouses themselves, however, operate just outside the city, thus outside of their laws, such as in Berkeley and San Jose. In 1985, the New York City Health Department ordered that the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, heterosexual sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had to shut down as well because the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments would have been a violation of that ordinance.[65] Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Louisville, Seattle, Berkeley, San Jose, Cleveland, Portland, Reno, Las Vegas, Detroit, Indianapolis, Dallas, Houston, Denver, Miami and Fort Lauderdale are some American cities that have bathhouses in operation.[66] On October 8, 2010 ten patrons and one employee were arrested during a police raid at Club Dallas in Texas. The patrons were charged with either public lewdness or indecent exposure while the employee was charged with interfering with the police. The Dallas Police Department's liaison to the gay community stated that their actions were in response to a complaint.[67] China[edit] In March 2008 a series of police raids in gay bathhouses and at gay meeting spots in Beijing have resulted in arrests and bathhouse closures. This included raids on two branches of the Oasis bathhouses, known to be the most popular in Beijing.[68][69][70] In 2000, police arrested 37 men in a Guangzhou gay spa on charges of prostitution.[71] Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997.[72] Kaiserbruendl-Sauna in Central Bathhouse Vienna Kaiserbruendl: Pool for men (1889) Germany, Austria and Switzerland[edit] The German-speaking countries have a lot of gay bathhouses ("schwule Saunas") since homosexuality had been legalized in 1969 (and later). The oldest ones are the Deutsche Eiche (German Oak) in Munich, the Vulcan-Sauna in Hanover and Kaiserbründl in Vienna. Notable patrons[edit] Truman Capote Gay author Truman Capote (1924–1984) wrote about his visits to the Everard Baths.[73] Andrew Cunanan Andrew Cunanan's membership card to the West Side Club NYC was recovered in Miami Beach close to where he killed designer Gianni Versace. It is not known if Cunanan visited the bathhouse during his murder spree or at some other time. Other receipts indicated he had visited New York in early May 1997 between the murder of Chicago developer Lee Miglin and Finn's Point National Cemetery caretaker William Reese.[74] Justin Fashanu The first openly gay British footballer Justin Fashanu (1961–1998) spent his last night in Chariots Roman Spa. His suicide was due to press reports that the US authorities were planning to extradite him and charge him with sexual assault (there was in fact no warrant). His suicide note claimed that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that the youth contacted police only after Fashanu refused to pay him blackmail.[75] Michel Foucault The influential 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault (1926–1984) visited bathhouses in California in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the Mineshaft in New York. He died of AIDS-related causes in 1984.[76] Jack Fritscher Gay erotic author and editor Jack Fritscher (1939–) made hundreds of visits to the Mineshaft (a bathhouse without the bath).[77] Charles Griffes Gay composer Charles Griffes (1884–1920) wrote of his bathhouse visits.[citation needed] Mikhail Kuzmin Russian poet, novelist and composer Mikhail Kuzmin (1872–1936) is known to have patronized bathhouses. Some of the bathhouses in St. Petersburg at the time became known as friendly to gay men and provided "attendants", who might provide sexual services for a fee. In his diary, Kuzmin writes of one bathhouse visit: "the evening I had the urge to go to a bathhouse simply to be stylish, for the fun of it, for cleanliness."[78] Freddie Mercury Queen frontman Freddie Mercury was known to frequent the bathhouses of New York City when he lived there for a couple of years in the early 1980s.[citation needed] Harvey Milk The openly gay American politician Harvey Milk (1930–1978) vowed to stop visiting gay bathhouses when he ran for supervisor in 1975.[79] Rudolf Nureyev The Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev (1938–1993) was known to frequent the baths in New York. He did not get past the door of the Mineshaft.[19] Ned Rorem The composer Ned Rorem (1923–) wrote of his visits to the Everard Baths.[73] Gore Vidal Bisexual author Gore Vidal (1925–2012) is a documented patron of the Everard Baths.[73] Jeffrey Dahmer Serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer (1960–1994) often frequented bathhouses for victims in Milwaukee.[citation needed] Celebrities and the Continental Baths[edit] Main article: Continental Baths Singer Bette Midler is well known for getting her start at the famous Continental Baths in New York City in the early 1970s, where she earned the nickname Bathhouse Betty. It was there, accompanied by pianist Barry Manilow (who, like the bathhouse patrons, sometimes wore only a white towel[80]), that she created her stage persona "the Divine Miss M". On getting her start in bathhouses, Midler has remarked: Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days [when I got my start singing at the gay bathhouses]. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride.[81] See also[edit] LGBT portal Human sexuality portal Public bathing Public sex Hall–Carpenter Archives Homosocialization List of films featuring gay bathhouses Adult video arcade Sex club Caldron (sex club) Catacombs (sex club) Mineshaft (gay club) Footnotes[edit] ^ Prior, Jason (2007).

In 1974 they presented a two seated mid-engined sports car called OBC Mantorp (named after the Mantorp Park race track). The design was somewhat similar to the Lotus Elan, but with a more rounded front. It was powered by a BMW engine mated to a Porsche gearbox. Both the chassis and bodywork was in fibreglass. The company planned a production rate of five a day with 100 employees, but it never entered production.

According to Catholic Social Communications of Thailand, as of 2019[update] there are 388,468 Catholics in Thailand,[1][2] a figure that represents about 0.58% of the Thai population of 69 million. There are 11 dioceses with 526 parishes and 662 priests.[3][4] Contents 1 History 1.1 17th century 1.2 19th century 1.3 20th century 1.4 21st century 2 Administration 3 Congregations 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(November 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The first historical record of an attempt to introduce Christianity to Thailand is owed to John Peter Maffei who stated that about 1550 a French Franciscan named Bonferre, hearing of the great kingdom of the Peguans and the Siamese in the East, went on a Portuguese ship from Goa to Cosme (Peguan), where for three years he preached the Gospel, but without any converts. In 1552 Francis Xavier, writing from Sancian to his friend Diego Pereira, expressed his desire to go to Siam, but his death on 2 December 1552, prevented him. In 1553 several Portuguese ships landed in Siam, and at the request of the king three hundred Portuguese soldiers entered his service. The following year two Dominicans, Fathers Hieronymus of the Cross and Sebastian de Cantù, joined them as chaplains. In a short time, they established three parishes at Ayutthaya with about fifteen hundred converted Siamese. Both missionaries, however, were murdered by locals in 1569, and were replaced by Fathers Lopez Cardoso, John Madeira, Alphonsus Ximenes, Louis Fonseca (martyred in 1600), and John Maldonatus (d. 1598). 17th century[edit] In 1606 the Jesuit Balthasar de Sequeira, at the request of the Portuguese merchant Tristan Golayo, and in 1624 Father Julius Cesar Margico, came to Ayutthaya and gained the favour of the king. A subsequent persecution, however, stopped the propagation of the Christian faith and no missionaries were allowed until Siam was made a Vicariate Apostolic by Pope Alexander VII on 22 August 1662. Soon after, Msgr. Pierre de la Motte-Lambert, Vicar-Apostolic of Cochin China, arrived at Ayutthaya, accompanied by Fathers De Bourges and Deydier. In 1664 he was joined by Msgr. Pallu, Vicar Apostolic of Tong King. Siam, in those days a rendezvous of commercial enterprise in the East, gave shelter to several hundred Annamite and Japanese Christians who had been expelled or lived there as exiles due to persecutions at home. Some Portuguese and Spanish Jesuits, Franciscans, and Augustinians provided the spiritual care of their countrymen in Siam. Msgr. Pallu, on his return to Rome (1665), obtained a Brief from Pope Clement IX (4 July 1669), by which the Vicariate of Siam was entrusted to the newly founded Society of Foreign Missions of Paris. In 1673 Father Laneau was consecrated titular Bishop of Metellopolis and first Vicar Apostolic of Siam, and ever since Siam has been under the spiritual care of the Society of Foreign Missions. King Phra Narai gave the Catholic missionaries a hearty welcome, and made them a gift of land for a church, a mission-house, and a seminary (St. Joseph's colony). Through the influence of the Greek or Venetian, Constantine Phaulkon, prime minister to King Narai, the latter sent a diplomatic embassy to Louis XIV in 1684. The French king returned the compliment by sending M. de Chaumont, accompanied by some Jesuits under Fathers de Fontenay and Guy Tachard. On 10 December 1685, King Naraï signed a treaty at Louvo (Lopburi) with France, in which he permitted Catholic missionaries to preach the Gospel throughout Siam, exempted his Catholic subjects from work on Sunday, and appointed a special mandarin to settle disputes between Christians and others. However, after the departure of M. De Chaumont, a Siamese nobleman, Phra-phret-racha, instigated a revolution in which the Greek prime minister was murdered, King Naraï deposed, Msgr. Laneau and several missionaries were taken prisoners and ill-treated, and Siamese Christians were persecuted. When peace and order were restored in 1690, Bishop Laneau resumed work until his death in 1696. His successor, Bishop Louis of Cice (1700–1727), was able to continue it in peace. However, after his death the rest of the century is a history of persecutions (those of 1729, 1755, 1764 are the most notable), either by local nobles or Burmese invaders, though the kings remained more or less favourable to the missionaries and to Bishops Texier de Kerlay and de Lolière-Puycontat (1755). During the inroads of the Burmese, the Siamese king even appealed to Bishop Brigot for help against the common foe, who sacked and burned the Catholic stations and colleges and imprisoned both the bishop and the missionaries. In 1769 Father Corre resumed the missions in Siam and thus paved the way for the new vicar Apostolic, Msgr. Lebon (1772–80). However, a fresh persecution in 1775 forced him to leave the kingdom, and neither of his successors, Bishops Condé and Garnault, was able to accomplish much. During the Burmese wars, the Christians were reduced in number from 12,000 to 1000, and Bishop Florens was left in charge with only seven native priests. 19th century[edit] (left) Assumption College, first Catholic academy in Thailand, founded 1885(right) Saint Louis Hospital, first Catholic hospital in Thailand, founded 1898 It was only in 1826 and 1830 that a fresh supply of European missionaries arrived, among them Fathers Bouchot, Barbe, Bruguière, Vachal, Grandjean, Pallegoix, and Courvezy. In 1834 the last was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Siam, and the missions began to revive. Under him Siam numbered 6,590 Catholics and 11 European and seven native priests. His successor, Bishop Pallegoix (1840–1862), author of Description du royaume Thai ou Siam and Dictionnaire siamois-latin-français-anglais (30,000 words), was one of the most distinguished vicars Apostolic of Siam, the best Siamese scholar, and a missionary among the Laotines. He induced Napoleon III to renew the French alliance with Siam and to send an embassy under M. de Montigny to Siam in 1856. On 8 July 1856, King Mongkut signed a political-commercial treaty with France, by which the privileges granted to the Catholic missionaries by Phra-Naraï in the 17th century were renewed. The bishop was highly esteemed by the king, who personally assisted at his funeral and accepted from the missionaries as a token of friendship the bishop's ring. Thanks to the broad-mindedness of Kings Mongkut (1851–1868) and Chulalongkorn (1868–1910), the Catholic Church in Siam enjoyed peace under Pallegoix's successors, Bishops Dupont (1862–1872) and Vey (1875–1909). Owing to the complications between France and Siam, in 1894, the missionaries had to endure the ill will of local mandarins, though the minister of foreign affairs promised that no harm would be done to the missionaries and their work on account of the French invasion. 20th century[edit] Our Lady of Martyrs of Songkhon Basilica At the beginning of the 20th century, there were about 23,000 Catholic believers, 55 churches and chapels, representatives of such monastic orders, social and educational institutions (e.g., orphanages, schools and a seminary, college).[5] During the 20th century, many other Catholic congregations arrived to work in Thailand.[6] In 1975 the Catholic Office for Emergency Relief and Refugees was established for protection of moral values and social work, including the urgent problem created by refugees from Indochina.[6] Pope John Paul II became the first pope to visit Thailand, 10–11 May 1984.[7] The pope told King Rama IX Bhumibol Adulyadej that his visit was not only to return the courtesy when the king visited his predecessor Pope John XXIII in 1960 but to also personally thank Thailand for welcoming refugees which he said was an exemplary example of humanity. King Rama IX told the pope he observed how Christianity had grown in the kingdom and recognized how the relationship between Thailand and the Vatican first began hundreds of years earlier during the Ayutthaya Kingdom.[8] On 22 October 1989, the Martyrs of Thailand were beatified. The catechist Philip Siphong Onphitak and six companions had been killed in 1940 as suspected French spies at a time when Thailand was at war with the French. 21st century[edit] Pope Francis at Saint Louis Hospital, Bangkok during his visit to Thailand in 2019 In 2003, there were 278,000 Catholics in Thailand, which constituted 0.44% of the total population at the time.[4] Some members of the Catholic religious orders in Thailand (Religious of the Good Shepherd, Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres) take an active part in fight against human trafficking.[9] Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra visited the Vatican on 13 September 2013 where she met Pope Francis. Her visit was the first to the Holy See by a Thai governmental leader in over 50 years. At this meeting Yingluck formally invited Pope Francis to visit Thailand, although no dates were discussed at the time.[10] Pope Francis visited Thailand from 19–23 November 2019 as part of an Asian tour,[11] the first such papal visit since that of Pope John Paul II in 1984.[12] The papal visit marks the 350th anniversary of the establishment of the Apostolic Vicariate of Siam, which brought Catholicism to Thailand in 1669,[13] as well as the 50th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between Thailand and the Vatican.[14][15] While in Thailand he had audiences with the prime minister, King Vajiralongkorn, and the supreme Buddhist patriarch, as well as celebrating masses at the National Stadium and Assumption Cathedral.[3][16][17] Administration[edit] The church in Thailand is administered by 11 dioceses,[3] including two archdioceses.

A follow-up meeting of the organization's Charter Members was held on April 19, 2009 in Dubai,[2] leading to the Inaugural World Business Angels Association Global Conference in Beijing, China on December 5–6, 2009.[3] Membership[edit] WBAA is an NGO whose direct members are national federations,[4] which in turn represent business angel groups and networks in their respective countries. Neither business angel groups themselves, nor individual business angel investors, are members of WBAA, although they may be involved with the organization in other ways and participate actively in its programs. Countries whose national business angel federations are represented in the organization include Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, New Zealand, Panama, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union. Mission[edit] The primary mission of the WBAA is to raise global awareness of the importance and practice of business angel investment, stimulate the exchange of best practices in angel investing, and enhance the development of cross-border angel investing. It does this by promoting the professionalization of the angel market through the fostering of angel groups and associations; coordinating research produced on the angel market worldwide; standardizing terminology at an international level regarding angel investing; organizing in-person meetings and conferences for international angel investors; and developing online resources for information about, and access to, local, regional and cross-border angel investing resources.[5] See also[edit] Angel investor Notes[edit] ^ "Business Angels Leaders Forum agrees to create the World Business Angels Association" (PDF) (Press release).

Dudu (Sumerian: 𒁺𒁺, du-du), was a 22nd-century BCE king of the Akkadian Empire, who reigned for 21 years according to the Sumerian king list. He is depicted as becoming king during the time of relative anarchy that had followed the death of Shar-Kali-Sharri.[2] The king list mentions four other figures who had been competing for the throne during a three-year period after Sharkalisharri's death. There are no other surviving records referencing any of these competitors, but a few artifacts with inscriptions confirming Dudu's rule over a rump Akkadian state that may have included little more than the capital, Akkad itself.[3] His inscriptions present him simply as "King of Akkad": "Dudu the mighty, king of Agade: Amar-šuba the scribe (is) his servant."— Seal inscription of Amar-šuba.[4] He also seems to have campaigned against former Akkadian subjects to the south, including Girsu, Umma and Elam.[5] Dudu is said to have campaigned against Umma (vicinity of Girsu).[6] One inscription relates directly to his destruction of Girsu: "To {d}inanna Ištar, Dudu, king of Agade, when Girsu he smote, from the booty of Girsu he dedicated it."— Nippur fragment of Dudu.[7] Dudu may also have campaigned against Elam, but this depends on a dubious interpretation of one of his year names.[8][6] Unlike preceding Akkadian kings, there are no certain "year names" known from this time, thus it is unlikely that Dudu could have actually reigned so long. An alabaster vase in the Louvre Museum, since the year 2000,[9][10] has the following inscription:[11] Alabaster vase of Dudu of Akkad, Louvre Museum AO 31549.[12][13] 𒁺𒁺 𒁕𒈝 𒈗 𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠 𒀀𒈾 𒀭𒊊𒀕𒃲 𒀀𒉈𒀝𒆠 𒀀𒈬𒊒 du-du da-num lugal a-ga-de3{ki} a-na {d}ne3-iri11-gal a-pi5-ak{ki} a mu-ru "Dudu, the Great king of Akkad, for Nergal of Apiak has dedicated this"— Vase of Dudu, King of Akkad, circa 2170 BCE. Louvre Museum, AO 31549[14][15] The inroads of the Gutians seem to have caused a fairly rapid collapse of Akkadian power during this period of instability, and it has even been suggested that one of the four named rivals for the throne, Ilulu, was himself a Gutian ruler. After this period, it seems Agade became much less important.[6] Dudu was succeeded by his son Shu-turul per the king list, who became the last known king of the Akkadian Empire.

When he awakes he finds himself "married" to her - not legally - and stranded in Woop Woop, a desolate, dilapidated town hidden within a crater-like rock formation in Aboriginal territory. The residents are people who lived there at an asbestos mining camp before the land was handed over to the Aborigines; following a tragedy in 1979, Woop Woop was abandoned and literally "erased" from the Australian map. Not content with the deal given to them by the mining company (from Fremantle), they opted to return to their old lives in Woop Woop. At first they repopulated themselves incestuously, which caused wide mental instability. A rule was then enacted ("Rule #3") which bans residents from sleeping with their relatives. Since then, outsiders like Teddy have been occasionally kidnapped to keep Woop Woop populated. Their only export is dog food made from road-killed kangaroos. The town is run by Angie's father, Daddy-O (Rod Taylor), in an authoritarian manner that he disguises as communal (he and the other town elders keep the best luxuries for themselves in secret while doling out only the usual canned pineapple and sub-par tobacco to the others). The only entertainment available to the residents are old Rodgers & Hammerstein films and soundtracks, the latter of which they play constantly. These are presumably left over from the town's last official contact with the civilised world. After witnessing another kidnapping, 'Midget' the local hairdresser, is shot to death by Daddy-O during an attempted escape, Teddy soon realizes he will be trapped in Woop Woop for life unless he finds a way out for himself. Initially, he repairs his VW van which had been vandalized by the locals, only to have it vandalised again by Daddy-O. The Australian Cattle Dog that he adopts is shot as part of 'Dog Day.' He befriends a couple of locals, including the scruffy, affable Duffy, and Krystal, Angie's sister, who help him to confront Daddy-O's iron-fisted reign, and to arrange an escape plan. Duffy, reprimanded by Daddy-O for breaking 'Rule #3,' nonetheless elects to stay in Woop Woop, while Teddy, Krystal, and Krystal's pet cockatoo escape.

Letters between Burn and English Botanist Dawson Turner, are held by the American Philosophical Society. Jacob married Sarah Hone (eldest daughter of William Hone) at St Martin in the Fields Church, London in 1822. They had three sons, Robert, Henry and Allan. Their sons Robert and Allan emigrated to Melbourne, Australia in the early 1850s. Both sons settled in the Bairnsdale/Orbost/Newmerella region of Victoria. Yale University holds some of Jacob's works. His collection of papers of the actress Nell Gwyn is held by the University of Texas. Jacob was also a numismatist (a person who studies and collects coins). He wrote a book about coins/tokens used in London titled A Descriptive Catalogue of the London Traders, Tavern, and Coffee-House Tokens : Current in the Seventeenth Century - an original of which is held by Harvard University. Jacob wrote "Historical Collection Relative to Spring Gardens, Charing Cross and Vauxhall Gardens. To Her Royal Highness the Princess Augusta'' as well as ''Historical Collections Relative to Ranelagh Gardens. Jacob died in Kensington, London on 19 February 1869.[1] References[edit] ^ "Jacob Henry Burn, Deceased", The London Gazette, p. 159, 7 January 1870 2.

This allows the seal to accommodate a variable sealing gap. When pressure is applied internally to the seal, it inflates to conform to uneven surfaces and provides a reliable barrier from moisture, damp and other contaminants. Contents 1 How It Works 2 Applications 3 Materials Used 4 References How It Works[edit] An inflatable seal can be moulded into a concave, flat or convoluted configuration. Once an inflatable medium is placed between the seal and the force, the seal expands and rounds out to create a firm barrier between a mounting and striking surface. The inflatable seal is uniquely designed to return to its original state once the source of inflation has been removed. This lets the technician move both the seal and the other object freely. Applications[edit] Inflatable seals can be utilized in an array of industries like electrical, environmental and the military to assist in the following applications to: Squeeze to assist in the movement of materials Produce a mechanical holding force Stop equipment without damaging it Push objects with any degree of force Grip, hold, and lift objects while having the ability to retract the seal out of the way when deflated. Seal off one environment Different seal profiles will be used depending on the application. Common profiles include Castellated Profiles, Frog-leg Profiles, Footed Snap Profiles, Stem/Foot Profiles and Channel-fit Profiles.[1] The choice of profile depends on the speed with which the seal must be sealed and unsealed, the pressure it is expected to withstand, and the distance and shape of the sealing gap. Materials Used[edit] Many elastomers are combined to create an inflatable seal. Some of the more commonly used materials are: EPDM Silicone Viton The following fabrics can be used to reinforce the seal: Dacron Kevlar Nomex Nylon References[edit] ^ "Silicone Inflatable Seals - Inflatable Rubber Seals | Viking Extrusions". www.vikingextrusions.co.uk.

(October 18, 1740 – November 4, 1775), born Melcior Jaume Vallespir, was a Spanish-born Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Order. Born at the farm Son Baró in the village of Sant Joan, Majorca, his earliest schooling was acquired from the local parish priest. At the age of fifteen Melchor was enrolled at the convent school of San Bernardino, where Fray Junípero Serra had studied some years earlier. Melchor Jayme was admitted to the Franciscan Order on September 27, 1760 in the Convento de Santa Maria de los Angeles de Jesus. Following a year of strict seclusion and rigorous discipline, Jayme solemnly promised to observe the rule of the Friars Minor for the rest of his earthly lifespan; he was known as Fray Luis from thereon. The friar conducted his theological studies at the Convento de San Francisco (Palma de Mallorca), and was ordained to the priesthood on December 22, 1764. Fray Luis was appointed "Lector of Philosophy" upon completion of his coursework, a position he occupied at San Francisco from 1765 to 1770. Jayme arrived in New Spain in early 1770 after a long and arduous trans-Atlantic voyage. There he began the special training course at the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico wherein "soldiers of the Cross" were conditioned to the privation, fatigue, mortification and penance encountered on the missionary frontier. Fray Luis set out for California along with nine other priests to begin a ten-year commitment ministering to the indigenous population. An illustration depicts the killing of Father Luis Jayme by Kumeyaay warriors at Mission San Diego de Alcalá, November 4, 1775.[1] Jayme was assigned to Mission San Diego de Alcalá, where his earliest efforts were devoted to mastering the complexities of the local Kumeyaay language. Once he had gained a facility with its vocabulary, he was able to compile a polyglot Christian catechism. The lack of a dependable water supply, coupled with the proximity of the military personnel at the Presidio, led to the priest asking for and being granted permission to relocate the mission from its original site, atop Presidio Hill, to the valley several miles east, where it is now situated. Almost immediately there was a noticeable increase in the number of conversions which, by 1775, stood at 431. Some of the local Kumeyaay people resented the Spanish intrusion into their land.[2] At approximately 1:30 a.m., on the moonlit morning of November 4, 1775, more than 600 warriors from the surrounding rancherías silently crept into the mission compound. After plundering the chapel, they set the other buildings ablaze. The commotion soon awakened the two missionaries, the Spanish guards, and the Christian neophytes. Rather than run to the stock hold for shelter, Fray Luis walked toward the band of warriors, uttering the traditional Franciscan greeting: "Amar a Dios, hijos!"—"Love God, my children!" [3] The Kumeyaay seized him, stripped off his garments, shot some eighteen arrows into his torso, then smashed his face with clubs and stones. Jayme's body was, at first, interred in the Presidio chapel. When the new church at the mission was completed, the body was reinterred in the sanctuary. There it rested until November 12, 1813 when it was transferred once more. Today, the remains of Fray Luis Jayme lie in a common vault between the main and side altar. He is considered to be the first Catholic martyr in Alta California.[4] Notes[edit] ^ Engelhardt, p. 63 ^ Young, p. 12 ^ Engelhardt, p. 64 ^ Leffingwell, pp. 19, 132 References[edit] Engelhardt, Zephyrin, O.F.M.

He was a Reader in English at Durham University.[citation needed] The emphasis of his work in literary theory is opposition to postmodern decentering of the author. His response to Barthes' "Death of the Author" is titled Death and Return of the Author. He instead asserts authorial intent, even considering the issue of whether authors are personally responsible for unintended readings of their texts.[citation needed] Published works[edit] Burke, Seán (1995).

It supported her ninth studio album American Life, and visited North America and Europe.[1] Madonna was inspired to create the tour, after taking part in an art installation called X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS, directed by photographer Steven Klein. She incorporated the images from the installation in the tour, whose name was in reality a dig at Madonna's critics.[2][3][4] A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist.[5] The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal,[6] It received positive reviews from critics.[7] and was chronicled in the documentary titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret.[8] Originally called The Re-Invented Process, the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24–September 14, 2004, and was directed by Jonas Åkerlund.[9] Critical response towards the documentary was mixed, with one group of reviewers complimenting the live performances from the tour and the scenes involving her children and family, while others criticized the self-indulgent nature of the documentary and the preaching nature of Madonna's commentary in the film.[10][11] Madonna performing "Frozen" on the Re-Invention World Tour. A picture of the performance was used as cover-art. I'm Going to Tell You a Secret the album was released on June 20, 2006, in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film.[12] The album includes the original demo version of "I Love New York", a track later found on her 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor in a dance form. The track was originally recorded as a rock song before being re-recorded.[12] The documentary and the album was also released as digital download to the iTunes Store. Originally, Warner Bros. announced that the "American Life" director's cut music video would be included as an extra with the documentary, with the press release also including this information.[13] The music video was not included and no reason was given for the omission. The DVD was shot in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 on a single sided, double layered disc, with the image being enhanced for 16×9 televisions. The black-and-white visuals had mixed a lot of visual styles according to Jacobson, and had grains and erratic focus.[12] The non-concert color sequences followed the same style, but the performance sequences were in high definition. Backgrounds were dark and Jacobson noted that the color black appeared taut and full, while the few low-light bits came across well.[12] The 5.1 surround sound was mostly utilized during the live performance sequences. The live CD consisted of two pre-recorded tracks, "The Beast Within" and "Hollywood". There are 12 deleted scenes, spanning a total of 15 minutes and 38 seconds; scenes include Madonna on a bike, working with vocal coach Joan Leder, affinity for French and comical sequences featuring Price and musician Steve Sidelnyk.[12] The cover was a shot of Madonna from her performance of "Frozen" on the show, and the packaging included a 20-page booklet.[12][14] Critical reception[edit] Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[11]The Buffalo NewsPositive[15]Canoe.ca[16]Common Sense Media[17]DVD Movie GuideMixed[12]Jam![18]Pitchfork(3.3/10)[19]Rolling Stone[10] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that the reworking of Madonna's older hits like "Into the Groove" and "Holiday" gave them a campy, Eurotrash feel like the songs on Confessions on a Dance Floor; he added that "[the reworkings] help give the disc a cohesive feel even if the live performance, like the album it's hawking, is kind of humorless. That said, as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, and even if the excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done."[11] Sterdan from Jam! complimented the CD section of the release, saying that "Thankfully, the CD takes up the slack, delivering more than an hour of newer fare like 'American Life' and 'Music', peppered with oldies like 'Vogue', 'Holiday' and 'Like a Prayer'. Next time Madonna wants to share a secret, she should just leave the cameras at home."[18] Conversely, Sébastien Chicoine from Canoe.ca website preferred the DVD over the CD, saying that the disc was not "absolutely necessary" but could understand the business logic behind adding the CD to the release.[16] Barry Walters from Rolling Stone said that the live CD proved that Madonna is a better singer.[10] A reviewer from The Buffalo News was impressed with the release, saying that "This is exactly what you'd expect it to be – a live document of Madonna's most recent tour, which means, essentially, a tour through the dance-based pop music of the past 20 years."[15] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website explained that "though parts of I'm Going to Tell You a Secret frustrate, it remains a reasonably entertaining program. It probably will be most interesting for Madonna's most serious fans, though. Those in search of the broader titillation of Truth or Dare will leave disappointed."[12] He added that most of the shots in the DVD seemed accurate, time-and-again a softness crept up in the wide angle shots. Jacobson found the performance s shots to be compelling and gave the sound of the DVD a rating of B+.[12] The album was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 49th ceremony in the category Best Long Form Music Video.[20] Commercial performance[edit] In the United States, the release debuted at number 33 on the Billboard 200 with 25,000 copies sold in its first week.[21] It also debuted at number three on the Top Soundtracks chart, number 13 on the Top Internet Albums chart and debuted atop the Top Music Videos chart.[22][23] The next week, the album slipped down to number 107 on the Billboard 200, while holding atop the Top Music Videos chart.[24][25] According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 85,000 copies in the US as of August 2010.[26] In Canada, the album debuted and peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart.[27] The CD/DVD version of I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was eligible to chart on both albums and DVD charts. However, in some countries, both versions were combined and appeared on just one chart, as in Australia, where all versions counted towards the DVD chart and the release was ineligible for the albums chart. On the Australian DVD Chart, the album debuted at the top of the chart for the issue dated June 26, 2006, and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 15,000 copies of the release.[28][29] In the United Kingdom, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret debuted at number 18 on the UK Albums Chart, with first week sales of 14,449 copies. It was Madonna's 17th release to chart there, all previous releases having achieved top-five placement on the album chart.[30][31] The release was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 25,000 copies.[32] In France, the release entered the French Albums Chart at its peak position of number eight. After three months, it was certified gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for shipment of 75,000 copies of the album.[33][34] The CD+DVD also reached a peak of eight on the German Albums Chart and has been certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for more than 25,000 units shipped.[35] Across Europe the album reached the top-ten in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Portugal, and Switzerland.[36][37][38][39][40][41] On the Pan-European Top 100 Albums chart, it reached a peak of number five, and also reached the top of the charts in Italy and Mexico.[23] Track listing[edit] CDNo.TitleWriter(s)Length1."The Beast Within" Lenny Kravitz Ingrid Chavez Additional lyrics by Madonna 5:042."Vogue" Madonna Shep Pettibone 5:313."Nobody Knows Me" Madonna Mirwais Ahmadzaï 4:044."American Life" Madonna Ahmadzaï 5:215."Hollywood" (remix) Madonna Ahmadzaï 3:596."Die Another Day" Madonna Ahmadzaï 4:037."Lament" Andrew Lloyd Webber Tim Rice 2:278."Like a Prayer" Madonna Patrick Leonard 5:229."Mother and Father" Madonna Ahmadzaï 5:2110."Imagine" John Lennon 3:5111."Susan MacLeod"/"Into the Groove"Donald MacLeod / MadonnaStephen Bray7:1912."Music" Madonna Ahmadzaï 4:5413."Holiday" Curtis Hudson Lisa Stevens 5:4414."I Love New York" (demo version) Madonna 2:52 DVD: Main ProgramNo.TitleLength1."Intro"2:452."Los Angeles"19:123."New York"13:254."Chicago"7:285."Las Vegas"6:266."Miami"6:497."London"11:538."Dublin"8:329."Paris"9:4210."Lisbon"10:2011."Israel"15:0612."Credits"4:31Total length:126:19 DVD: Bonus FeaturesNo.TitleLength1."The Bike Ride"1:172."The Other Side"0:593."Steve/Stuart in L.A."1:414."Vocal Coach"1:175."Chaos"0:596."Birthday Party"2:017."French Trilogy"1:158."Steve/Stuart in Paris"1:199."Monte's Guitar Faces"2:1310."Fans Singing in Paris"0:4911."After Show"1:1812."Wailing Wall"0:35Total length:15:43 Formats[edit] CD/DVD – double disc digipak edition containing the live DVD and the live CD DVD – DVD keep case packed with the DVD and the live CD iTunes Digital download – The full 2-hour documentary in digital version Personnel[edit] Credits adapted from I'm Going to Tell You a Secret information from Allmusic.[42] Jonas Åkerlund – director, editing Mary Susan Applegate – audio production Susan Applegate – producer Angela Becker – audio production, producer Erik Broms – photography director Marcus Brown – keyboards Donna De Lory – background vocals Randy Ezratty – consultant Keeley Gould – producer Shelli Jury – audio production Shelli Jury – producer Frank Maddocks – creative director, package design Madonna – vocals, executive producer Mike McKnight – keyboard programming, keyboards Guy Oseary – photography Casey Phariss – recording technician Monte Pittman – guitar Bill Pohlad – executive producer Iggy Pop – main personnel Stuart Price – mixing Steve Sidelnyk – drums Joel Singer – engineer Nick Spanos – photography Charts[edit] Album charts[edit] Chart (2006) Peakposition Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)[43] 12 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)[36] 5 Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)[37] 10 Canadian Albums (Billboard)[44] 4 Czech Albums (ČNS IFPI)[45] 39 Danish Albums (Hitlisten)[38] 7 Dutch Albums (Album Top 100)[46] 4 Europe (European Top 100 Albums)[23] 5 French Albums (SNEP)[33] 8 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)[47] 8 Hungarian Albums (MAHASZ)[39] 9 Irish Albums (IRMA)[48] 40 Italian Albums (FIMI)[49] 1 Japanese Albums (Oricon)[50] 12 Mexican Albums (Top 100 Mexico)[51] 1 Polish Albums (ZPAV)[52] 34 Portuguese Albums (AFP)[40] 5 Scottish Albums (OCC)[53] 23 Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)[41] 7 UK Albums (OCC)[31] 18 US Billboard 200[54] 33 US Soundtrack Albums (Billboard)[55] 3 Video charts[edit] Chart (2006) Peakposition Australian Music DVD (ARIA)[28] 1 Czech Music DVD (ČNS IFPI)[56] 1 Dutch Music DVD (MegaCharts)[57] 2 Finnish Music DVD (Suomen virallinen lista)[58] 2 Hungarian Music DVD (MAHASZ)[59] 1 Italian Music DVD (FIMI)[60] 1 Norwegian Music DVD (VG-lista)[61] 1 Spanish Music DVD (PROMUSICAE)[62] 1 Swedish Music DVD (Sverigetopplistan)[63] 1 UK Music Videos (OCC)[64] 1 US Music Video Sales (Billboard)[65] 1 Certifications[edit] Region Certification Certified units/sales Album France (SNEP)[34] Gold 100,000* DVD Australia (ARIA)[29] Platinum 15,000^ Brazil (Pro-Música Brasil)[66] Gold 15,000* Germany (BVMI)[35] Gold 25,000^ United Kingdom (BPI)[32] Gold 25,000^ *sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alone See also[edit] List of number-one hits of 2006 (Italy) List of number-one albums of 2007 (Mexico) References[edit] ^ Timmerman 2007, p. 23 ^ Lieberman, Rhonda (May 1, 2003).

Released in July 2004, it was the group's third album. It is also the first full-length album release from the Against the Grain label.[1] The remix album was released almost a year later.[2] The album included breakbeat dance music, with tracks including the singles "Get a Life", "Push Up" and "Boom Blast". "Push Up" was particularly successful in Australia as a single, where it reached No. 2 in the charts, although in both Australia and the United Kingdom the album failed to make a major impact on the album charts. The tracks "Punks", "The Slammer" and "No Replica" were originally from the singles the Freestylers created as Raw As F**k in 2002–2003.[3] The three singles were their first ever productions in Against the Grain.[4] Despite the album's title, the album did not carry an "Parental Advisory – Explicit Content" warning due to a lack of substantial profanity on the tracks themselves.

They are a standalone, independent rugby club, running in partnership with the Bristol Bears (formerly Bristol Rugby) since becoming affiliated to them in 2008[1] and play their home matches at Cleve RFC in the Premier 15s.[2] History[edit] Bristol Ladies were founded as Clifton Ladies RFC in 1984 for what was intended as a one off match against Weston Hornets. They eventually made it into the Women's Premiership before being relegated. In 2002, they defeated Nottingham Medoc Casuals in the RFUW Rugby World National Cup Final at Franklin's Gardens in Northampton, Northamptonshire, which they won with thirteen international players in their side. They were the first club outside of the London clubs of Richmond Women, Saracens Women and Wasps Ladies to win the trophy.[3] In 2007, they were promoted back into the Women's Premiership and played one more season as Clifton RFC. In 2009, Clifton became affiliated to Bristol Rugby, who then took over the running of the team from Clifton RFC.[1] In 2012, they moved to Portway Rugby Development Centre from Dings Crusaders Rugby Football Club's ground that they were sharing with Dings Crusaders. This made them the first women's rugby club to own their own facilities.[4] Notable players[edit] At the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup three Bristol Ladies players captained their national teams. Sarah Hunter, Carys Phillips and Claire Molloy captained England, Wales and Ireland respectively.[5] England internationals Sophie Hemming Natasha Hunt Sarah Hunter Megan Jones Charlotte Male Harriet Millar-Mills Isabelle Noel-Smith Kimberley Oliver Marlie Packer Amber Reed Catherine Spencer Danielle Waterman [6] Amy Wilson-Hardy Kay Wilson Wales internationals Liza Burgess [7] Bethan Dainton Rebecca De Filippo Carys Phillips Elinor Snowsill Rachel Taylor Great Britain sevens internationals Natasha Hunt Amy Wilson-Hardy Ireland internationals Claire Molloy Larissa Muldoon Source:[5][8][2] References[edit] ^ a b "Clifton Ladies".

He was known for his flair and scoring ability, amassing totals of 414 matches and 110 goals in 14 professional seasons, nine of those spent in La Liga mainly with Real Oviedo. In 2006, he started working as a manager.[1] Contents 1 Playing career 1.1 Club 1.2 International 1.2.1 International goals 2 Coaching career 3 Managerial statistics 4 Honours 4.1 Player 5 References 6 External links Playing career[edit] Club[edit] Oli was born in Oviedo, Asturias. He started his career with hometown's Real Oviedo, making his La Liga debut on 10 January 1993 in a 0–0 home draw against Albacete Balompié[2] and being mainly associated with the reserves during his beginnings. From 1994 to 1997, with Oviedo still in the top flight, Oli scored 40 league goals in 106 matches, 20 of which in his final season to help his team narrowly avoid relegation.[3][4][5] Subsequently, he signed for fellow league side Real Betis, pairing up front with Alfonso and netting nine times in his first year in Andalusia. In the 1999–2000 campaign, Oli could only score once for the Verdiblancos,[6] who dropped down a level after finishing 18th. He returned to Oviedo in the off-season, going on to find the net regularly but also suffer two relegations in only three years. Oli joined Cádiz CF from Segunda División in 2003, contributing with ten goals from 40 appearances in his second year for a promotion and his first and only piece of silverware.[7] At the end of 2005–06, with the team having been sent to where they had come from, he retired from football at the age of 34. International[edit] Oli won two caps for Spain during the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, against Slovakia and Faroe Islands. He scored in the latter fixture, a 3–1 win in Gijón.[8] International goals[edit] # Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition 1. 11 October 1997 El Molinón, Gijón, Spain Faroe Islands 2–0 3–1 1998 World Cup qualification[8] Coaching career[edit] Moving into coaching in 2006, Oli started precisely with Cádiz, but was dismissed after only a few months in charge[9] as the team eventually failed to regain their top-flight status winning just four from 11 games with him.[10] In September 2007, he was hired at Segunda División B side UD Marbella.[11] In the following two seasons, Oli continued in Andalusia and the third level, successively with Écija Balompié and Betis B.[12] On 23 May 2017, after several years of inactivity, he was appointed at Tercera División club Marino de Luanco on a one-year contract.[13] In the summer of 2019, after achieving promotion to Segunda División B without conceding one single goal in the play-offs,[14] he agreed to a new deal.

The Kabompo Ferry on its lower course carries the main north-south gravel highway on the eastern side of the Zambezi. The river enters the Zambezi north of the town of Lukulu, at the north end of the Barotse Floodplain.[citation needed] Its main tributaries are the Western Lunga River which flows from the north, and the Dongwe River from the east.

The film was first shown on Hallmark Channel on May 30, 2009.[2][3][4] Contents 1 History 2 Plot 3 Cast 4 Reception 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The movie is based on the beginnings of the Safe Harbor Boys Home, a residential educational program for at risk teenaged boys on the Saint Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida, founded by Doug and Robbie Smith. The program teaches troubled teens the maritime skills of navigation and voyaging both under sail and under power, along with valuable vocational skills such as engine repair, electrical work and welding, combined with a strong academic program.[3] The program's combination of academic and vocational education, teamed with the structure, discipline and love they receive, has resulted in a 95% success rate with the boys served by the program.[3] The screenwriter Josef Anderson and executive producer Norton Wright spent hours interviewing the Smiths.[3] Plot[edit] Doug and Robbie Smith are a happily married, childless couple about to retire and spend their days cruising around the world on their sailboat. But before they have the chance to leave, their good friend, Judge David Roberts, asks them to care for two teenage boys he sentenced to juvenile hall. The facility is currently full and the judge tells the couple that, instead of being sent to county jail, the boys can help them prepare their boat for sailing day. The Smiths agree and soon take on two more boys with similar circumstances. The Smiths are soon faced with a variety of challenges from the boys, their surly attitude and a fire on the boat. Ultimately, Doug and Robbie see positive changes in the four young men, who are now reluctant to leave their new "family". Doug and Robbie also see changes in themselves as they rethink their sailing trip, their decision not to have children, and what their future now holds.[4] Cast[edit] Treat Williams as Doug Nancy Travis as Robbie Orson Bean as David Roberts Reiley McClendon as Luke Charlie McDermott as David Porter Cameron Monaghan as Larry Parker Sam Jones III as Billy Jimmy Ortega as Sheriff Reception[edit] Safe Harbor did moderately for Hallmark Channel at its premiere. The film was ranked among the top five for household and key demographics. It also ranked as the second highest-rated ad-supported cable movie of the day and fourth highest-rated of the week, delivering a 1.8 household rating with 1.5 million homes, over 2 million total viewers and 3.2 million unduplicated viewers.[5] Reviews were moderately positive. The New York Daily News called it an expected delivery of "decent people, solid values, [and] a general sense that there's more good than bad in the world." It also called it "heartwarming".[6] Laura Fries from Variety wrote Safe Harbor is exactly what it purports to be -- a haven of feel-good sentiments amid an onslaught of real-world bad news. A sound vehicle whose solid cast and based-on-real-life morality keep it afloat, this Hallmark Channel movie ultimately works, even if the characterizations don't always hold water. She also states that "obstacles and resistance are too easily overcome" and that there are deep characterizations of "good" and "bad" people, but that the talent of the cast makes it almost believable.[7] References[edit] ^ "Safe Harbor Movie on Hallmark Channel"[dead link], First Coast News- Press release Archived 2009-04-09 at the Wayback Machine, Hallmark Channel, March 31, 2009 ^ "Safe Harbor".

Sources: AFL Tables, AustralianFootball.com Michael Quinn (born 26 January 1990 in County Longford, Ireland) is a Gaelic footballer for the Killoe Young Emmets club and the Longford county team, and is also a former professional Australian rules footballer with Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). Quinn is notable as holding the record for the quickest conversion of a former GAA player to play in the AFL, taking the record from Martin Clarke and having made his AFL debut just weeks after arriving in Australia.[1][2] Contents 1 Early life 2 AFL career 2.1 Return to Ireland 3 References 4 External links Early life[edit] Quinn went to primary school in Scoil Mhuire, Newtownforbes. He grew up in Killoe, County longford. He plays Gaelic football with the Killoe Young Emmets, and made his Club Senior Championship debut in 2008, where he helped his club reach the Longford Senior Championship semi final. In addition he also played for the Longford minor team in the Leinster Minor Championship in the same year, reaching the Leinster semi final. In August 2008, Quinn arrived in Melbourne for a two-week trial with Essendon. After impressing talent scouts he returned to Ireland but was invited to return to Australia in November to be signed as an international rookie on 16 November.[3] AFL career[edit] Initially expected to be groomed through the Victorian Football League affiliate the Bendigo Bombers, Quinn showed prodigious progress with the oval ball, with a standout performance in an early intra-club match. After the match, Matthew Knights insisted on Quinn training with the senior side. His form saw him selected into the Essendon side for the 2009 NAB Cup in a match initially scheduled to be played in Darwin, Northern Territory but was moved to Melbourne to become a tribute match for the Black Saturday bushfires. Quinn's Australian host family had already made travel plans and took him to Darwin in the run up to his debut match. There he impressed enough with his pace, evasive skills and ability to earn possessions to be elevated to the senior list in place of injured Scott Gumbleton on 2 April[4] and selected in the senior side for round 2 of the premiership season. His debut was considered a standout for an Irish convert by football and media commentators, racking up 20 possessions, including 8 kicks, 12 handballs and 4 marks. Former Irish Australian rules footballer Jim Stynes described the debut as "phenomenal" and that he believed that Quinn will "hopefully have a long career" in the AFL.

The referendum was approved by 81% of voters. It specified that only a marriage between a man and a woman could be legally recognized in the state of Tennessee. This prohibited same-sex marriages within the state, reinforcing previously existing statutes to the same effect[1] until it was overturned by the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in June 2015. Contents 1 Introduction and approval 2 Text of the amendment 3 Results 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Introduction and approval[edit] In order for an amendment to the Tennessee State Constitution to be fully ratified, it must be approved by both houses of the Tennessee General Assembly for two successive legislative sessions. It is then put on the ballot as a referendum in the next gubernatorial election, where it must be approved by an absolute majority of those voting in the election. The amendment was first proposed in the Tennessee House of Representatives on March 17, 2004, as House Joint Resolution 990 (HJR 990), sponsored by TNGA Rep. Bill Dunn (R, Knoxville)[2] The House of Representatives approved HJR 990 on May 6, 2004, by a vote of eighty-five to five. The measure received Senate approval on May 19, 2004, by a vote of twenty-eight to one. After the 2004 election, the amendment was introduced in the Tennessee Senate as Senate Joint Resolution 31 (SJR 31). The Senate approved the measure on February 28, 2005, by a vote of twenty-nine to three, and the House of Representatives approved the measure on March 17, 2005, by a vote of eighty-eight to seven.[3] The amendment was then slated to be submitted to voters as a referendum during the 2006 gubernatorial election.[4] On April 21, 2005, a lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, the Tennessee Equality Project, and other plaintiffs, claiming that the amendment had not been published in a timely manner between legislative sessions as the state constitution required; specifically, that its newspaper publication had occurred only four months prior to the legislative election in November 2004 rather than the required six. This suit was dismissed at the appellate court level in March 2006 on the grounds that the legislature's intent to put the amendment before voters in November 2006 was widely reported in the media, meeting this requirement in spirit if not in letter. This decision was in turn appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The Tennessee Supreme Court rejected the ACLU's case in July 2006, stating that the plaintiffs did not show adequate standing to bring the lawsuit, thereby clearing the way for the amendment to appear on the November ballot.[4][5] Polls conducted prior to the election showed widespread support for the amendment. According to a Mason-Dixon poll released one month before the election, seventy-three percent of registered Tennessee voters supported the amendment, twenty percent opposed it, and seven percent were undecided.[6] Text of the amendment[edit] The amendment appeared on ballots as Constitutional Amendment #1. The text of the amendment states: The historical institution and legal contract solemnizing the relationship of one man and one woman shall be the only legally recognized marital contract in this state. Any policy or law or judicial interpretation, purporting to define marriage as anything other than the historical institution and legal contract between one man and one woman is contrary to the public policy of this state and shall be void and unenforceable in Tennessee. If another state or foreign jurisdiction issues a license for persons to marry and if such marriage is prohibited in this state by the provisions of this section, then the marriage shall be void and unenforceable in this state. Results[edit] The amendment passed by a large margin. Eighty-one percent of voters participating in the election, or almost thirty-one percent of eligible voters in the state, approved the amendment and nineteen percent of election participants opposed it.[7] Constitutional Amendment 1 Choice Votes % Yes 1,419,434 81.25 No 327,536 18.75 Total votes 1,746,970 100.00 Source: Tennessee Secretary of State – Tennessee 2006 election results All 95 counties of Tennessee voted for the amendment.[7] See also[edit] Same-sex marriage in the United States Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States by state Same-sex marriage in the United States public opinion List of U.S. state laws on same-sex unions Federal Marriage Amendment References[edit] ^ Howard, Kate (July 15, 2006).

Their catch was estimated to be worth 20 million TWD.[10] On 7 September 2012 and again on 9 April 2016, President Ma Ying-jeou visited Pengjia Islet.[4][11] Geography[edit] Pengjia Islet part of Zhongzheng, Keelung, Taiwan (ROC). The islet is located to the northeast of Keelung. The islet is surrounded by cliffs on its eastern, southern and northern sides. On the western side, the sea is full of reef and rocks. The only safe way to land on the island is via the dock on the western side.[6] Demographics[edit] There are no long-term residents on the islet. As of 2002, there were about 40 itinerant residents living on the island, who are mostly employees of the weather observatory and coast guard divisions.[6][12] The island had over 100 inhabitants in the 1890s, when George MacKay wrote From Far Formosa (see page 185).

It was recorded in Kingston, Jamaica, with some of the island's best reggae musicians as well as members of the I Threes, Bob Marley's backup chorus which includes Rita Marley. Further expanded by new mixes, dubs and Jamaican versions released in 2003 and 2015, the album is considered by many as being one of his masterpieces. The French edition of Rolling Stone magazine named this album the 50th greatest French rock album (out of 100).[1] The recording marked the first time a white singer had recorded a full reggae-influenced album in Jamaica, following previous single-song recordings from Paul Simon ("Mother and Child Reunion", 1972) and Peter Tosh and Mick Jagger ("(You Gotta Walk And) Don't Look Back", 1978). Contents 1 Reception 2 New Mixes 3 Serge Gainsbourg and the Revolutionaries 2015 triple CD book 4 Gainsbourg in Dub 2015 triple CD book 5 Track listing 6 Personnel 7 Charts 8 References 9 External links Reception[edit] With the exception of his 1969 international hit duet with Jane Birkin Je t'aime moi non plus (where Birkin's erotic voice had turned the song into a novelty success), Serge Gainsbourg was then only a cult figure[citation needed] having mainly met success through versions of his songs recorded by other artists including Brigitte Bardot, Juliette Gréco, Honor Blackman, Jane Birkin, France Gall, Petula Clark and others. The album sold over one million copies in 1979, turning him into a major sensation in France, Belgium and French-speaking Switzerland. Aux armes et cætera is one of the first appearances of reggae in French music, though Gainsbourg's own "Marilou Reggae" came earlier; it was included on his 1976 album, L'Homme à tête de chou, which had been recorded in London with non-reggae musicians. "Marilou Reggae" is also included in Aux armes et cætera, in a different arrangement with an extra verse, and renamed to "Marilou Reggae Dub". The title track is a reggae adaptation of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem. Soon after the song's first appearance on television on April 1, 1979 (a controversial appearance followed as the recording was perceived by some as an insult to the French Republic), it became a big success. Gainsbourg received death threats upon release of his cover of the French national anthem.[citation needed] One journalist, Michel Droit of Le Figaro criticized the song writing that Gainsbourg was feeding antisemitism by "trying to make money with the national anthem". Deeply hurt, in turn the singer published a striking reply. Other critics did not like that the original text was truncated, half of the chorus line (including the most military-oriented section of the song) being edited out. Some years later in 1981, Gainsbourg purchased the original manuscript of "La Marseillaise" at an auction, which was signed by the composer. He then showed critics that his version was, in fact, closer to the original than any other recorded version as the manuscript clearly shows the words "Aux armes et cætera..." for the chorus as author Rouget de l'Isle did not bother writing the full chorus each time, preferring to shorten it with the word etc..[2] Two other singles were taken from the album: Vieille canaille (a French version of You Rascal You written in the 1920s by Sam Theard) and Gainsbourg's own Lola Rastaquouère. A short European tour featuring the Jamaican group The Revolutionaries (see-line-up below) but not the I-Three followed in December 1979, culminating in a series of shows in Paris. At a show in Strasbourg, outraged paratroopers showed up in the concert hall and the show was cancelled. Serge Gainsbourg nevertheless came onstage on his own and courageously sang the regular national anthem, stating that he gave "La Marseillaise its original revolutionary meaning back". The soldiers then sang along with him in a military salute posture. The event was shown on TV news, causing more controversy and sarcasm - and boosting album sales. The Paris shows at Le Palais were recorded by Philippe Lerichomme, mixed by Bruno Blum and engineer Thierry Bertomeu and issued as a double CD, Gainsbourg et cætera in 2006. With the same musicians and backing vocalists, Serge Gainsbourg recorded a reggae follow-up studio album in 1981, Mauvaises nouvelles des étoiles. In 2003 that album was also given the "dub style" treatment (see "new mixes" below) by Bruno Blum and Soljie Hamilton. New Mixes[edit] In 2003, Aux Armes et Cætera was re-released in a Bruno Blum-produced deluxe double CD version including new "dub style" mixes of the vocal tracks, including some previously unreleased recordings. Disc 2 features dub versions of most tracks and Jamaican artists versions/adaptations of all songs. An English rendition of "Lola Rastaquouère" sung by producer Bruno Blum is also included on the album, as well as a newly recorded version of "Marilou Reggae" (using the "L'Homme à Tête de Chou" vocal) featuring drummer Leroy "Horsemouth" Wallace, bass player Flabba Holt and Blum on guitar. Jamaican versions include Lone Ranger, Big Youth, Buffalo Bill, Lisa Dainjah, King Stitt and Brady. All tracks were mixed by veteran Jamaican sound engineer Soljie Hamilton. Serge Gainsbourg's other two reggae albums were also newly mixed by producer Bruno Blum with engineers Soljie Hamilton and Thierry Bertomeu. Both Aux Armes et Cætera and Mauvaises Nouvelles des Étoiles were also released on vinyl in 2003 (two albums named Versions Serge), as well as their dubs (two albums named Versions Dub), and Jamaican vocalists versions (two albums named Versions DJ). In addition, a four-track 10" vinyl record featuring four mixes of the newly recorded version of "Marilou Reggae" was issued. Two limited edition vinyl singles were also pressed in Jamaica ("Aux Armes Et Cætera" plus a dub titled "version" that is not available anywhere else, as well as Big Youth's "Aux Armes!" plus dub. Serge Gainsbourg and the Revolutionaries 2015 triple CD book[edit] In June 2015, Aux armes et cætera as well as both other Serge Gainsbourg reggae albums (Mauvaises nouvelles des étoiles and a live album), all featuring The Revolutionaries with Sly & Robbie, were reissued by the Mercury label in a Bruno Blum-produced, triple CD, "Super DeLuxe", 10" book set. The book text was written by Bruno Blum and features original producer Philippe Lerichomme photographs. Called Serge Gainsbourg & the Revolutionaries, it includes several previously unreleased mixes and versions, such as Javanaise Remake with the 1964 original version-styled "sham-dam sham-dam" backing vocals added in 2002. Other previously unreleased versions include Brigade des Stups, as well as alternate vocal takes of Marilou Reggae Dub, Vieille Canaille (Sam Theard's You Rascal You) and an incomplete Lola Rastaquouère. Previously unreleased recordings from the other two albums are also included, making this set the definitive, complete Gainsbourg reggae sessions set. Gainsbourg in Dub 2015 triple CD book[edit] In June 2015, at the same time as Serge Gainsbourg & the Revolutionaries, 54 fine dubs (all but one were previously unreleased and cannot be found on the 2003 sets) were issued by the Mercury label in a Bruno Blum-produced, triple CD, "Super DeLuxe", 10" book set named Gainsbourg in Dub. All dubs were mixed in Jamaica by Blum and Jamaican dub master Soljie Hamilton, except for seventeen tracks taken from the live album, all of which were mixed by Blum and Marcadet Studio engineer Bryan Pachaud in France. The book text was written by Bruno Blum and features his photographs as well as original producer Philippe Lerichomme's. Nineteen of them are dub mixes of Aux armes et cætera songs. A dub named "Je ne dub plus, moi aussi" revealed the existence of an Aux armes et cætera album out take, but only snippets of Gainsbourg's vocals can be heard on it, as well as a chorus sung by Juliette Tourret. Named "Je ne t'aime plus, moi aussi", the full vocal version of this song has not yet surfaced. Apparently the song was refused by the Gainsbourg estate because of X-rated lyrics, creating a bit of an intrigue as unheard Gainsbourg musical creations are very much sought after by fans — furthermore when controversial. According to French journalist and Gainsbourg friend Gérard Bar-David (his wife was the singer's press agent for years), who recorded Gainsbourg's vocals months after the music track was recorded, the vocals were added to the music by Bruno Blum on the Sly & Robbie backing track because they fitted the unfinished song title like a glove. The vocals were actually taken from a Gainsbourg-directed video creation featuring an unrestrained Gainsbourg talking about women and filmed by Bar-David's team. The video has not surfaced either.[3] Track listing[edit] All tracks are written by Serge Gainsbourg, except where noted.Original editionNo.TitleWriter(s)Length1."Javanaise Remake" 3:052."Aux armes et cætera"Serge Gainsbourg, Rouget de l'Isle3:053."Les Locataires" 2:094."Des Laids Des Laids" 2:365."Brigade Des Stups" 1:576."Vieille Canaille"Sam Theard, Jacques Plante3:027."Lola Rastaquouère" 3:408."Relax Baby Be Cool" 2:309."Daisy Temple" 3:5310."Eau Et Gaz A Tous Les Etages" 0:3711."Pas Long Feu" 2:3312."Marilou Reggae Dub" 3:48 Personnel[edit] Credits adapted from liner notes.

It begins with a train that is heading for a crash into a stalled petrol tanker at a level crossing and then flashes back and tells four different stories about some of the passengers. Contents 1 Plot 2 Main cast 3 Production 4 Reception 5 References 6 External links Plot[edit] A Liverpool-bound train departs from Euston station in London in the period immediately after World War II. After dark, the train is travelling north at speed when a light being waved by the trackside is seen by the driver. He applies the brakes but a road tanker stalled across a level crossing is looming up just ahead. Plainly, there is not enough room to stop but, just as the collision is about to occur, there is a fade-out succeeded by a view of the locomotive sheds at Euston three days earlier. Personal stories of passengers are then told in flashbacks which make up the "train of events" of the title. The first story, "The Actor", is about Philip (Peter Finch) who has a dark secret. He has been visited by his estranged wife and we learn that she has been unfaithful while he was in the Army. She jeers at him and he is roused to revenge, strangling her while a gramophone plays These Foolish Things. The theatre party to which he belongs is on the train, en route to Canada. Also on board is a costume hamper containing the body of his wife. He is hoping to get rid of it on the transatlantic crossing but detectives have been tracking him and are on the train. The second story, "The Prisoner-of-War", is about Richard (Laurence Payne) and Ella (Joan Dowling). He is a prisoner of war (POW) on the run who doesn't wish to return to Germany. They have hitherto endured a miserable secret life in assorted seedy lodgings and Ella is hoping they can start again abroad. However, she has stolen money from her landlady to pay her fare and there is only enough for one of them to emigrate. Selflessly, she intends it be him. The third story, "The Composer", is about composer Raymond Hillary (John Clements) who is travelling to a performance with his star pianist, the temperamental Irina (Irina Baronova). Although married he has had a string of dalliances, Irina being the latest. The fourth story, "The Engine Driver", is centred on engine driver Jim Hardcastle (Jack Warner). He is facing his own crisis: he is a candidate for a management job at the locomotive sheds. Getting the job would take him off the footplate and allow him to work office hours, the heartfelt wish of his wife Emily (Gladys Henson). However, to cover for his daughter's future husband when he was accidentally absent, Jim has illicitly worked his shift and if this were to come to light it could cost him the promotion. The film returns to the train, roaring through the night. Again we see the light by the track and the tanker just ahead but this time also the collision. The derailed and damaged train lies in ruins. Jim Hardcastle groggily recovers consciousness in a pile of coal from the overturned tender, as shocked passengers wander about. One of them is Richard but his Ella is badly injured and on a stretcher; she dies before she can be taken away and Richard runs from the scene (and the attending police) unaware of the steamship ticket in Ella's handbag, which blows away. Philip seems unhurt and makes a dash for freedom, but as he tries to evade the detectives he runs dangerously close to the wreckage and an unstable coach collapses upon him. Irina and Raymond are only bruised and their company is able to continue, albeit in bandages. There is a happy ending for driver Jim. The final scene shows him waving goodbye to his wife as he prepares to cycle across to the locomotive sheds on the first day of his new job.

He had insisted on learning how a steam engine is driven to get his posture right, but fell into a locomotive turntable pit and injured his back. He had a slight limp ever afterwards as a result, which became noticeably worse as he aged. One quirk of the film is that the number of a locomotive featured in one of the early scenes is painted out (presumably to avoid worrying passengers who might fear that it really would be involved in an accident) but is still clearly readable because the numbers themselves were made from raised metal. The locomotives used in the film included two LMS Class 3F "Jinty" 0-6-0Ts Nos. 47327 and 47675, and LMS Royal Scot Class No. 46126 Royal Army Service Corps. Reception[edit] The film premiered on 18 August 1949 at the Gaumont Haymarket in London,[1] and the reviewer for The Times didn't appreciate the four-in-one storyline : "The contrivance at best is clumsy, and there are not any inherent virtues in "Train of Events" to compensate for the inevitable distraction and division of attention."[2] References[edit] ^ "Picture Theatres, Gaumont".

Brian Webber lives in a flat above a petrol station in London (in the last series he moved to Newcastle to attend university). He's trying hard to make his way in the world, thus far with limited success. His girlfriend, Sonia, is a very serious minded young woman who is passionate only about things like vegetarianism and ecology. When Brian's younger brother, Steve, arrives in London looking for somewhere to stay, his lazy, cynical, noisy "Northern lout" attitude disrupts Brian's already messy life. Like Only Fools and Horses, Sink or Swim was filmed in Bristol doubling for London. It ran for three series between 4 December 1980 and 14 October 1982 and was written by Alex Shearer, who later wrote the Nicholas Lyndhurst sitcom The Two of Us for LWT from 1986 to 1990. Production of the sitcom overlapped the first two years of Davison also starring as the Fifth Doctor in Doctor Who, which imposed constraints on the recording schedules.[1] Cast[edit] Peter Davison – Brian Webber Robert Glenister – Steve Webber Sara Corper – Sonia Amanda Orton – Sandra (series 1 & 2) Ron Pember – Mike Connor (series 1 & 2) Gillian Taylforth – Christine (series 2) Briony McRoberts – Charlotte (series 3) Russell Wootton – Douglas (series 3) References[edit] ^ Howe, David J.; Walker, Stephen James (1995).

The club is represented in the Danish Superliga and has won four Danish football Championships and three Danish Cup trophies. Most recently the team won the double in 2014. AaB was founded on 13 May 1885 by English engineers who were building Jutland's railway system, and the first years was concentrated on the game of cricket. It was initially named Aalborg Cricketklub (Aalborg Cricket club) but the name of the club was changed to Aalborg Boldklub (Aalborg ballclub) in 1899. Football was adopted on an amateur basis in 1902, and has since been the main sport, as the name was changed to the current Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885 (Aalborg ballgameclub of 1885) in 1906. In 1995 AaB became the first Danish team to participate in the UEFA Champions League group stage when they were awarded a place because Dynamo Kiev was expelled from the tournament after one game for attempted match-fixing. AaB qualified for the 2008–09 Champions League and is with two appearances the Danish club who has participated the second most in the tournament after F.C. Copenhagen.

It was initially named Aalborg Cricketklub (Aalborg Cricket club) but the name of the club was changed to Aalborg Boldklub (Aalborg ballclub) in 1899. Football was adopted on an amateur basis in 1902, and has since been the main sport, as the name was changed to the current Aalborg Boldspilklub af 1885 (Aalborg ballgameclub of 1885) in 1906. Aalborg BK was part of the top-flight Danish leagues from the 1928–29 season, until the relegation of the club in 1947. The club returned to the best league in 1963, and except from the years of 1972, 1978 and 1981–1986, Aalborg BK has since been a part of the various editions of the Danish football championship. Despite its many years in the Danish championship, the club never won a championship title, but Aalborg BK won the Danish Cup competition in 1966 and 1970. Paid football was introduced in Denmark by the Danish Football Association in 1978. As Aalborg BK returned to the best Danish league, the club founded the professional branch of AaB A/S in 1987 to run a professional football team.[4] Through the 1990s, the club won its first two Danish championships. In the Danish Superliga 1994-95 season, 24 goals from league topscorer Erik Bo Andersen secured the championship title for the team of coach Poul Erik Andreasen. The club was initially eliminated by Dynamo Kyiv in the qualification matches for the UEFA Champions League 1995-96, but following a bribing scandal Kyiv was banned from the tournament and Aalborg BK entered in their place. Aalborg BK thus became the first Danish team to compete in the UEFA Champions League. As they managed a 2–1 home win over Panathinaikos and a 2–2 draw with Porto in the six matches the club played in the initial group stage, Aalborg BK was eliminated. Erik Bo Andersen left the club for Scottish club Rangers, but in Søren Frederiksen, the club found its next goal-getter. Though not the league top scorer, Frederiksen scored 17 goals in the Danish Superliga 1998-99 which the club won under guidance of Swedish coach Hans Backe. Once again, Aalborg BK faced Dinamo Kyiv in the Champions League qualification, but again felt short, losing 1–2 at home and drawing 2–2 in Kyiv after a late Aalborg BK goal was disallowed for being behind the goal line. Since then, the club established itself in the top half of the Superliga and won a bronze medal and qualified for the 2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Aalborg beat Honka on the away goals rule (2–2 in Finland and 1–1 in Denmark) in the second round, and in the third and final round Aalborg BK faced Gent and drew, 1–1, in the away game but beat them 2–1 in the following home match. Thus they "won" a place in the UEFA Cup's second qualification round and met HJK, the first match ended 2–1 to Helsinki, but in the last match Aalborg BK won 3–0 and were thus ready for the UEFA Cup 2007-08. Drawing the Italian team Sampdoria in the First Round, which have Antonio Cassano and Vincenzo Montella as notable players, made the task seem impossible. Aalborg made it again on the away goal rule (getting 2–2 in Genoa and managing 0–0 in Aalborg), and qualified for the group stage – being the first Danish team ever, to send an Italian team "out of Europe." In the group stage Aalborg BK was seeded in the lowest pot, and drew Anderlecht, Tottenham Hotspur, Getafe, and Hapoel Tel Aviv. Drawing with Anderlecht at home, and losing 2–3 to Tottenham (after being ahead 2–0 after the first half) forced Aalborg to win at home against Getafe, a match Aalborg BK lost 1–2. In the 2007–08 season, Aalborg won their third Danish Championship and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds. in the second qualifying round, Aalborg easily eliminated FK Modriča 7–1 on aggregate. In the third round, before the group stage, they defeated FBK Kaunas 2–0 both at home and away and reached the group stage of the Champions League for the second time, the first time a Danish team achieved this. In the group stage, they were drawn in Group E along with defending champions Manchester United, Villarreal and Celtic. Aalborg finished third in the group, ahead of Celtic, with 6 points and progressed to the 2008–09 UEFA Cup knockout stage. Their first match in their UEFA Cup run was against Spanish side Deportivo de La Coruña. Aalborg BK won the first leg at home 3–0 and the second leg at the Estadio Riazor 1–3, securing a 6–1 aggregate. Aalborg BK thereby earned a place among the last 16 teams. where they faced Manchester City. After a 2–0 loss in Manchester in the first leg Aalborg BK fought back to tie the score with a 2–0 win at home. The tie ended in agony however, as Aalborg were defeated by 4–3 on penalties. On 11 May 2014, the club won their 4th Danish Championship, and four days later the double was secured, as the club defeated F.C. Copenhagen 4–2 in the Cup final. Stadium[edit] Main article: Nordjyske Arena The northern facade of Nordjyske Arena, 2008. Since 1920, Aalborg BK has played its games at Aalborg Stadion. The stadium was opened on 18 July 1920 with a north-south aligned playing field. The first spectator seats were built in 1927, and in 1937 a wooden terrace for 3,000 standing spectators was built. In 1960, the stadium burned down and a new east-western aligned concrete stadium was opened in 1962. In recent years the stadium has been enlarged and rebuilt so that it now has modern facilities and roof over all spectator stands.[5] The stadium currently has a capacity of 13,997 people (8,997 seats) or 10,500 people (all seats).

It was designed to replace the A-5C, F-7P/PG, Mirage III, and Mirage V combat aircraft in the Pakistan Air Force. The JF-17 can be used for multiple roles, including interception, ground attack, anti-ship, and aerial reconnaissance. Its designation "JF-17" by Pakistan is short for "Joint Fighter-17", while the designation and name "FC-1 Xiaolong" by China means "Fighter China-1 Fierce Dragon". The JF-17 can deploy diverse ordnance, including air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and a 23 mm GSh-23-2 twin-barrel autocannon. Powered by a Guizhou WS-13 or Klimov RD-93 afterburning turbofan, it has a top speed of Mach 1.6.[3] The JF-17 is to become the backbone of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), complementing the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon at half the cost.[4] The PAF inducted its first JF-17 squadron in February 2010.[5][6] In 2015 Pakistan produced 16 JF-17s.[6] As of 2016[update], Pakistan is believed to have the capacity to produce 25 JF-17 per year. 58% of the airframe is Pakistani and 42% Chinese/Russian-origin.[7] As of December 2016[update] Pakistan Aeronautical Complex has manufactured 70 jets in the country for use by the Pakistan Air Force of the Block 1 type,[8][9] and 33 jets of the Block 2 type.[10] The Pakistan Air Force plans, by 2017, to induct a twin-seater version known as the JF-17B for both enhanced operational capability and training.[11][12] Preparations for a more advanced and technologically sophisticated block III version of the aircraft are underway and the AESA radar, KJ-7A, has been developed, which can track 15 targets and engage 4 targets simultaneously.[13] Since its induction in 2011, the JF-17 Thunder has accumulated 19,000 hours of operational flight.[14] The JF-17 has seen active military service as it is used by the Pakistan Air Force to bomb militant positions in North Waziristan,[15] using both unguided munitions and guided missiles for precision strike capability.[7] Contents 1 Development 1.1 Background 1.2 Launch of FC-1 project 1.3 Flight testing and redesigning 1.4 Production 1.5 Further development 2 Design 2.1 Airframe and cockpit 2.2 Avionics 2.3 Propulsion and fuel system 2.4 Weaponry 3 Operational history 3.1 Pakistan 3.2 Nigeria 3.3 Myanmar 4 Accidents 5 Potential operators 6 Variants 6.1 Prototypes 6.2 Production variants 7 Operators 8 Specifications (JF-17 Block 2) 9 See also 10 References 10.1 Citations 10.2 Bibliography 11 External links Development Background The JF-17 was primarily developed to meet the Pakistan Air Force requirement for an affordable,[16] modern, multi-role combat aircraft as a replacement for its large fleet of Dassault Mirage III/5 fighters, Nanchang A-5 bombers, and Chengdu F-7 interceptors, with a cost of US$500 million, divided equally between China and Pakistan.[17] The aircraft was also intended to have export potential as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to more expensive Western fighters.[18][19][20] The development of this aircraft was headed by Yang Wei, who is considered China's "ace designer".[21] Yang also designed the Chengdu J-20. By 1989, because of economic sanctions by the US, Pakistan had abandoned Project Sabre II, a design study involving US aircraft manufacturer Grumman and China, and had decided to redesign and upgrade the Chengdu F-7.[22] In the same year, China and Grumman started a new design study to develop the Super 7, another redesigned Chengdu F-7.[23] Grumman left the project when sanctions were placed on China following the political fallout from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After Grumman left the Chengdu Super 7 project, the Fighter China project was launched in 1991.[24] In 1995, Pakistan and China signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for joint design and development of a new fighter, and over the next few years worked out the project details.[25] In June 1995, Mikoyan had joined the project to provide "design support", this also involved the secondment of several engineers by CAC.[26] Launch of FC-1 project A PAF JF-17 in Turkey in 2011 In October 1995, Pakistan was reportedly to select a Western company by the end of the year to provide and integrate the FC-1's avionics, which was expected to go into production by 1999. The avionics were said to include radar, Inertial navigation system, Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. Competing bids came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi Electronic Systems with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF.[27] In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 turbofan engine to power the fighter.[28] In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter.[29] Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 turbofan engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.[30] In June 1999, the contract to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar.[31][32] Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the air frame.[25] Prototype production began in September 2002; a full-size mock-up of the FC-1/Super 7 was displayed at Airshow China in November 2002.[33] The first batch of Klimov RD-93 turbofan engines that would power the prototypes was also delivered in 2002.[24] According to a China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) official, the JF-17's low cost is due to some of the on-board systems having been adapted from those of the Chengdu J-10. The official said, "This transfer of technology—transposing the aircraft systems from the J-10 to the JF-17—is what makes the JF-17 so cost-effective".[34][35] The use of computer-aided design software shortened the design phase of the JF-17.[36] Flight testing and redesigning The first prototype, PT-01, was rolled out on 31 May 2003[18][37] and transferred to the Chengdu Flight Test Centre to be prepared for its maiden flight.[25] This was initially planned to take place in June, but was delayed due to concerns about the SARS outbreak.[25][37] The designation Super-7 was replaced by "JF-17" (Joint Fighter-17) around this point.[38] Low speed taxiing trials began at Wenjiang Airport, Chengdu, on 27 June 2003.[24] The maiden flight was made in late August 2003;[18][38] an official maiden flight of the prototype took place in early September. The prototype was marked with the new PAF designation JF-17.[25] By March 2004, CAC had made around 20 test flights of the first prototype.[39] On 7 April 2004, PAF test pilots Rashid Habib and Mohammad Ehsan ul-Haq flew PT-01 for the first time. The maiden flight of the third prototype, PT-03, took place on 9 April 2004.[25] In March 2004, Pakistan was planning to induct around 200 aircraft.[40] Model Of JF-17 Thunder Following the third prototype, several design improvements were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke emissions by the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The vertical tail fin was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare equipment bay in the tip.[18][41][42] The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased maximum take-off weight and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF had selected Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, the winner of which was expected to be finalised in 2006.[43] PT-04, the fourth prototype and the first to incorporate the design changes, was rolled out in April 2006 and made its first flight on 28 April 2006.[41][44] The modified air intakes replaced conventional intake ramps—whose function is to divert turbulent boundary layer airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the engine—with a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design.[41] The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms,[45] and is stealthier than a conventional intake.[41] In 1999, developmental work on the DSI with the aim of improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001.[46] Multiple models underwent wind tunnel tests; it was found that the DSI reduced weight, cost, and complexity while improving performance.[45] For the avionics and weapons qualification phase of the flight testing, PT-04 was fitted with a fourth-generation avionics suite that incorporates sensor fusion, an electronic warfare suite, enhanced man-machine interface, Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) for the RD-93 turbofan engine, FBW flight controls, day/night precision surface attack capability, and multi-mode, pulse-Doppler radar for BVR air-to-air attack capability.[47] The sixth prototype, PT-06, made its maiden flight on 10 September 2006.[48] Following a competition in 2008, Martin-Baker was selected over a Chinese firm for the supply of fifty PK16LE ejection seats.[49] Production JF-17 at the Le Bourget Airport for the Paris 2015 Airshow On 2 March 2007, the first consignment of two small-batch-production (SBP) aircraft arrived in a dismantled state in Pakistan. They flew for the first time on 10 March 2007 and took part in a public aerial demonstration during a Pakistan Day parade on 23 March 2007. The PAF intended to induct 200 JF-17 by 2015 to replace all its Chengdu F-7, Nanchang A-5, and Dassault Mirage III/5 aircraft. In preparation for the in-flight refuelling of JF-17s, the PAF has upgraded several Mirage IIIs with IFR probes for training purposes.[50] A dual-seat, combat-capable trainer was originally scheduled to begin flight testing in 2006;[20] in 2009 Pakistan reportedly decided to develop the training model into a specialised attack variant.[51][52] In November 2007, the PAF and PAC conducted flight evaluations of aircraft fitted with a variant of the NRIET KLJ-10 radar developed by China's Nanjing Research Institute for Electronic Technology (NRIET), and the LETRI SD-10 active radar homing AAM.[53] In 2005, PAC began manufacturing JF-17 components; production of sub-assemblies commenced on 22 January 2008.[54][55] The PAF was to receive a further six pre-production aircraft in 2005, for a total of 8 out of an initial production run of 16 aircraft. Initial operating capability was to be achieved by the end of 2008.[56] Final assembly of the JF-17 in Pakistan began on 30 June 2009; PAC expected to complete production of four to six aircraft that year. They planned to produce twelve aircraft in 2010 and fifteen to sixteen aircraft per year from 2011; this could increase to twenty-five aircraft per year.[57] On 29 December 2015, Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) announced the rollout of the 16th JF-17 Thunder fighter manufactured in the calendar year 2015, taking total number of manufactured aircraft to more than 66. Later, a PAF spokesperson said that in light of the interest shown by various countries, it has been decided that production capacity of JF-17 Thunder at PAC Kamra will be expanded.[6] Russia signed an agreement in August 2007 for re-export of 150 RD-93 engines from China to Pakistan for the JF-17.[58] In 2008, the PAF reported it was not fully satisfied with the RD-93 engine and that it would only power the first 50 aircraft; it was alleged that arrangements for a new engine, reportedly the Snecma M53-P2, may have been made.[59] Mikhail Pogosyan, head of the MiG and Sukhoi design bureaus, recommended the Russian defence export agency Rosoboronexport block RD-93 engine sales to China to prevent export competition from the JF-17 against the MiG-29.[60][61] At the 2010 Farnborough Airshow, the JF-17 was displayed internationally for the first time; aerial displays at the show were intended but were cancelled due to a late attendance decision as well as license and insurance costs.[62] According to a Rosoboronexport official at the Airshow China 2010, held on 16–21 November 2005 in Zhuhai, China, Russia and China had signed a contract worth $238 million for 100 RD-93 engines with options for another 400 engines developed for the FC-1.[63] According to media reports, Pakistan planned to increase production of JF-17s by 25% in 2016.[64] Further development JF 17 Thunder at Paris Air Show Painted With Pakistan Flag Pakistan negotiated with British and Italian defence firms regarding avionics and radars for the JF-17 development. Radar options include the Italian Galileo Avionica's Grifo S7,[65] the French Thomson-CSF's RC400 (a variant of the RDY-2),[66] and the British company SELEX Galileo's Vixen 500E active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar.[19] In 2010, the PAF had reportedly selected ATE Aerospace Group to integrate French-built avionics and weapons systems over rival bids from Astrac, Finmeccanica and a Thales-Sagem joint venture. Fifty JF-17s were to be upgraded and an optional fifty from 2013 onwards, at a cost of up to US$1.36 billion. The RC-400 radar, MICA AAMs, and several air-to-surface weapons are believed to be in the contract. The PAF also held talks with South Africa for the supply of Denel A-darter AAMs.[67][68] In April 2010, after eighteen months of negotiations, the deal was reportedly suspended; reports cited French concerns about Pakistan's financial situation, the protection of sensitive French technology, and by Indian lobbying, which operates many French-built aircraft.[69][70] France wanted the PAF to purchase several Mirage 2000-9 fighters from the United Arab Emirates Air Force, which would overlap with the upgraded JF-17.[71] In July 2010, the PAF's Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman, said such reports were false, stating: "I have had discussions with French Government officials who have assured me that this is not the position of their government...someone was trying to cause mischief—to put pressure on France not to supply the avionics we want".[72] On 18 December 2013, production of Block 2 JF-17s began at PAC's Kamra facility.[73] These have an air-to-air refuelling capability, improved avionics, enhanced load carrying capacity, data link, and electronic warfare capabilities.[74] Block 2 construction is planned to run until 2016, after which the manufacturing of further developed Block III aircraft is planned.[75] In December 2015, it was announced that the 16th Block II aircraft had been handed over resulting in standing up of the 4th squadron.[76] On 17 June 2015, Jane's Defence Weekly confirmed[77] that JF-17 Block III will have an AESA radar, a helmet-mounted display (HMD) and possibly an internal infrared search and tracking (IRST) system.[78] A two-seat version was also reportedly be produced in Block III.[79] Unconfirmed reports claim that Block III will also have a better flight management system.[80] Selex ES has promoted its next-generation cockpit as a possible upgrade of JF-17 Block III; this cockpit includes a new mission computer, an enhanced head-up display and contemporary multi-function displays, plus the capability for the pilot to use a single, large-area display instead.[81] Design Front View Airframe and cockpit Block 1 HUD View The air frame is of semi-monocoque structure constructed primarily of aluminum alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The air frame is designed for a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours.[20] Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the air frame to reduce weight.[82] The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position and shape of the inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during maneuvers involving high angles of attack.[20] The mid-mounted wings are of cropped-delta configuration. Near the wing root are the LERX, which generate a vortex that provides extra lift to the wing at high angles of attack encountered during combat maneuvers. A conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement is incorporated, with all-moving stabilators, single vertical stabiliser, rudder, and twin ventral fins. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading-edge slats/flaps and Trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance.[20] The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.[48] The glass cockpit is covered by a transparent, acrylic canopy that provides the pilot with a good, all-round field of view. It has three large Multifunction Colour Displays (MFD) and smart Heads-Up Display (HUD) with built-in symbol generation capability. A centre stick is used for pitch and roll control while rudder pedals control yaw. A throttle is located to the left of the pilot. The cockpit incorporates hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a Martin-Baker Mk-16LE zero-zero ejection seat. The cockpit incorporates an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and a wide-angle, holographic head-up display (HUD), which has a minimum total field of view of 25 degrees. The EFIS comprises three colour multi-function displays, providing basic flight information, tactical information, and information on the engine, fuel, electrical, hydraulics, flight control, and environment control systems. The HUD and MFD can be configured to show any available information. Each MFD is 20.3 cm (8.0 in) wide and 30.5 cm (12.0 in) tall and is arranged side by side in portrait orientation. The central MFD is placed lowest to accommodate a control panel between it and the HUD.[20] Up to 3,629 kg (8,001 lb) of ordnance, equipment, and fuel can be mounted under the hardpoints, two of which are on the wing-tips, four are under the wings and one is under the fuselage.[20] Avionics The avionics software incorporates the concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling the use of the numerous civilian programmers available.[83] The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment.[20][84] The JF-17 has a defensive aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite housed in a fairing at the tip of the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage.[19] Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.[20] The first forty-two PAF production aircraft are equipped with the NRIET KLJ-7 radar,[85][86] a variant of the KLJ-10 radar developed by China's Nanjing Research Institute of Electronic Technology (NRIET) and also used on the Chengdu J-10. Multiple modes can manage the surveillance and engagement of up to forty air, ground, and sea targets; the track-while-scan mode can track up to ten targets at BVR and can engage two simultaneously with radar-homing AAMs. The operation range for targets with a radar cross-section (RCS) of 5 m2 (54 sq ft) is stated to be ≥ 105 km (65 mi) in look-up mode and ≥ 85 km (53 mi) in look-down mode.[86][87] A forward looking infrared (FLIR) pod for low-level navigation and infra-red search and track (IRST) system for passive targeting can also be integrated;[20] the JF-17 Block 2 is believed to incorporate an IRST.[82] In April 2016, Air Marshal Muhammad Ashfaque Arain said that, "JF-17 needs a targeting pod, as the jets' usefulness in current operations was limited due to lack of precision targeting. To fulfill this gap the Air Force was interested in buying the Thales-made Damocles, a third-generation targeting pod; which was a priority."[88] In 2017, Aselsans ASELPOD was tested and successfully integrated with the JF-17 and Pakistan has subsequently purchased at least eight targeting pods from Aselsan.[89] This integration has significantly enhanced the JF-17 platform's ability to launch precision strikes. A helmet-mounted sight (HMS) developed by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC was developed in parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006.[90][91] It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed to the public in 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display.[citation needed] The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target.[19] An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs).[20] An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods.[19] The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centers, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.[92] The aircraft uses RLGs along with GPS for navigation. The aircraft is equipped with an IFF Transponder which allows it to differentiate between friendly aircraft and enemy aircraft. The ACMI aids in aerial combat for maneuvering.[93] Propulsion and fuel system The first two blocks of JF-17 is powered by a single Russian RD-93 turbofan engine, which is a variant of the Klimov RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).[94] The RD-93 is known to produce smoke trails.[94] The Guizhou Aero Engine Group has been developing a new turbofan engine, the WS-13 Taishan, since 2000 to replace the RD-93. It is based on the RD-33 and incorporates new technologies to boost performance and reliability. A thrust output of 80 to 86.36 kN (17,980 to 19,410 lbf), a lifespan of 2,200 hours, and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.7 are expected. An improved version of the WS-13, developing a thrust of around 100 kN (22,000 lbf) (22,450 lb), is also reportedly under development.[95] During the 2015 Paris Air Show, it was announced that flight testing of a JF-17 equipped with the WS-13 engine had begun.[96] In 2015, a representative of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex said that Pakistan would continue to use the RD-93 engine on their fighters.[97] Local media reports in January 2016 said that Russia was planning to sell engines for JF-17 directly to Pakistan.[98] According to a PAC representative, Pakistan is looking to collaborate with Russia in developing and repairing engines.[99] The fuel system comprises internal fuel tanks located in the wings and fuselage with a capacity of 2,330 kg (5,140 lb); they are refuelled through a single point pressure refuelling system (see turbine fuel systems). Internal fuel storage can be supplemented by external fuel tanks. One 800-litre (180 imp gal) drop tank can be mounted on the aircraft's centerline hard point under the fuselage and two 800-litre or 1,110-litre (240 imp gal) drop tanks can be mounted on the two inboard under-wing hardpoints.[20] The fuel system is compatible with in-flight refueling (IFR), allowing tanker aircraft to refuel inflight, and increasing its range and loitering time significantly. All production aircraft for the PAF are to be fitted with IFR probes.[19] In June 2013, PAF Air Chief Marshal Tahir Rafique Butt said ground tests on the JF-17's refueling probes had been successfully completed and the first mid-air refuelling operations would commence that summer.[100] JF-17 Thunder with its weapons Thunder with weapons Weaponry The JF-17 can be armed with up to 4,325 kg (9,535 lb) of air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry, and other equipment mounted externally on the aircraft's seven hardpoints.[20] One hardpoint is located under the fuselage between the main landing gear, two are underneath each wing, and one is at each wing-tip. All seven hardpoints communicate via a MIL-STD-1760 data-bus architecture with the Stores Management System,[20] which is stated to be capable of integration with weaponry of any origin.[66] Internal armament comprises one 23 mm (0.91 in) GSh-23-2 twin-barrel cannon mounted under the port side air intake, which can be replaced with a 30 mm (1.2 in) GSh-30-2 twin-barrel cannon.[18][101] The wing-tip hard-points are typically occupied by short range infra-red homing AAMs. Many combinations of ordnance and equipment such as targeting pods can be carried on the under-wing and under-fuselage hard-points. Underwing hard-points can be fitted with multiple ejector racks, allowing each hard-point to carry two 500 lb (230 kg) unguided bombs or LGBs—Mk.82 or GBU-12. It is unknown whether multiple ejector racks can be used for ordnance such as beyond visual range (BVR) AAMs.[19] Active radar homing BVR AAMs can be integrated with the radar and data-link for mid-course updates. The Chinese PL-12/SD-10 is expected to be the aircraft's primary BVR air-to-air weapon, although this may change if radars of other origin are fitted. Short range, infra-red homing missiles include the Chinese PL-5E and PL-9C. The PAF is also seeking to arm the JF-17 with a fifth generation close-combat missile such as the PL10E IRIS-T or A-Darter. These will be integrated with the HMS/D and the radar for targeting.[19][20] Unguided air-to-ground weaponry includes rocket pods, gravity bombs and Matra Durandal anti-runway munitions. Precision-guided munitions such as LGBs and satellite-guided bombs are also compatible with the JF-17, as are other guided weapons such as anti-ship missiles and anti-radiation missiles.[20] Pakistan planned to bring the Brazilian MAR-1 anti-radiation missile into service on its JF-17 fleet in 2014.[102] Operational history Pakistan JF 17 ThunderSmall batch production of the single-seat, single-engine JF-17s began in China in June 2006. The first two small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered on 2 March 2007 and first flew in Pakistan on 10 March.[103] They took part in an aerial display on 23 March 2007 as part of the Pakistan Day Joint Services Parade in Islamabad.[104][105] Another six small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered by March 2008.[106] These were extensively flight-tested and evaluated by the PAF.[107] Two serial production aircraft were delivered from China in 2009 and the first Pakistani-manufactured aircraft was delivered to the PAF in a ceremony on 23 November 2009.[108] On 18 February 2010, the first JF-17 squadron, No. 26 Black Spiders, was officially inducted into the PAF with an initial strength of 14 fighter planes.[109][110] These aircraft first saw service in the anti-terrorist operation in South Waziristan, during which various types of weapons were evaluated.[111] They took part in the PAF's High Mark 2010 exercise from 29 April, where they were used by the Blue Force to attack Red Land surface targets with precision air-to-surface weapons.[112][113] A re-equipment ceremony for No. 26 Black Spiders Squadron took place on 11 April 2011, during which it was stated that the JF-17 had "revolutionized the PAF's operational concepts". The then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Rao Qamar Suleman said: "Today as we re-equip No 26 squadron, we have also raised No. 16 Squadron with the JF-17 Thunder aircraft. I would like to mention and appreciate the contribution and support of the Chinese in helping us acquire a technological breakthrough in the shape of this aircraft."[114] According to Pakistani forums, No 27 Squadron "Zarrars" replaced its Mirage 5EF with JF-17 in 2013.[115] No 2 Squadron currently tasked with sea strikes reequipped with JF-17s in Sept 2015 replacing the F7s.[116] No 16 Squadron "Black Panthers" has also been equipped with the JF-17.[117] The next squadron is supposed to be No 7 Squadron.[118] On 19 June 2017, it was reported that a JF-17 shot down an Iranian UAV operating in Pakistan's Pangjur District.[119] On 27 February 2019, during the tense standoff between India and Pakistan, Pakistan claimed that its JF-17s had shot down two Indian aircraft: a MiG-21 and a Su-30MKI, operating in Pakistan's airspace over the disputed region of Kashmir.[120][121] India, on the other hand, claimed to have shot down a Pakistani F-16, while losing a MiG-21 in the aerial engagement.[122] India denied the loss of any Su-30MKI and stated that all aircraft returned safely, whereas Pakistan denied the use or loss of any F-16 during the stand-off.[123][124] Nigeria In December 2014, during the International Defence Exhibition and Seminar in Karachi, Nigeria was reportedly buying between 25 and 40 JF-17s from Pakistan. Nigerian Air Force chief Air Marshal Adesola Nunayon Amosu had visited Pakistan earlier in October 2014.[125] Nigeria became the second customer in 2016 by placing an order for 3 planes. However, as the news reports value the deal at US$25 million, it is not clear if the item is misreported.[126][127] A June 2016 article in Jane's re-affirmed NAF budget for 3 JF-17, 10 Super Mushshak, and 2 Mi-35M aircraft in 2016.[128] According to Indian media, a deal to buy JF-17s might be signed in November with a MoU already signed.[129] The Nigerian Air Force has confirmed[130] it is expecting delivery of JF-17 for use in military operations against Jihadi militants in Northern Nigeria. In October 2018 Pakistan approved of the sale and local Nigerian production of three JF-17s for US$184.3 million. The aircraft are rumored to be of a later version than the initially agreed sale, providing more advanced systems.[131][132] Myanmar Official commissioning of 7 aircraft to Myanmar Air Force including 4 JF-17 Thunders. In July 2015, Myanmar ordered 16 JF-17 Thunder Fighter jets from Pakistan and China. Unlike the engines of Pakistani JF-17 Block I and Block II, Myanmar Air Force's JF-17s are using russian RD-33 engines. In late 2015, Myanmar ordered 16 RD-33 engines from Russia which were received in 2018 and 2019.[133] On 17 December 2018, Jane's disclosed that the Myanmar Air Force had received the first of up to 16 JF-17s it had ordered in 2015.[134] An official Myanmar Air Force video released on Air Force day showcased a number of JF-17s, both on static display and in the air.[135] Accidents Since its introduction, there have been several accidents involving the JF-17. On 14 November 2011, a JF-17 flying from PAF Base Minhas crashed during training exercises in the mountainous Mulla Mansoor region of the Attock District. According to the official PAF report, the crash was caused by a technical malfunction. Pakistani news reported that the pilot, Squadron Leader Muhammad Hussain, bailed out but was killed after his parachute failed to open, and that there were no civilian casualties reported. The pilot's body was discovered two kilometers from the crash site. This was the first known crash of a JF-17.[136][137][138][139][140] On 27 September 2016, a PAF JF-17 crashed during Exercise High Mark into the Arabian Sea. The pilot reportedly ejecting safely, though Martin-Baker, the manufacturer of the JF-17's ejection seats, later tweeted that the 15 September 2020 crash was the first ejection from a JF-17.[141][142] On 15 February 2020, a JF-17 Block 2 belonging to No.14 squadron 'Tail Choppers' crashed in Attock while on training mission. The pilot reportedly ejected and no casualties were reported. This was third crash of a JF-17 and second crash of the Block-2 variant.[143] A Pakistan Air Force (PAF) aircraft crashed near Pindigheb, Attock, on 15 September 2020 , the air force said in a statement.[144] While the PAF did not identify the aircraft, ejection seat manufacturer Martin-Baker, whose seats are installed in the JF-17, said in a Twitter post, “a Pakistan Air Force JF-17 aircraft crashed earlier today during a routine training mission, the pilot ejected successfully," adding that this marked the first instance of an ejection from a JF-17 aircraft, which uses its Martin-Baker PK16LE ejection seats, contradicting Pakistani reports of prior crashes.[145][142] Potential operators Various countries including Algeria, Ukraine, Argentina, Bulgaria,[146] Bangladesh,[147] Iraq,[148][149] Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,[150] Kuwait,[151] Albania, Sudan, Jordan, Peru,[149] Venezuela,[152] Sri Lanka,[153] Indonesia,[154] South Africa[155] and Uruguay have shown interest in the JF-17.[83][156] The Azerbaijani Air Forces negotiated with China for several dozen JF-17s worth approximately US$16 to 18 million each.[157] The Sudanese Air Force was reportedly negotiating to buy twelve aircraft.[158] The Air Force of Zimbabwe reportedly planned to purchase twelve JF-17s in 2004, as part of a $240 million deal with China. No such sales have materialized.[159][160] In 2010, China was reportedly in talks about the JF-17 with five or six countries, some of which had sent pilots to China to undergo test flights.[161] Argentine officials at the 2013 Paris Air Show said they had discussed JF-17 co-production with Chinese officials, calling it the first formal effort potentially leading to the co-production of a modern Chinese fighter in Latin America. Fábrica Argentina de Aviones (FAdeA) officials said the co-produced FC-1 could be called the "Pulqui-III", recalling FAdeA's Pulqui-II, Latin America's first swept wing jet fighter.[162] On 15 February 2015, after a three-day visit to Beijing by Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina completed negotiations to purchase twenty FC-1s from Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.[163] In January 2014, the Royal Saudi Air Force was reportedly examining potential technology transfer and co-production opportunities for the JF-17. Saudi Defence Minister Prince Salman bin Sultan toured the JF-17 project during a visit to Pakistan.[164][165] In June 2015, Pakistani media suggested that an export order had been confirmed with the Sri Lanka Air Force; claims were made that the JF-17's first sales contract had been signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force at the 51st Paris Air Show.[166][167] Other sources claimed that Myanmar is the first buyer of Pakistani JF-17s.[168] Reportedly, the order would cover around 18–24 aircraft and deliveries set to begin in 2017. During a state visit by Nawaz Sharif in January 2016, Sri Lanka reportedly signed an agreement to buy eight JF-17s from Pakistan;[169] however, the Sri Lankan government has issued denials.[170] The alleged deal was said to involve 10–12 aircraft, each valued at US$35 million, for a total of US$400 million[171] Reportedly, any such sale was scuppered by Indian diplomatic pressure.[172][173] Morocco has shown interest in the JF-17, having invited a sales team to showcase it in the Marrakech Air Show 2016.[174][175] According to a local analyst, a potential acquisition by Morocco may be complicated by incompatible technologies; the JF-17 Block I and Block II have broadly different electronics suites and air-to-air & air-to-surface munitions than its current Western-sourced aircraft, such as the Mirage F-1 (MF2000), F-5E/F Tiger II and Alpha Jet.[176] Variants Prototypes Two air frame configurations were tested during the prototype stage. The first configuration was tested on the first three prototype aircraft; PT-01, PT-02, and PT-03. The next three prototypes PT-04, PT-05, and PT-06 were of the second configuration, incorporating modifications such as DSI, wider LERX, extended ventral fins, and a taller, less swept vertical stabilizer with a rectangular fairing at the tip containing electronic warfare equipment and small blister fairings at the base containing Missile Approach Warning sensors. The PT-04 prototype was primarily used for avionics and weapon qualification tests.[177] Prototype-01 first flew in August 2003; Prototype-03 followed in April 2004. On 10 May 2006, Prototype 04 made its maiden flight.[178] In 2007, a dual-seat version for training and strike roles was proposed and due to the customer interests the development started in 2015.[51] According to the PAF, the JF-17B dual seat fighter jet is currently entering the testing phase.[179] Production variants JF-17A Block 1—Single-seat variant. Production in China began in June 2006.[18] The first three Chinese weapons to be integrated are the PL-5E II AAM, the SD-10 AAM, and the C-802A anti-shipping missile. Block 1 aircraft had performed "better than expected" according to PAF Air Commodore Junaid. Production of Block 1 was completed on 18 December when the fiftieth aircraft—58% of which was produced in Pakistan—was delivered.[180][181] A Block 1 JF-17 had cost approximately US$15 million per unit.[20] JF-17A Block 2—Single-seat variant. Production began on 18 December 2013 and initial testing began on 9 February 2015.[182] These aircraft have air-to-air refuelling capability, improved avionics, enhanced load carrying capacity, data link, and electronic warfare capabilities.[74] The construction will continue until 2016, after which the manufacture of Block 3 is planned.[75] A Block 2 JF-17 costs approximately US$25 million per unit.[183] Chairman of PAC, Air Marshal Javaid Ahmed said: "We will hand over 16 Block-II JF-17s to the PAF every year", and that the manufacturing plant has the capacity to produce 25 units in a year.[184] According to local media, PAC rolled out the 16th Block 2 aircraft in December 2015 enabling the JF-17's 4th squadron formation.[76] The JF-17B is a tandem two seat version would start testing in September 2016.[185] JF-17A Block 3—Single-seat variant. Projected to feature further avionics advancements such as helmet-mounted display and sight (HMD/S) system, a new single panel multi-functional display (MFD), an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) radar paired with an infrared search and track (IRST) system, and a cockpit with a flight-control stick on the side, an NRIET KLJ-7A AESA radar,[186][187] more use of composites, a new engine, and a two-seater cockpit option, with a top speed of 2.0+ Mach.[75][125][188] Pakistani Air Force officials have described it as a "fourth generation plus" fighter jet. According to unconfirmed media reports the induction is expected to start around 2019.[189] As of September 2016[update], the design of the JF-17 Block III has been finalized.[190][191][192][193] The PAF is expected to place an order for 50 JF-17 Block-III fighter jets in the first half of 2017.[194] JF-17B Block 2—Dual-seat variant, 8 of which were rolled out at PAC Kamra in December 2019. Its multi-roles include use as a (i) JF-17 conversion trainer; (ii) Lead-In Fighter Trainer (LIFT); (iii) ground-attack aircraft; and (iv) reconnaissance aircraft.[195] The production of the first JF-17B was initiated by Pakistan and China in 2016. On 28 April 2017, the JF-17B took its maiden test flight in Chengdu.[179] Operators Map with JF-17 operators in blue Myanmar Myanmar Air Force: designated JF-17M, 6 delivered, 10 on order[196][197][198][199] Meiktila Air Base[200] Nigeria Nigerian Air Force: 3 on order[201][202][203] Pakistan Pakistan Air Force: 135 delivered, 64 on order[204][205][206] PAF Base Minhas JF-17 TEF (Test and Evaluation Flight) (2007–2010)[207] PAF Base Peshawar[208] No. 26 Squadron Black Spiders (2010)[114] No. 16 Squadron Black Panthers (2011)[114] PAF Base Masroor No. 2 Squadron Minhasians (2015)[209] PAF Base Mushaf Combat Commanders School (CCS) Squadron Dragons (2015)[210] PAF Base Minhas No. 14 Squadron Tail Choppers (2017) PAF Base Samungli[204] No. 28 Squadron Phoenix (2018) Specifications (JF-17 Block 2) External image The glass cockpit of a JF-17 simulator Data from Pakistan Aeronautical Complex marketing brochure[211] and official website[212]General characteristics Crew: 1 (single-seat) or 2 (dual-seat) Length: 14.93 m (49 ft 0 in) Wingspan: 9.44 m (31 ft 0 in) Height: 4.77 m (15 ft 8 in) Wing area: 24.43 m2 (263.0 sq ft) Empty weight: 6,586 kg (14,520 lb) Max takeoff weight: 13,500 kg (29,762 lb) [213] Fuel capacity: 2,330 kg (5,137 lb) internal fuel; 1 x 800 kg (1,764 lb) centre-line drop tank; 2 x 800 kg (1,764 lb) or 1,100 kg (2,425 lb) under-wing drop tanks Payload: 4,600 kg (10,100 lb) external stores Powerplant: 1 × Klimov RD-93MA afterburning turbofan with digital electronic engine control (DEEC), 50.4 kN (11,300 lbf) thrust [214] dry, 85.6 kN (19,200 lbf) with afterburner Performance Maximum speed: 1,910 km/h (1,190 mph, 1,030 kn) Maximum speed: Mach 1.6[215] Cruise speed: 1,359 km/h (844 mph, 734 kn) Stall speed: 150 km/h (93 mph, 81 kn) Range: 2,500 km (1,600 mi, 1,300 nmi) Combat range: 1,352 km (840 mi, 730 nmi) Ferry range: 3,500 km (2,200 mi, 1,900 nmi) with 3 external drop tanks Service ceiling: 16,920[216] m (55,510 ft) g limits: +8/-3 (limited by flight control system) Rate of climb: 300 m/s (59,000 ft/min) Thrust/weight: 0.95 with RD-93 (with 50% internal fuel and 2*SRAAM) , 1.10 with WS-13 engine[217] Armament Guns: 1 × 23 mm GSh-23-2 twin-barrel cannon or 1 × 30 mm GSh-30-2 twin-barrel cannon Hardpoints: 7 (2 × wing-tip, 4 × under-wing, 1 × under-fuselage) with capacity for dual ejector racks on each under-wing hardpoint Missiles: **Air-to-air missiles: PL-5EII (within visual range missile) PL-9C (WVR missile) PL-10(Short-range) AIM-9L/M Sidewinder (Short-range) MAA-1 Piranha (Short-range) PL-8 (Short-range) PL-15 ( Very Long range Beyond Visual range missile) R-Darter (beyond visual range missile) SD-10A (PL-12 export version) (beyond visual range missile)[221] Air-to-surface missiles: CM-102 (anti-radiation missile)[221] LD-10 (anti-radiation missile) MAR-1 (anti-radiation missile) Ra'ad (Nuclear Stealth Cruise missile) Ra'ad MK-2 (Nuclear Stealth Cruise missile) Anti-ship missiles: C-802AK (anti-ship missile)[221][222] Exocet (anti-ship missile) C-803 (sea skimming anti-ship missile) Harpoon block-2 (anti-ship missile) CM-400AKG (anti-ship missile)[222] Bombs: ** Unguided bombs: Mk-80(General-purpose bomb) Mk-82 (General-purpose bomb) Mk-83 (General-purpose bomb) Mk-84 (General-purpose bomb) 250 kg Pre-fragmented bomb Matra Durandal (Anti-runway bomb) AWC HAFR-2 (Anti-runway bomb) AWC HAFR-1 (Anti-runway bomb) AWC RPB-1 (Anti-runway bomb) CBU-99 (Anti-armour cluster bomb) CBU-100 Cluster Bomb (Anti-armour cluster bomb) Guided bombs: GBU-10 (Laser-guided bomb) GBU-12 (Laser-guided bomb) GBU-16 (Laser-guided bomb) LT-2 (Precision-guided bomb) JDAM (Precision-guided bomb) H-4 SOW Stand off weapon (Precision-guided glide bomb) H-2 SOW Stand off weapon (Precision-guided glide bomb) Takbir (GPS/INS guided glide bomb) LS-6 (GPS/INS guided bomb)[218] Others: Range Extension Kit (GPS/INS guided bomb)[219] GDJ-II19 dual ejector rack[220] Countermeasures (Flares, Chaff)[214] Up to 3 external drop tanks (1 x 800 kg (1,764 lb) centre-line drop tank; 2 x 800 kg (1,764 lb) or 1,100 kg (2,425 lb) under-wing drop tanks) for extended range/loitering time[217] Avionics KLJ-7V2 Airborne Pulse Doppler Fire-Control Radar[223] ( Range-150 km for 3m2 RCS aircraft.)

He was one of the Five Good Emperors in the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.[4] Born into a senatorial family, Antoninus held various offices during the reign of emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor shortly before his death. Antoninus acquired the cognomen Pius after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the Senate to deify his adoptive father,[5] or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.[6] His reign is notable for the peaceful state of the Empire, with no major revolts or military incursions during this time, and for his governing without ever leaving Italy. A successful military campaign in southern Scotland early in his reign resulted in the construction of the Antonine Wall. Antoninus was an effective administrator, leaving his successors a large surplus in the treasury, expanding free access to drinking water throughout the Empire, encouraging legal conformity, and facilitating the enfranchisement of freed slaves. He died of illness in 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as co-emperors.

The Aurelii Fulvii were therefore a relatively new senatorial family from Gallia Narbonensis whose rise to prominence was supported by the Flavians.[9] The link between Antoninus' family and their home province explains the increasing importance of the post of Proconsul of Gallia Narbonensis during the late Second Century.[10] Antoninus’ father had no other children and died shortly after his 89 ordinary consulship. Antoninus was raised by his maternal grandfather Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus,[4] reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of Pliny the Younger.[11] The Arrii Antonini were an older senatorial family from Italy, very influential during Nerva's reign. Arria Fadilla, Antoninus' mother, married afterwards Publius Julius Lupus, suffect consul in 98; from that marriage came two daughters, Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla.[12] Marriage and children[edit] Some time between 110 and 115, Antoninus married Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder.[13] They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage. Faustina was the daughter of consul Marcus Annius Verus (II)[4] and Rupilia Faustina (a half-sister to the Empress Vibia Sabina). Faustina was a beautiful woman, and despite (basically unproven) rumours about her character, it is clear that Antoninus cared for her deeply.[14] Faustina bore Antoninus four children, two sons and two daughters.[15] They were: Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.[16][17] Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.[16][18] His name appears on a Greek Imperial coin. Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135); she married Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus, consul 145. She appeared to have no children with her husband; and her sepulchral inscription has been found in Italy.[19] Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or Faustina the Younger (between 125–130–175), a future Roman Empress, married her maternal cousin Marcus Aurelius in 146.[8] When Faustina died in 141, Antoninus was greatly distressed.[20] In honour of her memory, he asked the Senate to deify her as a goddess, and authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the Roman Forum in her name, with priestesses serving in her temple.[21] He had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor. These coins were scripted ‘DIVA FAUSTINA’ and were elaborately decorated. He further created a charity which he founded and called it Puellae Faustinianae or Girls of Faustina, which assisted destitute girls [13] of good family.[22] Finally, Antoninus created a new alimenta (see Grain supply to the city of Rome). The emperor never remarried. Instead, he lived with Galeria Lysistrate,[23] one of Faustina's freed women. Concubinage was a form of female companionship sometimes chosen by powerful men in Ancient Rome, especially widowers like Vespasian, and Marcus Aurelius. Their union could not produce any legitimate offspring who could threaten any heirs, such as those of Antoninus. Also, as one could not have a wife and an official concubine (or two concubines) at the same time, Antoninus avoided being pressed into a marriage with a noblewoman from another family (later, Marcus Aurelius would also reject the advances of his former fiancée Ceionia Fabia, Lucius Verus's sister, on the grounds of protecting his children from a stepmother, and took a concubine instead).[24][25][26] Favour with Hadrian[edit] Antoninus Pius, sculpture of c.250 AD, Albertinum, Dresden Having filled the offices of quaestor and praetor with more than usual success,[27] he obtained the consulship in 120[13] having as his colleague Lucius Catilius Severus.[28] He was next appointed by the Emperor Hadrian as one of the four proconsuls to administer Italia,[29] his district including Etruria, where he had estates.[30] He then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as proconsul of Asia, probably during 134–135.[29] He acquired much favor with Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138,[31] after the death of his first adopted son Lucius Aelius,[32] on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Lucius Aelius, who afterwards became the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus.[13] He also adopted (briefly) the name Imperator Titus Aelius Caesar Antoninus, in preparation for his rule.[33]There seems to have been some opposition to Antoninus' appointment on the part of other potential claimants, among them his former consular colleague Lucius Catilius Severus, then Prefect of the city. Nevertheless, Antoninus assumed power without opposition.[34] Emperor[edit] The Roman Empire during the reign of Antoninus Pius. On his accession, Antoninus' name and style became Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pontifex Maximus. One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the Senate to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused;[35] his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of Pius (dutiful in affection; compare pietas).[36] Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death.[8] Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus' proposal.[37] Antoninus built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of rhetoric and philosophy.[13] Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian.[35] Epigraphical and prosopographical research has revealed that Antoninus' imperial ruling team centered around a group of closely knit senatorial families, most of them members of the priestly congregation for the cult of Hadrian, the sodales Hadrianales. According to the German historian H.G. Pflaum, prosopographical research of Antoninus' ruling team allows us to grasp the deeply conservative character of the ruling senatorial caste.[38] A non-military reign[edit] The temple of Antoninus and Faustina in the Roman Forum (now the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda). The emperor and his Augusta were deified after their death by Marcus Aurelius. There are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated. One modern scholar has written "It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see, let alone command, a Roman army, but that, throughout the twenty-three years of his reign, he never went within five hundred miles of a legion".[39] His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the Principate,[40] notwithstanding the fact that there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time. Such disturbances happened in Mauretania – where a senator was named as governor of Mauretania Tingitana in place of the usual equestrian procurator[41] and cavalry reinforcements from Pannonia were brought in,[42] towns such as Sala and Tipasa being fortified.[43] Similar disturbances took place in Judea, and amongst the Brigantes in Britannia, none of them being considered serious.[40] It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new, more aggressive path, with the appointment of a new governor in 139, Quintus Lollius Urbicus,[35] a native of Numidia and previously governor of Germania Inferior[44] as well as a new man.[45] Under instructions from the emperor, Lollius undertook an invasion of southern Scotland, winning some significant victories, and constructing the Antonine Wall[46] from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde. The wall, however, was soon gradually decommissioned during the mid-150s and eventually abandoned late during the reign (early 160s), for reasons that are still not quite clear.[47][48] Antonine's Wall is mentioned in just one literary source, Antoninus' biography in the Historia Augusta. Pausanias makes a brief and confused mention of a war in Britain. In one inscription honoring Antoninus, erected by Legio II Augusta, which participated in the building of the Wall, a relief showing four naked prisoners, one of them beheaded, seems to stand for some actual warfare.[49] Statue of Antonius Pius in military garb and muscle cuirass, from the Museo Chiaramonti (Vatican Museums). Although Antonine's Wall was, in principle, much shorter (37 miles in length as opposed to 73) and at first sight more defensible than Hadrian's Wall, the additional area that it enclosed within the Empire was barren, with land use for grazing already in decay.[50] This meant that supply lines to the wall were strained enough such as the costs for maintaining the additional territory outweighed the benefits of doing so.[51] Also, in the absence of urban development and the ensuing Romanization process, the rear of the wall could not be lastingly pacified.[52] It has been therefore speculated that the invasion of Lowland Scotland and the building of the wall had to do mostly with internal politics, that is, offering Antoninus an opportunity to gain some modicum of necessary military prestige at the start of his reign. Actually, the campaign in Britannia was followed by an Imperial salutation – that is, by Antoninus formally taking for the second (and last) time the title of Imperator – in 142.[53] The fact that around the same time coins were struck announcing a victory in Britain points to Antoninus' need to publicize his achievements.[54] The orator Fronto was later to say that, although Antoninus bestowed the direction of the British campaign to others, he should be regarded as the helmsman who directed the voyage, whose glory, therefore, belonged to him.[55] That this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need is proved by the fact that, although generally peaceful, Antoninus' reign was not free from attempts at usurpation: Historia Augusta mentions two, made by the senators Cornelius Priscianus ("for disturbing the peace of Spain";[56] Priscianus had also been Lollius Urbicus' successor as governor of Britain) and Atilius Rufius Titianus (possibly a troublemaker already exiled under Hadrian.[57])Both attempts are confirmed by the Fasti Ostienses as well as by the erasing of Priscianus' name from an inscription.[58] In both cases, Antoninus was not in formal charge of the ensuing repression: Priscianus committed suicide and Titianus was found guilty by the Senate, with Antoninus abstaining from sequestering their families' properties.[59] There were also some troubles in Dacia Inferior which required the granting of additional powers to the procurator governor and the dispatch of additional soldiers to the province.[47] On the Northern Black Sea coast, the Greek city of Olbia was held against the Scythians.[60] Also during his reign the governor of Upper Germany, probably Caius Popillius Carus Pedo, built new fortifications in the Agri Decumates, advancing the Limes Germanicus fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring Raetia.[61] In the East, Roman suzerainty over Armenia was retained by the choice in AD 140 of Arsacid scion Sohaemus as client king.[62] Nevertheless, Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign,[63] but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed). This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.[64] Antoninus was the last Roman Emperor recognised by the Indian Kingdoms. Raoul McLaughlin quotes Aurelius Victor as saying "The Indians, the Bactrians and the Hyrcanians all sent ambassadors to Antoninus. They had all heard about the spirit of justice held by this great emperor, justice that was heightened by his handsome and grave countenance, and his slim and vigorous figure." Due to the outbreak of the Antonine epidemic and wars against northern Germanic tribes, the reign of Marcus Aurelius was forced to alter the focus of foreign policies, and matters relating to the Far East were increasingly abandoned in favour of those directly concerning the Empire's survival.[65] Economy and administration[edit] An aureus of Antoninus Pius, 145 AD. Inscription: ANTONINVS AVG. PIVS P. P. / TRibunicia POTestas COnSul IIII Antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder. In spite of an extensive building directive – the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts, not only in Rome but throughout the Empire, as well as bridges and roads – the emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasury of around two and a half million sesterces. Rome would not witness another Emperor leaving his successor with a surplus for a long time. But this treasury was depleted almost immediately after Antoninus's reign due to the plague brought back by soldiers after the Parthian victory.[66] The Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters, such as when fires struck Rome and Narbona, and earthquakes affected Rhodes and the Province of Asia. He offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes: the first, circa 140, which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands; the second, in 152, which hit Cyzicus (where the huge and newly built Temple to Hadrian was destroyed[67]), Ephesus, and Smyrna. Antoninus' financial help earned him praise by Greek writers such as Aelius Aristides and Pausanias.[68] These cities received from Antoninus the usual honorific accolades, such as when he commanded that all governors of Asia should enter the province, when taking office, by way of Ephesus.[69] Ephesus was specially favoured by Antoninus, who confirmed and upheld its distinction of having two temples for the imperial cult (neocorate), therefore having first place in the list of imperial honor titles, surpassing both Smyrna and Pergamon.[70] In his dealings with Greek-speaking cities, Antoninus followed the policy adopted by Hadrian of ingratiating himself with local elites, especially with local intellectuals: philosophers, teachers of literature, rhetoricians and physicians were explicitly exempted from any duties involving private spending for civic purposes – a privilege granted by Hadrian that Antoninus confirmed by means of an edict preserved in the Digest (27.1.6.8).[71] Antoninus also created a chair for the teaching of rhetoric in Athens.[72] Antoninus was known as an avid observer of rites of religion and of formal celebrations – both Roman and foreign. He is known for having increasingly formalized the official cult offered to the Great Mother, which from his reign onwards included a bull sacrifice, a taurobolium, formerly only a private ritual, now being also performed for the sake of the Emperor's welfare.[73] Antoninus also offered patronage to the worship of Mithras, to whom he erected a temple in Ostia.[74] In 148, he presided over the celebrations of the 900th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Legal reforms[edit] Copy inscribed in marble of a letter from Antoninus Pius to the Ephesians, from the Bouleuterion at Ephesus, 140–144 AD, explaining how the emperor resolved a dispute between the Roman cities of Ephesus and Smyrna. British Museum, London. Antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the res publica, no matter how extended and ill-defined his competencies were. He is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasury, the Fiscus. This splitting had to do with the division of imperial properties into two parts. Firstly, the fiscus itself – or patrimonium, meaning the properties of the "Crown", the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne, transmitted to his successors in office,[75] regardless of their previous membership in the imperial family.[76] Secondly, the res privata, the "private" properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor and his family,[77] something like a Privy Purse. An anecdote in the Historia Augusta biography, where Antoninus replies to Faustina – who complained about his stinginess – that "we have gained an empire [and] lost even what we had before" possibly relates to Antoninus' actual concerns at the creation of the res privata.[78] While still a private citizen, Antoninus had increased his personal fortune greatly by mean of various legacies, the consequence – we are told – of his caring scrupulously for his relatives.[79] Also, Antoninus left behind him a reputation for stinginess and was probably determined not to leave his personal property to be "swallowed up by the demands of the imperial throne".[80] The res privata lands could be sold and/or given away, while the patrimonium properties were regarded as public.[81] It was a way of pretending that the Imperial function – and most properties attached to it – was a public one, formally subject to the authority of the Senate and the Roman people.[82] That the distinction played no part in subsequent political history – that the personal power of the princeps absorbed his role as office-holder – proves that the autocratic logic of the imperial order had already subsumed the old republican institutions.[83] Of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information, but, to judge by what is extant, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after the reign.[11] However, Antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire.[84] One of his chief concerns was to having local communities conform their legal procedures to existing Roman norms: in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers ("irenarchs", Greek for "peace keepers") in Asia Minor, Antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned, and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations, to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor.[85] Also, although Antoninus was not an innovator, he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into Roman law many important new principles based upon this notion.[84] In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: Lucius Fulvius Aburnius Valens, an author of legal treatises;[86] Lucius Ulpius Marcellus, a prolific writer; and three others.[84] Of these three, the most prominent was Lucius Volusius Maecianus, a former military officer turned by Antoninus into a civil procurator, and who, in view of his subsequent career (discovered on the basis of epigraphical and prosopographical research), was the Emperor's most important legal adviser.[87] Maecianus would eventually be chosen to occupy various prefectures (see below) as well as to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius. He was also the author of a large work on Fidei commissa (Testamentary Trusts). As a hallmark of the increased connection between jurists and the imperial government,[88] Antoninus' reign also saw the appearance of the Institutes of Gaius, an elementary legal manual for beginners (see Gaius (jurist)).[84] Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the enfranchisement of slaves.[89] Mostly, he favoured the principle of favor libertatis, giving the putative freedman the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clearcut.[90] Also, he punished the killing of a slave by his/her master without previous trial[91] and determined that slaves could be forcibly sold to another master by a proconsul in cases of consistent mistreatment.[92] Antoninus upheld the enforcement of contracts for selling of female slaves forbidding their further employment in prostitution.[93] In criminal law, Antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are not to be treated as guilty before trial[89] – as in the case of the irenarchs (see above). It was to Antonius that the Christian apologist Justin Martyr addressed his defense of the Christian faith, reminding him of his father's (Emperor Hadrian's) rule that accusations against Christians required proof.[94] He also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held, and the punishment inflicted, in the place where the crime had been committed. He mitigated the use of torture in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions.[89] However, it must be stressed that Antoninus extended, by means of a rescript, the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases, when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases.[95] Also, already at the time torture of free men of low status (humiliores) had become legal, as proved by the fact that Antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it, and also free men of high rank (honestiores) in general.[96] One highlight during his reign occurred in 148, with the nine-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of Rome being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome.[97] It lasted a number of days, and a host of exotic animals were killed, including elephants, giraffes, tigers, rhinoceroses, crocodiles and hippopotami. While this increased Antoninus's popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89% to 83.5% – the actual silver weight dropping from 2.88 grams to 2.68 grams.[47][98] Scholars name Antoninus Pius as the leading candidate for an individual identified as a friend of Rabbi Judah the Prince. According to the Talmud (Avodah Zarah 10a–b), Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with "Antoninus", possibly Antoninus Pius,[99] who would consult Rabbi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters. Death[edit] Ruins of the triumphal arch of Antoninus Pius outside the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore in Eleusis, Greece, imitating Hadrian's Arch in Athens In 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without stays. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. Marcus Aurelius had already been created consul with Antoninus in 140, receiving the title of Caesar – i.e., heir apparent.[100] As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still after the death—in 156 or 157—of one of Antoninus' most trusted advisers, Marcus Gavius Maximus, who had been praetorian prefect (an office that was as much secretarial as military) for twenty years.[101] Gavius Maximus, who had been one of the most important members of Antoninus' "team" of long standing advisers, had been awarded with the consular insignia and the honors due a senator.[102] He had developed a reputation as a most strict disciplinarian (vir severissimus, according to Historia Augusta) as well as some lasting grudges among fellow equestrian procurators – one of them, by predeceasing Gavius and vilifying him in his will, created a serious embarrassment to one of the heirs, the orator Fronto.[103] Gavius Maximus' death offered the opportunity to a welcome change in the ruling team, and it has been speculated that it was the legal adviser Lucius Volusius Maecianus who—after a brief spell as Praefect of Egypt, and a subsequent term as Praefectus annonae in Rome – assumed the role of grey eminence precisely in order to prepare the incoming – and altogether new – joint succession.[104] In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Antoninus was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out.[105] The bust of Antoninus Pius at the Museo del Prado, Madrid Two days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at Lorium, in Etruria,[106] about twelve miles (19 km) from Rome.[107] He ate Alpine Gruyere cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, 7 March 161,[108] he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered: when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the password, he responded, "aequanimitas" (equanimity).[109] He then turned over, as if going to sleep, and died.[110] His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus (surpassing Tiberius by a couple of months).[111] His record for the second-longest reign would be unbeaten for 168 years, until 329 when it was surpassed by Constantine the Great. Antoninus Pius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, "elaborate".[112] If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius, while his spirit would rise to the gods' home in the heavens. However, it seems that this was not the case: according to his Historia Augusta biography (which seems to reproduce an earlier, detailed report) Antoninus' body (and not his ashes) was buried in Hadrian's mausoleum. After a seven-day interval (justitium), Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification.[113] In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A flamen, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now Divus Antoninus. A column was dedicated to Antoninus on the Campus Martius,[13] and the temple he had built in the Forum in 141 to his deified wife Faustina was rededicated to the deified Faustina and the deified Antoninus.[109] It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.[114] Diplomatic mission to China[edit] See also: Sino-Roman relations Green Roman glass cup unearthed from an Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb, Guangxi, China The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded in 166 AD by the Hou Hanshu.[115] The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from "Andun" (Chinese: 安敦; Emperor Antoninus Pius), "king of Daqin" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius (Antoninus), and the envoy arrived in 166, confusion remains about who sent the mission given that both Emperors were named 'Antoninus'.[116][117][118] The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier province of Jiaozhi at Rinan or Tonkin (present-day northern Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia.[115][119] The text specifically states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries.[115][120] Furthermore, a piece of Republican-era Roman glassware has been found at a Western Han tomb in Guangzhou along the South China Sea, dated to the early 1st century BC.[121] Roman golden medallions made during the reign of Antoninus Pius and perhaps even Marcus Aurelius have been found at Óc Eo in southern Vietnam, then part of the Kingdom of Funan near the Chinese province of Jiaozhi.[122][123] This may have been the port city of Kattigara, described by Ptolemy (c. 150) as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and lying beyond the Golden Chersonese (i.e., Malay Peninsula).[122][123] Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius to Aurelian have been discovered in Xi'an, China (site of the Han capital Chang'an), although the significantly greater amount of Roman coins unearthed in India suggest the Roman maritime trade for purchasing Chinese silk was centered there, not in China or even the overland Silk Road running through ancient Iran.[124] Historiography[edit] Arch of Antoninus Pius in Sbeïtla, Tunisia. Statue of Antoninus Pius, Palazzo Altemps, Rome The only intact account of his life handed down to us is that of the Augustan History, an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain.[125] Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies. In later scholarship[edit] Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as Edward Gibbon[126] or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition.[11] A few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname κυμινοπριστης "cummin-splitter"). Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.[11] Some historians have a less positive view of his reign. According to the historian J. B. Bury, however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian’s activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian.[127] German historian Ernst Kornemann has had it in his Römische Geschichte [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised "a succession of grossly wasted opportunities", given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing. Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders. Michael Grant agrees that it is possible that had Antoninus acted decisively sooner (it appears that, on his death bed, he was preparing a large-scale action against the Parthians), the Parthians might have been unable to choose their own time, but current evidence is not conclusive. Grant opines that Antoninus and his officers did act in a resolute manner dealing with frontier disturbances of his time, although conditions for long-lasting peace were not created. On the whole, according to Grant, Marcus Aurelius' eulogistic picture of Antoninus seems deserved, and Antoninus appears to have been a conservative and nationalistic (although he respected and followed Hadrian's example of Philhellenism moderately) Emperor who was not tainted by the blood of either citizen or foe, combined and maintained Numa Pompilius' good fortune, pacific dutifulness and religious scrupulousness, and whose laws removed anomalies and softened harshnesses.[128] Krzysztof Ulanowski argues that the claims of military inability are exaggerated, considering that although the sources praise Antoninus' love for peace and his efforts "rather to defend, than enlarge the provinces", he could hardly be considered a pacifist, as shown by the conquest of the Lowlands, the building of the Antonine Wall and the expansion of Germania Superior. Ulianowski also praises Antoninus for being successful in deterrence by diplomatic means.[129] Descendants[edit] Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to four generations of prominent Romans, including the Emperor Commodus. Hans-Georg Pflaum has identified five direct descendants of Antoninus and Faustina who were consuls in the first half of the third century.[130] Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (died before 138), died young without issue Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138), died young without issue Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135), who married Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus, suffect consul in 145;[131] no children known for certain. Faustina the Younger (16 February between 125 and 130–175), had several children; those who had children were:[132] Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla (7 March 150–182?), whose children included: Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina (151–?), whose children included: Tiberius Claudius Severus Proculus Empress Annia Faustina, Elagabalus' third wife Fadilla (159–?)

He studied chemistry in Münster and Munich and earned his PhD 1984 in Munich with an investigation into the structure and function of halorhodopsin, a light-driven chloride pump in Halobacterium halobium. As a postdoc, he worked in the research groups of Dieter Oesterhelt (1984 to 1985) and with Kenneth W. Foster at Syracuse University (1985 to 1986). In 1986, he started a research group in the Department of Membrane Biochemistry at the Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry in Frankfurt, Germany. He became professor at the University of Regensburg and was appointed full professor at the Humboldt-University of Berlin in 2004. In 2015, he was awarded a Senior Research Professor position in Neuroscience by the Hertie Foundation. Contents 1 Research 2 Awards 3 References 4 External links Research[edit] Hegemann, together with Georg Nagel, is credited with the discovery of channelrhodopsins, a family of directly light-gated ion channels. This discovery has opened the new field of optogenetics, manipulating the activity of neurons and other cells with light. Since the original discovery of channelrhodopsin in the green alga Chlamydomonas, Hegemann and his group have improved its properties by molecular engineering, resulting in a wide variety of designer opsins which are faster, more sensitive, responsive to different colors of light, or conduct different ions than natural channelrhodopsins. These molecular tools have enabled neuroscientists around the world to stimulate genetically defined populations of neurons non-invasively and with great precision.

The type species is C. spanios, described by Gaetano and Rougier in 2012. Classification[edit] One of the only two known South American eutriconodonts, Condorodon differs from the somewhat older Argentoconodon, a relative of Volaticotherium, in the morphology of the molariform teeth. It is closely related to the Late Jurassic amphilesthere Tendagurodon from the Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania, Africa.[1] References[edit] ^ L. C. Gaetano and G. W. Rougier. 2012.

He was born to Pietro degli Stefani, but was the godson to Masuccio Primo, hence his name. He traveled to Rome for some years. King Robert of Naples commissioned the church of Santa Chiara, but Masuccio remained in Rome, and hence came to the construction project after it had been started. He designed the church of Santa Maddalena sul colle Echia, San Martino, and the bell tower of Santa Chiara. References[edit] Minieri-Riccio, Camillo (1844).

After receiving some education at a nearby free school, he was apprenticed to a general shopkeeper at Burgh. On the expiration of his term he became assistant in a shop at East Retford, Nottinghamshire, of which he in time became proprietor. Here he began to associate with a group of Congregationalists, for whom he sometimes preached. In 1806 he gave up business and entered Rotherham College. His college course finished, he became minister at Southend, Essex. After a residence of eighteen months there he was appointed classical tutor in Rotherham College. On 8 December 1818 he was ordained pastor of the Nether Chapel, Sheffield, still retaining the tutorship, spending the Sundays and Mondays in Sheffield and the rest of the week at Rotherham. In July 1817 he became minister of Fish Street Chapel, Kingston upon Hull. In November 1825 he removed to James Street Chapel, Nottingham. A new meeting-house was built for him in April 1828 in Friar Lane, Nottingham, and in this he ministered from then on. His health giving way, he resigned his charge in November 1851, and he died on Sunday, 12 December, 1852 at the age of 73. Works[edit] In 1808, at the request of Dr. Edward Williams, Principal of Rotherham College, he published his first book, a reply to a work by the Rev. William Bennet, entitled ‘Remarks on a recent Hypothesis respecting the Origin of Moral Evil, in a Series of Letters to the Rev. Dr. Williams, the author of that Hypothesis.’ During his pastorate at Hull he published a ‘Life of Dr. Williams’ (1825). In 1835 he delivered in London the course of Congregational lectures by which he was best known, entitled ‘The Christian Atonement, its Basis, Nature, and Bearings, or the Principle of Substitution illustrated as applied in the Redemption of Man’ (London, 1836). He published also, during his Rotherham tutorship, a sermon on ‘The Power of God in the Soul of Man.’ After his death one of his sons issued ‘Recollections of Discourses’ which he preached in the years of 1848–50, with ‘A Biographical Sketch’ by his widow prefixed (1853). Family[edit] He was twice married, in May 1800 to Miss Sarah Chapman, daughter of a surgeon at Burgh, and in December 1813 to Ann Taylor, eldest daughter of the Rev. Isaac Taylor of Ongar. They had seven children, including the eldest son Josiah Gilbert (1814-1892) who became an artist, and Joseph Henry Gilbert.[1][2] References[edit] "Gilbert, Joseph (1779-1852)" .

It has rough, ribbony bark near the base, smooth grey to brownish above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of seven, yellow to cream-coloured flowers and cup-shaped or urn-shaped fruit. Contents 1 Description 2 Classification 3 Distribution 4 Conservation status 5 See also 6 References Description[edit] Eucalyptus dolichocera is a mallee, rarely a tree, that typically grows to a height of 6 m (20 ft) and has rough, ribbony, grey-brown or red-brown bark on the lowest 2–3 m (6 ft 7 in–9 ft 10 in) of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped, slightly glaucous up to 70 mm (2.8 in) long and 15 mm (0.59 in) wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, dull green, 70–130 mm (2.8–5.1 in) long and 13–25 mm (0.51–0.98 in) wide on a petiole 15–18 mm (0.59–0.71 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle 10–16 mm (0.39–0.63 in) long, the individual buds on a pedicel 4–8 mm (0.16–0.31 in) long. Mature buds are oval, 13–20 mm (0.51–0.79 in) long and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) wide with a narrow conical operculum up to three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between October and November and the flowers are yellow to cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to urn-shaped capsule 7–9 mm (0.28–0.35 in) long and 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in) wide with the valves enclosed below the rim.[2][3][4][5] Classification[edit] Eucalyptus dolichocera was first formally described by the botanists Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson and Ken Hill in 1999 in the journal Telopea. The type specimen was collected by Ian Brooker and Donald Blaxell in 1975 about 80 km (50 mi) north east of Kalbarri on the North West Coastal Highway.[3][6] The specific epithet (dolichocera) is derived from the Ancient Greek words dolichos meaning "long"[7]:494 and keros meaning "horn"[7]:195 referring to the long narrow operculum.[5] This species belongs to the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus in the section Bisectae and the subsection Destitutae. It is similar in appearance to Eucalyptus moderata.[5] Distribution[edit] This mallee grows in laterite, limestone or sand on dunes, flats and sandplains and has a range from just north of Geraldton to Dowerin and Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee and Yalgoo biogeographic regions.[2][5] Conservation status[edit] Eucalyptus dolichocera is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife[2] See also[edit] Trees portal List of Eucalyptus species References[edit] ^ "Eucalyptus dolichocera".

He is the great-grandson of James Wolcott Wadsworth (U.S. Congress, New York) and grandson of James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. (U.S. Congress, New York) and great-grandson of John Hay. James attended St. Bernard's School in New York City, St. Louis Country Day School in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1945, he graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps at the age of 17.[1] He served in the Marine Corps as a private first class from 1945 to 1946. Symington earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1950 where he sang as a member of the Whiffenpoofs and the Glee Club.[2] He also joined Berzelius secret society (according to the 1950 Yale Banner). He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1954. Early legal career and public service[edit] After graduating from law school, Symington served for two years as Assistant City Counselor (1954–1955) for St. Louis. In 1958, Symington entered the United States Foreign Service and was posted to London as assistant to John Hay Whitney, the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom and his cousin once removed on his mother's side.[3] He served in this role until 1960, when he returned to private practice in Washington, D.C.. He served in a series of roles in government from 1961 to 1968: deputy director, Food for Peace (1961–1962); administrative assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (1962–1963); director, President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency (1965–1966); consultant, President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice (1965–1966); and Chief of Protocol of the United States (1966–1968). Congressional career[edit] In 1968, Symington was elected as a Democrat to the 91st Congress to represent Missouri's 2nd Congressional District. He served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1969 to 1977. While in Congress, he served on the House Commerce Committee and the Committee on Science and Technology, chairing the subcommittees on Space Science and Applications; Science, Research & Technology; and International Cooperation. In the 1976 election, he chose not to seek his seat for a fifth term; rather, he made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by his father, who retired after serving four terms. He faced Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes and Congressman Jerry Litton in the Democratic primary. Litton won the primary but was killed when his plane crashed en route to the victory party. Hearnes was named the Democratic candidate and ultimately lost to Republican Party candidate John Danforth. At the end of his congressional term, Symington returned to the D.C.-based law firm Smathers, Symington & Herlong as a partner. Post-congressional roles[edit] Symington in 2001 Symington served as director of The Atlantic Council from 1986 to 2001, and as director of the Library of Congress Russian Leadership Program in 2001. In 1992, he founded the American-Russian Cultural Cooperation Foundation, which he chaired from its inception until 2015.[4][5] He also made occasional appearances as a singer.[6] Symington appeared as a commentator in the 1990 Ken Burns film The Civil War.[7] As of 2001, he was practicing law with the law firm of Nossaman LLP/O'Connor & Hannan, where he specializes in legislative and administrative representation.[8][9] Symington is also a writer. A collection of his poems, songs, and prose, A Muse 'N Washington: Beltway Ballads and Beyond , was published in 1999. Notes[edit] ^ "Goldwaters not only father-son team in congress".

It can be found from Texas to Delaware. In Florida, this sanguinivorous (blood-feeding) fly is seen as an adult from March through September, but is most active from May to mid-July. The female has the ability to sense carbon dioxide, which helps it feeds on mammals, especially during the night when it is most active. The larvae are also predaceous and live in the soil adjacent to water and on floating vegetation but can also live in forest sand.[4] The insect's blood is blue. The fly's eyes are brown, but glow yellow under 385 nm UV light.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ a b "Chlorotabanus crepuscularis Report". Integrated Taxonomic Information System.

A paramedic in Australia is a health care professional who responds to and treats all types of medical and trauma emergencies outside of a hospital setting before and during transportation to an appropriate medical facility. Paramedics also work in the inter-facility transport environment where a paramedic will continue or upgrade medical care to a higher level while transporting a patient from one healthcare facility to another. Paramedics are able to treat patients in the pre-hospital setting, and can transport them to a hospital-based emergency department if deemed necessary. A new paramedic is evolving, the Paramedic Practitioner. The Paramedic Practitioner provides primary health care in a range of health settings and forms part of a multidisciplinary medical team. In Australia, use of the term paramedic is lawfully restricted to the use of those registered with AHPRA. Contents 1 Definition of a paramedic 2 Education and training 2.1 First responder 2.2 Patient transport officers 2.3 Ambulance transport officer/attendant 2.4 Paramedic 2.5 Intensive care, critical care or mobile intensive care ambulance paramedic 2.6 Paramedic Practitioners 2.7 Graduate internship 3 Clinical scope of practice 3.1 First responder 3.2 Patient transport officer 3.3 Ambulance officer / Ambulance transport attendant 3.4 Paramedic 3.5 Intensive care, critical care or mobile intensive care ambulance (MICA) paramedic 3.6 Rescue or special operations paramedic 3.7 Retrieval or flight paramedic 4 Employment 5 Professional organisations 6 History 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Definition of a paramedic[edit] Starting in December 2018, The titles ‘paramedic’ and ‘paramedicine’ became protected by law and only people registered with the Paramedicine Board of Australia (National Board) can legally call themselves a paramedic. According to the Paramedicine Board of Australia "From 1 December 2018 paramedicine becomes a nationally regulated profession under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (National Law) and the titles ‘paramedic’ and ‘paramedicine’ will become protected by law. This means that from 1 December 2018, only people who are registered with the Paramedicine Board of Australia (the Board) or who have applied for registration before 1 December 2018 will be able to lawfully call themselves a paramedic." Some people with exceptional circumstances have until February 28, 2019 to register if they wish to use the title of "Paramedic". Beyond that date, any person calling themselves a paramedic may be charged with an offence under National Law, (s 113(1)(a), s 116(1)(b), s 116(1)(c)and/or s 116(1)(d). [1] Prior to being nationally regulated, the title paramedic was generally used to identify a person with a diploma or bachelor's degree in paramedicine. Most were employed by ambulance services, although those engaged in emergency health care in areas such as industrial sites or volunteer first aid services sometimes referred to themselves as a paramedic. Some states and territories did have protection of title legislation to protect the use of the title of paramedic in that state to those who are qualified to use it (e.g. Health Services Amendment (Paramedics) Bill 2015 (NSW)). The qualifications were not specific educational qualifications but are generally those employed by their state ambulance service or those holding a qualification such as paramedic degree. Australian paramedics at work Education and training[edit] The Australian government indirectly regulates paramedic training by means of a series of nationally recognised numbered certificates through the Australian Qualifications Framework, intended to provide a relatively common level of competencies. Regardless, local standards are regulated by state governments, and standards and definitions of terms vary widely between states. Many individuals possessing Certificates I-III may work in industrial first aid, for commercial first aid companies, or as non-emergency transporters or emergency ambulance services (particularly as volunteers). Possession of a Diploma of Health Science or a Bachelor of Paramedicine is regarded as the minimum entry level for emergency work in most statutory ambulance services, although some ambulance services require much higher qualifications. Apart from paramedics, other titles are used by some organizations for emergency medical response personnel. First responders are sometimes utilized in remote areas to provide advanced first aid training until paramedics arrive. Transport officers work in a non emergency setting, usually transporting stable patients from one health care facility to another, or providing transport for non-ambulatory people to prearranged medical appointments at a health care facility. First responder[edit] A Certificate II in Emergency Medical Response is used by some organisations. The term is non-specific and unregulated, and is used by private first aid companies, volunteer organisations, workplaces and State ambulance services to describe many levels of advanced first aid training.[2] Patient transport officers[edit] Patient transport officers must, at a minimum, complete a course of training that will earn them a nationally recognised Certificate III in Non-Emergency Patient Transport. Again, the use of the term is unregulated.[3] Ambulance transport officer/attendant[edit] Generally speaking, the statutory ambulance services in Australia require training to a Certificate IV level as the entry level for basic life support providers.[4] The one exception to this is the State of Queensland, which still permits entry at the Certificate I level, or at Certificate IV. Though in other states like Victoria a Diploma of Paramedical Science (Ambulance), is required to transport more acute patients. This is possible in either the state run ambulance service (AV), or in some of the private ambulance transport companies. Paramedic[edit] Paramedics in Australia's statutory ambulance services are all educated to advanced life support Level (ALS). The base qualification for a paramedic is a diploma or bachelor's degree (in health science, paramedic science, emergency health or paramedicine) or a postgraduate diploma (pre-master's – for health professionals converting to paramedicine).[5] Some paramedic degrees are dual, that is with another discipline, for example Bachelor of Paramedicine/Bachelor of Nursing.[6] In some states, paramedics can still undergo an in-service (post employment) diploma or advanced diploma level of education. This involved on-the-job training using the nationally recognised diploma with several years of supervised practice. Post-employment training is slowly being phased out in most states of Australia, with New South Wales being one of the last to continue to use it in a limited way. Victoria and South Australia have completely ceased all in-service education, with other states gradually reducing post-employment training as the supply of graduate paramedics from universities meets industry demands.[7] Generally and increasingly, the standard for entry into practice requires graduation from a university.[8] Intensive care, critical care or mobile intensive care ambulance paramedic[edit] Intensive care (IC) paramedics, or mobile intensive care ambulance (MICA) paramedics, have completed post-graduate education that allows them to have a primary role of supporting paramedics by providing in-field stabilisation and mobile intensive care.[9] Graduates have completed a university-level post-graduate diploma in Intensive Care Paramedical Practice, Emergency Health (MICA Paramedic) or equivalent in addition to their base qualification and graduate (internship) program.[citation needed] Paramedic Practitioners[edit] The Australasian health landscape is changing, with ever increasing demand, particularly due to increasing chronic co-morbidity, aging populations, increasing range of technological interventions requiring a health workforce that is innovative and flexible. The Paramedic Practitioner role is an opportunity to better utilise the skills and competencies of a long-term member of the health workforce.[10] The Paramedic Practitioner is defined as; “A Paramedic Practitioner is a Paramedic who has undergone top up education to be able to: order and interpret tests (pathology/imaging); perform physical examinations; prescribe medications (including restricted drugs); refer to specialists and/or allied health; and provide or delegate treatment in any health environment” [11] Education of a Paramedic Practitioner is at Master degree level with the ability to complete further education to graduate with a Doctor of qualification(Consultant Paramedic Practitioner).[12] Training time to become a Paramedic Practitioner, including undergraduate studies, internship, clinical practice and post graduate studies, is around ten years. The key role for Paramedic Practitioners is to provide a medical service with a range of community centred aims; - Keeping people from declines in health by using preventative health measures - Keeping people safe in their home and community - Keeping Doctors in their community - Keeping Emergency Ambulances available - Keeping Emergency Departments presentations down - Keeping patients in Primary Care & out of hospital - Keeping healthcare effective and cost efficient - Keeping up in a changing world of health care [13] Graduate internship[edit] Unlike educational programs in the United States, Canada and other countries, graduates from an Australian university degree in paramedicine are not usually considered 'road ready' by statutory ambulance authorities. Although their academic credential is internationally recognized, in order to be a fully recognized paramedic, University graduates must complete an 'internship year' with an EMS agency.[14] This can only be done once the graduate student has been hired by the EMS agency. Ambulances and more Clinical scope of practice[edit] Please note that these terms and qualifications vary slightly between states. These are the minimum qualifications, but some states require more advanced training to hold these positions. For example, in Victoria, "Ambulance Transport Attendants" (ATA) (who primarily work for non-emergency private companies) are now required to hold a Diploma,[15] and the term "Ambulance Paramedic" (Victoria) can also be referred to as "Advanced Care Paramedic" (Queensland). First responder[edit] In some locations, volunteer first responders are used by ambulance services to begin basic treatment before a paramedic arrives. Their training is a high standard of advanced first aid.[16] In some states volunteer "Ambulance Officers" have similar training to First Responders. Patient transport officer[edit] Patient transport officers (PTOs), or ambulance transport officers, provide non-emergency patient transport. PTOs provide a pre-booked, non-urgent service that includes home to hospital and hospital to hospital transfers.[17] In some states, PTOs may occasionally be required to act as first responders to emergencies. This is usually limited to situations where it would take significantly longer for paramedics to arrive at the scene than a nearby patient transport crew, or where patients that are assessed to be low-risk and require a low level of care in transit. Also, as many patient transport ambulances carry a second stretcher, non-emergency ambulance officers can be utilised to assist emergency crews in incidents involving numerous casualties. In Victoria, PTOs & AAs will respond to Medium Acuity 000 calls that are dispatched through the ESTA Referral Service. Ambulance officer / Ambulance transport attendant[edit] This is the basic level of pre-hospital emergency care. These paramedics hold a Certificate IV Health Care (Ambulance) (previously known as Certificate IV in Emergency Care), or equivalent, and are trained in basic life support skills. Paramedic[edit] Paramedics practice includes all components of the basic life support level and the further enhancement of IV cannulation, drug therapy (oral, intramuscular injection (IM), intravenously (IV), narcotic pain relief, anti-emetics, cardiac arrest, respiratory drugs, etc.), fluid resuscitation, advanced airway management (usually a laryngeal mask airway [LMA], or endotracheal intubation and Cricothyroidotomy in Western Australia) and the maintenance of infusions. Paramedics perform extensive physical assessment, blood examinations (e.g. random glucose test), interpret electrocardiograms (ECG), SpO2, temperature, and provide care for a range of patients from the new born to the elderly. Intensive care, critical care or mobile intensive care ambulance (MICA) paramedic[edit] ICP or MICA paramedics are able to practice intensive care procedures such as endotracheal intubation, surgical airways, rapid sequence intubation (RSI), nasotracheal intubation, chest tube insertion, and drug infusions (e.g. Adrenaline, Salbutamol, sedation, thrombolytics etc.). IC or MICA paramedics practice under clinical practice guidelines independently of medical control.[18] The Council of Ambulance Authorities is currently lobbying for an expanded scope of practice to permit more primary care by advance care paramedics, including the role of paramedic as independent practitioner.[19] Rescue or special operations paramedic[edit] Some ambulance services employ paramedics specially trained in rescue or special operations techniques.[20] Officers can be trained in areas such as road crash rescue, vertical rescue, confined space and trench rescue.[21] They learn navigation skills, four wheel driving, urban search and rescue, and chemical biological and radiological procedures. Retrieval or flight paramedic[edit] Retrieval or flight paramedics work on fixed wing and helicopter aircraft in many states, performing both emergency and routine transport operations. They are generally considered to be extremely highly trained in emergency medical care, but also aviation medicine, rescue and aviation emergencies. In some states this role is performed by a Flight Nurse or Flight Doctor with specialist qualifications in Intensive Care or Emergency Medicine who is then supported by a Flight Paramedic who is usually credentialed at Critical Care, IC or MICA level. Australian air ambulances Employment[edit] Paramedics are employed by various public and private service providers. The state run ambulance services are activated by the 000 (or 112 for mobile phones) emergency number. Paramedics may respond to medical incidents in a conventional ambulance, sedan, 4WD, rescue vehicle, helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft, motorcycle or even bicycle or foot at large public gatherings. There are also private transport ambulances which are crewed by Patient Transport Officers (or sometimes Ambulance Attendants and/or nurses). They generally transport non-emergency patients between hospitals and other health settings such as nursing homes.[22] In Australia paramedic salaries range to over $130,000 a year, depending on location, experience, supervisory responsibilities and overtime. Professional organisations[edit] Paramedics Australasia is one of two professional organisations that represent and deliver Professional Development for paramedics www.paramedics.org. The Australian and New Zealand College of Paramedicine (ANZCP) is the other.[23] During late 2019, Australia's first specialist paramedicine college was founded, The Australasian College of Paramedic Practitioners (ACPP) www.acpp.net.au. The sole aim of the College is to introduce Prescribing Paramedic Practitioners and Paramedics into Primary Health Care [24]. ACPP has been instrumental in supporting the development of the Deakin (University) Medicine Master and Doctor of Advanced Clinical Practice (Paramedic Practitioner)[25]. ACPP has achieved many strategic alliances with Medical, Nursing and Allied Health organisations who are supportive of ACPP push to introduce a Paramedic Practitioner model. ACPP is the only paramedicine organisation who has membership of the National Prescribing Service [26] It will be interesting to watch the development of Paramedic Practitioners into the future. The College celebrates Paramedic Practitioner Day on the 10th October every year. The day came about after the announcement of the introduction of Paramedic Practitioners into the Victorian Health System by the then Minister of Health and Ambulance Services the Hon Jill Hennessy. Industrial representation varies from state to state. Registered paramedic unions in Australia include Ambulance Employees Australia (AEA), which represents paramedics in Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. The Health Services Union is another registered union in the industrial field. Unregistered organisations include Australian Paramedics Associations (APA), Victorian Ambulance Union (VAU), and the Emergency Medical Services Protection Association (EMSPA). VAU was established in 2019 as a breakaway organisation from the AEAV after a dispute between members and United Voice during a union merger with the National Union of Workers. Members were concerned about losing their autonomy and governing rules within the AEAV. The rules of the AEAV are the same since the merger. The VAU is now the biggest Ambulance and Paramedic Union in Australia with close to 5,000 members. The Emergency Medical Services Protection Association (EMSPA) represents a new chapter in legal and industrial representation and protection for paramedics and employees. EMSPA is a professional organisation representing nearly 2000 paramedics in New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria in industrial and other work-related matters. Established in 2005 by paramedics seeking improved representation on employment-related matters, this association has been extremely successful in representing the rights and entitlements of paramedics since its inception and as a result continues to grow in membership numbers.[27] History[edit] Prior to the 1970s, most ambulance services in Australia were staffed by paid and volunteer staff called "drivers" or "ambulance drivers", "bearers" or "ambulance bearers". Qualifications were often no more than possession of a first aid certificate or a home nursing course certificate. Some were trained to administer Trichloroethylene (an anesthetic/pain relief), while bandaging and splinting skills often formed the core of training sessions. The Victorian Civil Ambulance Service (VCAS)in 1970, introduced the Mobile Intensive Care Ambulance (MICA) program. Victorian Ambulance Services followed up in the mid 1980s with the continuing education programme (CEP)7 "Defibrillation" which introduced manual defibrillation to all ambulance officers who were not MICA paramedics. In the 1970s Queensland commenced formal training blocks at the Ambulance Officer's training College, based on the Victorian Ambulance Officer's Training Centre or AOTC. The AOTC model duplicated in most Australian States until the introduction of University education. Over the next few years, some ambulance officers throughout Australia were trained in varying levels of coronary care, allowing them to treat patients with both manual and semi automatic defibrillators. The use of semi automatic defibrillators and 3 lead ECG cardiac monitoring became standard in New South Wales and Queensland. By the 1990s Queensland Ambulance Service trained recruits in conjunction with South Brisbane TAFE. After completing a three-year course, graduates were presented with an associate Diploma in Heath Science (later a Diploma) and became "Qualified Ambulance Officers". Existing staff completed bridging courses. From the mid 1990s Charles Sturt University, and Victoria University offered Bachelor Degree conversion courses for qualified ambulance officers and paramedics. In 1999 Victoria University offered the first pre-service Bachelor of Health Science (Paramedic), this was closely followed by Charles Sturt University and Flinders University. Today, University Bachelor degree qualifications in Paramedicine are the only pathway to gaining employment with Australian ambulance services except NSW.

Originally compact in size (narrow-body), later Camry models have grown to fit the mid-size classification (wide-body)—although the two sizes co-existed in the 1990s. Since the release of the wide-bodied versions, Camry has been extolled by Toyota as the firm's second "world car" after the Corolla. In Japan, Camry was once exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store retail dealerships. Narrow-body cars also spawned a rebadged sibling in Japan, the Toyota Vista (トヨタ・ビスタ)—also introduced in 1982 and sold at Toyota Vista Store locations. Diesel fuel versions have previously retailed at Toyota Diesel Store. Between 1979 and 1982, the Camry nameplate was delegated to a four-door sedan model in Japan, known as the Celica Camry. When Camry became an independent model line in 1982 with the V10 series, Toyota made it available as a five-door liftback in addition to the sedan. The subsequent Camry V20 series, debuted in 1986 with a station wagon substituting the liftback body variant and Japan-only hardtop sedans making their debut. The company replaced the V20 in 1990 with the V30 sedan and hardtop, but this model series was exclusive to Japan. Automotive tax regulations in that country dictated the retention of a narrower body as used in previous Camry generations. However, overseas demand for a larger Camry resulted in the development of a wide-body XV10 sedan and station wagon that arrived in 1991. Japan also received the wider XV10 as the Toyota Scepter (トヨタ・セプター). The company then issued an XV10-bodied coupé in 1993 that was spun off in 1998 as an independent model line, titled Camry Solara. When the Japanese market received a new narrow-body V40 series in 1994 to replace V30, the wide-body XV10 continued unchanged. Its replacement, the XV20, arrived in 1996—named Camry Gracia in Japan. It was not until the narrow V40 ended manufacture in 1998 that the Camry in Japan was to again mirror the cars sold internationally. Japanese sedans dropped the Gracia suffix in 1999, although it was retained by the wagon until its 2001 demise. From 1998, the Vista ended its Camry alignment, and instead branched into an independent model line with the V50 series for an extra generation before the nameplate was withdrawn in 2003. The next wide-body model, the XV30, came in 2001. Now sold only as a sedan, it now offered two different front- and rear-end design treatments. Japan and most global markets received one style; a separate, more conservative version covered markets in East and Southeast Asia. With the XV40 of 2006, the Camry-derived Aurion become the donor model for the more conservative Camry sold in this region. The subsequent XV50 series, sold from 2011 until 2019, has resulted in even more markets adopting the alternative body panels, such as Japan and Eastern Europe. The current generation is called the XV70. When Toyota launched their luxury Lexus brand in 1989, it offered a close derivative of the Camry/Vista hardtop sedan as the Lexus ES. The relationship continues to this day, but over the generations, the ES—sold as the Toyota Windom in Japan from 1991 through to 2005—gravitated further away from its Camry brethren. Between 2000 and 2010 and since 2012, Daihatsu has offered a badge engineered Camry as the Daihatsu Altis (ダイハツ・アルティス) sold only in Japan. Badge engineering has also occurred in Australia with the Holden Apollo between 1989 and 1996. From 1993, Toyota Australia badged V6-engined versions as Camry Vienta, becoming Toyota Vienta in 1995 until the badge's departure in 2000. Between 2006-2017, the Toyota Aurion model from Australia was derived from the V6 Camry, but with revised front-end and rear-end styling treatment and a partially refurbished cabin.

Toyota designated this initial application of the Camry name as the A40/A50 series. Celica Camry made its sales debut in January 1980[6] at Toyota Corolla Store retail dealerships in Japan.[7] Production had earlier commenced in December 1979 at the Tsutsumi plant at Toyota, Aichi.[8] Despite the marketing position, Celica Camry shares few components with its namesake—but rather the Carina (A40/A50).[9] Toyota modified the Carina by elongating its front-end and incorporating styling cues such as the T-bar grille motif that resembled the Celica XX/Supra (A40). Strictly speaking, Celica Camry is not the first generation of Camry, but rather its predecessor. Celica Camry uses the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and in A40 guise, a standard four-link rigid axle suspension system with gasoline inline-four engines displacing 1.6 liters for the 12T-U (TA41) and 1.8 liters with the 13T-U (TA46).[9] Initial model grades comprised: 1600 LT, 1600 XT, 1800 LT, 1800 XT,[10] and 1800 XT Super Edition. In August 1980, Toyota released high-end models with four-wheel independent suspension, denoted A50 (front MacPherson struts, rear semi-trailing arm setup; four-wheel disc brakes).[9][11][12] For the TA57 series 1800 SX, Toyota fitted the 1.8-liter 3T-EU engine.[11][12] Toyota designated the new 2.0-liter grades, the 21R-U powered 2000 SE and 18R-GEU-based 2000 GT as RA56 and RA55, respectively.[11][12] V10 (1982–1986)[edit] V10Camry DX sedan (US; facelift)OverviewAlso calledToyota VistaProductionMarch 1982 – August 1986Model years1983–1986AssemblyJapan: Toyota, Aichi (Tsutsumi plant)Body and chassisBody style4-door sedan5-door liftbackLayoutTransverse front-engine, front-wheel-drivePowertrainEngine1.8 L I4 gasoline (1S-L,-LU)1.8 L I4 gasoline (1S-iLU)2.0 L I4 gasoline (2S-EL,-ELC,-ELU)2.0 L I4 gasoline (3S-GELU)1.8 L I4-T diesel (1C-TL,-TLC)2.0 L I4-T diesel (2C-TL,-TLC)Transmission5-speed manual4-speed automaticDimensionsWheelbase2,600 mm (102.4 in)Length4,400–4,435 mm (173.2–174.6 in) (sedan)4,435 mm (174.6 in) (liftback)Width1,690 mm (66.5 in)Height1,395 mm (54.9 in) (sedan)1,370 mm (53.9 in) (liftback)Curb weight990–1,130 kg (2,180–2,490 lb) Toyota started production of the first generation series Camry in March 1982 at the Tsutsumi plant.[8] Designated the model code V10, when fitted with S-series gasoline engines it was known as the SV10, SV11, or SV12 depending on the exact version.[13] Likewise, the C-series diesel versions are identified by the CV10 and CV11 codes.[13] Released to the Japanese market on 24 March 1982, Toyota issued the V10 series as a four-door notchback sedan retailing at the Toyota Corolla Store dealerships.[14] At the same time, a twinned model—the Toyota Vista—launched as a rebadged Camry sold at separate Toyota Vista Store locations.[15] Five-door liftback versions of the Vista came to the market in August 1982,[16] although outside of export markets the Camry remained exclusively a sedan. These cars served above the comparably sized Toyota Carina and Corona in the Toyota hierarchy. Unlike the preceding Celica Camry, exports were achieved with the first generation Camry to Australia, Europe and North America.[17] Camry ZX sedan (Japan; pre-facelift)Camry ZX sedan (Japan; pre-facelift)Camry GLi liftback (Australia; pre-facelift)Camry GLi liftback (Australia; pre-facelift)Vista liftback (Japan; facelift)Vista VF-II sedan (Japan; facelift)Camry LE liftback (US; facelift) Development of the V10 series Camry and Vista began in August 1977 following the 1973 oil crisis and would later cover the 1979 crisis.[17][18] Automobile manufacturers were making the inexorable move to downsized, lighter, more fuel efficient cars with better aerodynamic performance.[19][20] The industry also began wide-scale switching from the rear-wheel-drive layout to the lighter and more compact front-wheel-drive in the interest of increased fuel economy.[21][22] With a development focus on exports, particularly to the US,[17] Toyota designed Camry to replace the Corona T130 in many overseas markets.[23] It needed to compete with the compact, front-drive Honda Accord sedan from Japan.[24] Via one-upmanship, Camry exceeded the Accord's wheelbase by 150 mm (5.9 in) and offered larger engines.[24] The design brief also established the compact front-wheel-drive X platform vehicles by General Motors in the US as competitors.[17][25] In light of this competition—and a first for Toyota—the V10 adopted front-wheel drive with the engine transversely mounted.[26] Between this layout that reduced the size of the engine compartment, the notchback sedan and liftback bodies with rear quarter windows, and the longer wheelbase of 2,600 mm (102.4 in)—the V10 series was considered spacious for its time and class.[17][27] Furthermore, by situating the fuel tank underneath the back seat, luggage space is increased.[28] The styling of the V10 followed the box-shaped trends characteristic of the early 1980s.[25] Wind tunnel testing led to the fitment of drag-reducing flush pillars, a flat roofline to reduce wind buffeting, and one-piece front bumper with air dam to direct air flow.[29] Drag coefficient is quoted at Cd=0.38 for the sedan and Cd=0.36 for the liftback.[29] Coil spring independent suspension features by way of a MacPherson strut type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel lower arms.[28] Steering uses a rack and pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double proportioning valve to suppress lock-up.[28] Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect worn-out brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.[28] Powertrain design was reassessed for front-wheel-drive and this generated a foundation for which other models were developed.[17] The transaxle is connected inline with the engine, and to create a simple and compact structure, a single rail system that replaces the three shafts normally used for each gear range with a single shaft, was adopted. In addition, automatic transmission fluid was used for the lubricating oil in order to reduce friction.[17] Existing gasoline S- and diesel C-series engines were converted for use in transverse applications.[17] Initially, the V10 featured the 1.8-liter 1S-LU engine good for 100 PS (74 kW) and an S50 five-speed manual transmission.[16][27] From July 1982, four-speed automatic with overdrive became available after starting manufacture the previous month.[16][27][30] The 2.0-liter 2S-ELU engine with 120 PS (88 kW) an improved S51 five-speed manual transmission and four-speed automatic followed in August.[16][27] August 1983 saw the 1.8-liter 1C-TL turbocharged diesel offered (80 PS or 59 kW)[16][27] exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Toyota Diesel Store.[31] June 1984 introduced the twin-cam 2.0-liter 3S-GELU engine offered on higher trims with 140 or 160 PS (103 or 118 kW) depending on the version.[16][27][32][33] For lower trims, the 85 PS (63 kW) "Ci" 1.8-liter 1S-iLU arrived.[13] The diesel was upgraded to the 2.0-liter 2C-TL specification in August 1985 (88 PS or 65 kW).[16][27] Japanese trims levels initially comprised LT, XT, SE, and ZX for Camry sedan.[13][34] Lumiere and XE grades came to the market in June 1984, and the GLi TwinCam in May 1985.[34] Vista sedan and liftback specification levels were at first VC (sedan only), VL, VE, and VX.[13] The VF arrived in August 1982, and VR and VS models in June 1984 at the expense of the departing VE.[13] Special edition models comprised: VE Extra (December 1982), VL Extra (January 1983), VL Super Extra (January 1985), VF-II (April 1985 and April 1986), and VL Grand Extra (December 1985 and April 1986).[35] Wing mirrors became door-mounted as opposed to fender-mounted in May 1983.[35] Facelifted models arrived in June 1984[34] featuring a new grille, redesigned bumpers,[36] revised tail-lamps, updated dashboard, enlarged glovebox, and general trim alterations.[37] The shift to smaller cars amid the oil crises doubled Japanese automobile market share from 10 to 20 percent in the United States between 1970 and 1980; thus, causing economic tensions between the two nations.[18][38] Toyota then began investigating the option of building a US production facility, following the announcements in January and April 1980 by Honda and Nissan, respectively, to manufacture automobiles locally.[18] As investigations proceeded, Toyota proposed entering a joint venture with Ford in May 1980 to produce a compact car.[18] Toyota advocated that its Camry be manufactured at a Ford factory and sold through the sales channels of both brands, but Ford deemed Camry to be in competition with a model it was developing, which became the Ford Tempo, leading to an impasse and then the cessation of negotiations in July 1981.[18] Increasing Japan–United States unease culminated with the Japanese government, at the urging of its US counterpart, imposing a voluntary cartel in May 1981 with a threshold for the export of motor vehicles to the US.[39] Toyota would eventually pursue circumvention; firstly by entering into venture by forming NUMMI with General Motors in 1984 to manufacture the Toyota Corolla,[40] and then by setting up its own facility at Georgetown, Kentucky in 1988 for the next generation Camry.[41] Sales of the V10 Camry in the US began in March 1983 after exports commenced in January, and by 1985 it had sold 128,000 units.[17][42] Unlike other markets, federalized quad headlamps were fitted for the 1983 and 1984 model years. Buyers could specify sedan or liftback bodies with a five-speed manual transmission or extra-cost four-speed automatic paired to the 2.0-liter gasoline 2S-ELC motor rated at 92 hp (69 kW).[43] Toyota then offered DX (deluxe) and LE (luxury edition) trim levels,[44] the latter adding standard features such as body-colored bumpers, tachometer, tilt steering wheel, upgraded stereo, electric mirrors and variable intermittent windscreen wipers.[45] Updates for the 1984 model year included an overdrive lockout switch for the automatic transmission.[37] Also optional was the manual-only 1.8-liter 1C-TLC turbo diesel for the DX with 73 hp (54 kW), a special gauge cluster, and quieter exhaust system.[37] Changes for 1985 involved the facelift (now with one-piece headlamps), the transfer of the optional cruise control's switchgear from the dashboard to the wiper stalk, and wider LE-type tires for the DX trim (from 165 to 185 millimeters or 6.5 to 7.3 inches).[45] 1985 cars received gas-charged front shock absorbers and stiffer rear springs, an anti-theft alarm system was now optional on both grades, automatic became an option for the diesel, the DX added a standard tilt steering wheel, and the LE models offered an optional electronic instrument cluster.[37] For 1986, a replacement diesel engine, the automatic-only 2.0-liter 2C-TLC arrived for the DX and LE (79 hp or 59 kW), and the gasoline model increased power by around 3 hp (2 kW).[37] Other revisions for this model year were a revised powered brake system and new cloth seat and door trim for LEs.[37] For Australia, the Camry range—based on the Vista front styling—was limited to a single-grade GLi liftback variant between April 1983 and April 1987.[36][46] Sold as an upmarket alternative to the locally produced Corona T140, the sole powertrain offered was the gasoline 2.0-liter 2S-EL engine with 77 kW (103 hp) coupled with the five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.[36] Optional extras included powering steering, air conditioning, electric moonroof, power doors and windows, plus an upgraded stereo.[28] Facelifted models with more standard appointments arrived in August 1984, and the unleaded version from early 1986 reduced power output by 2 kW (3 hp).[36] Europe and the United Kingdom received both body variants when released there in mid 1984—these were available in the gasoline DX trim (1.8- 1S-L) and 2.0-liter GLi (2S-EL) or the GLD turbo diesel (1.8- 1C-TL in early models; later models upgraded to the 2.0-liter 2C-TL).

Entry-level customers were offered the carry-over "Ci" 1.8-liter 1S-i (designated 1S-iLU in the V10) inline-four with five-speed manual or an automatic with four gears.[69][70] Stepping up from this were the new 3S-FE and GT high-performance 3S-GE (designated 3S-GELU for V10s) 2.0-liter twin-cam four-cylinder cars.[47][48] Turbo-diesel models were again limited to the 2C-T motor displacing 2.0 liters (labeled 2C-TL for V10s).[69][70] Transmission were either a five-speed manual or an electronically controlled automatic with four gears.[47][48] When launched in Japan, the V20 series Camry (sedan only) offered the following trim levels: LT, XT, XT Saloon, ZE, ZT, ZX, and GT.[69] For the Vista sedan, Toyota offered: VC, VL, VE, VR, and VX. Hardtop versions comprised: VE, VR, VX, and GT.[70] Flagship models of the Japanese specification Camry sedan, the Camry Prominent and Prominent G arrived in April 1987 with the 2.0-liter 1VZ-FE V6 engine, a protruding chrome grille, larger North American-type bumpers, wood grain interior highlights, an electric seat function, plus electronic instrument cluster.[47][69] Full-time four-wheel-drive became an option in October 1987 with select 3S-FE manual variants (VL Extra, VR); automatics equipped with an electronic front- and rear-wheel torque distribution optimizer followed in August 1988.[69][70][71] The Vista was not available with the V6, but in April 1987, the special edition Vista VL Extra sedan and hardtop arrived, followed by the Etoile in August and again in January 1989; limited edition Etoile V cars were offered in September 1989 and January 1990.[70][72] Toyota discontinued the Vista VC in December 1989 and released a special edition VX Limited in May 1989 and then again for January 1990.[71][72] When the Camry Prominent hardtop variant arrived in August 1988,[73] it offered base, G, and E-Type levels of trim alongside a new sedan-only Camry Lumière.[71] Also in August 1988, a diesel version of the Vista hardtop made its debut, and the 1.8-liter gasoline engine was upgraded to the twin-cam 4S-Fi specification.[69][70] Special editions for the Camry comprised: Lumière S sedan (January 1989), Prominent X hardtop (May 1989), Lumière G sedan (June 1989), and XT Saloon Special sedan (January 1990).[71] North American market V20 series Camry sedan and wagons came to the market in late 1986 for the 1987 model year.[49][74] Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky, the first wholly owned Toyota plant in the US, began producing the Camry in May 1988.[42] The country of manufacture can be found by looking at the first character of the VIN; a Camry manufactured in Japan has a VIN starting with "J", a model made in the US starts with "4" and a model made in Australia starts with "6". All Camry station wagons for the United States originated from Japan, while sedans were a mix of Japanese built and American built, with the ratio of American built sedans increasing yearly. Three trim levels of the V20 Camry were made: the unbadged base model, the DX, and the LE. The four-wheel-drive Camry, dubbed All-Trac was introduced for 1988 and a 2.5-liter V6 engine was also added as an option. The V6 was fuel-injected with 24 valves, and dual overhead camshafts. The 1989 model year saw the Camry’s mid life update which included new front and rear bumper covers that were one piece instead of two, new taillight design, along with a few interior styling updates. The 1990 model year saw a slight upgrade in horsepower for V6 models, from 153 to 156. North American 1990 Camrys built from February 1990-August 1990 also saw another refresh that included Toyota’s new logo introduced that year onto the front grille. Color keyed door handles and grille also appeared on DX and LE models, along with a new ignition chime. In 1989, anti-lock brakes became optional on the LE V6 sedan and wagon, and LE All-Trac. 1991 model year Camrys began production in August 1990, and can be identified by a newly redesigned front valence panel under the front bumper. In addition, the DX model gains new standard color keyed bumpers, new interior cloth that replaces the older tweed, and new hubcap designs on both DX and LE models. Toyota Australia released the second generation Camry in April 1987.[46] Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria as a replacement for the Corona T140 and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant, all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totaling A$115 million.[66][75][76] In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture.[77] Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter 3S-FE motor,[66] but the imported 1.8-liter 1S-i unit distinguished base SE and CS cars.[78] Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, upgradeable to the four-speed automatic.[79] Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM radio, centre console storage compartment, remote fuel filler release, intermittent windscreen wipers, digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver's seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X's front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric antenna, plus central locking, variable intermittent wipers and center rear arm rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage graphic equalizer for the audio system.[66][80] A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning.[66][81] In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim.[66][82] Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift,[46] the 2.0-liter 3S-FC engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8.[83] The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights.[83] In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected 3S-FE version standard upon the carbureted engine's deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi.[83][84] Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter "T".[83] With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this.[85] Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991.[83] Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene.[83] Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December.[86][87] The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an "average" (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.[88] Camry Executive sedan (Australia; pre-facelift) Camry Lumière sedan (Japan; facelift) Camry LE V6 sedan (US; facelift) Camry Spirit wagon (Australia; first facelift) Camry CSi Limited sedan (Australia; second facelift) Holden Apollo (JK, JL) Holden Apollo (JK) SLE sedanHolden Apollo (JL) SLX sedan Holden Apollo (JK) SL sedanHolden Apollo (JL) GS sedan The Holden Apollo, a rebadged variant to the Toyota Camry, retailed in Australia alongside the facelifted Camry V20 series from August 1989.[89][90] Production had started in July.[76] This model sharing occurred due to the United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI) joint venture between Toyota Australia and General Motors-Holden's starting in 1987 that resulted in model sharing between both automakers from August 1989.[91][92] Known as the JK series, the Apollo differentiated itself by way of a redesigned grille, rehashed tail lamps and other minor trim items.[92] This rebranding scheme was the result of the Button car plan, introduced in May 1984 to rationalise and make the Australian automotive industry more competitive on a global scale by means of reducing import tariffs.[93] Offered in sedan and wagon guises, Apollo replaced the Camira.[90] Powertrains were verbatim of the Camry, with the 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine.[90][94] An SLX option pack, known as the Executive was also available.[95] The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass.[96] SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, as opposed to the SL model's steel wheels with centre caps.[97] The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission.[95] SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps.[96][98] As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.[84] In August 1991, there was a small Apollo facelift, given the designation JL, with an altered model range.[89][99] The SL and SLX continued, with the SLE now available only as a sedan. The Executive pack was now no longer offered, and a sports version, dubbed GS was introduced in both body variants. Equipment levels mostly mirrored the previous JK, although the SLX was now similar in specification to the discontinued Executive and the GS to the JK SLE, albeit without standard automatic transmission.[100] GS specification cars also added body stripes, red highlights, a tachometer and upgraded audio.[99] Appearance-wise, the JK and JL are very similar, with the JL's grille treated with bolder chrome highlighting and slightly altered tail lamps on sedans.[101] The XV10 Camry-based JM Apollo replaced the JL in March 1993.[89] Powertrains (V20) Model Drive Fuel Engine Power Torque Transmission SV20 FWD Gasoline 1.8 L I4 (1S-i) 63 kW (85 PS) (JP)64 kW (86 hp) (AU) 142 N⋅m (105 lb⋅ft) (JP)145 N⋅m (107 lb⋅ft) (AU) 5-speed manual4-speed automatic (A140E) SV22 1.8 L I4 (4S-Fi) 77 kW (105 PS) (JP) 149 N⋅m (110 lb⋅ft) (JP) 5-speed manual4-speed automatic (A140E) 2.0 L I4 (3S-FC) 82 kW (110 hp) (AU) 166 N⋅m (122 lb⋅ft) (AU) 5-speed manual4-speed automatic (A140E) SV21 2.0 L I4 (3S-GE) 103 kW (140 PS) (JP) 172 N⋅m (127 lb⋅ft) (JP) 5-speed manual4-speed automatic (A140E) 2.0 L I4 (3S-FE) 88 kW (120 PS) (JP)88 kW (118 hp) (AU)86 kW (115 hp) (NA) 169 N⋅m (125 lb⋅ft) (JP)171 N⋅m (126 lb⋅ft) (AU) 5-speed manual (S51, S53)4-speed automatic (A140E) SV25 4WD 5-speed manual (E56F5)4-speed automatic (A540H) VZV20 FWD 2.0 L V6 (1VZ-FE) 103 kW (140 PS) (JP) 174 N⋅m (128 lb⋅ft) (JP) 5-speed manual (E53)4-speed automatic (A540E) VZV21 2.5 L V6 (2VZ-FE) 117 kW (157 hp) (AU)114 kW (153 hp) (NA) 215 N⋅m (159 lb⋅ft) (AU) 5-speed manual (E52)4-speed automatic (A540E) CV20 Diesel 2.0 L I4-T (2C-T) 60 kW (82 PS) (JP) 177 N⋅m (131 lb⋅ft) (JP) 5-speed manual (S50)4-speed automatic (A140L) V30 (1990–1994)[edit] V30OverviewAlso calledToyota VistaProductionJuly 1990 – June 1994AssemblyJapan: Toyota, Aichi (Tsutsumi plant)DesignerOsamu Shikado (1988)[102]Body and chassisBody style4-door sedan4-door hardtop sedanLayoutTransverse front-engine, front-wheel-driveTransverse front-engine, four-wheel-driveRelatedToyota Camry (XV10)Toyota Windom (XV10)Lexus ES 300 (XV10)PowertrainEngine1.8 L I4 gasoline (4S-FE)2.0 L I4 gasoline (3S-FE)2.0 L I4 gasoline (3S-GE)2.0 L V6 gasoline (1VZ-FE)2.5 L V6 gasoline (4VZ-FE)2.0 L I4-T diesel (2C-T)Transmission5-speed manual4-speed automaticDimensionsWheelbase2,600 mm (102.4 in)Length4,600 mm (181.1 in) (sedan)4,630–4,670 mm (182.3–183.9 in) (hardtop)Width1,695 mm (66.7 in)Height1,395 mm (54.9 in) (sedan)1,380 mm (54.3 in) (hardtop)Curb weight1,180–1,360 kg (2,600–3,000 lb) Introduced exclusively to Japan in July 1990, the Camry V30 carried forward the four-door sedan and a differently styled hardtop sedan.[103] Like before, either shape could be had in a Vista branded variety with revised styling.[103] Both bodies would also form the basis of enlarged wide-body XV10 versions from September 1991, aimed primarily at international markets.[104][105] The V30 remained smaller than the XV10 to offer buyers a vehicle within the "five-number" registration category concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement for Japanese vehicle size regulations.[106] The rules required a body width under 1.7 m (5.6 ft), length under 4.7 m (15.4 ft), and engines at or below 2,000 cc.[107] Sedans in the wide-body format would sell overseas as the Camry XV10—identical to the smaller V30 in most respects except for the front- and rear-end styling grafted to an otherwise unchanged body and interior.[108] Hardtop sedans would engender the luxury Lexus ES 300 (XV10), which again would couple the existing side profile with rehashed front, rear, and interior designs.[109] The export-oriented ES 300 would sell as the Toyota Windom in Japan.[110] Dimensions grew slightly with sedan body length extended to 4,600 mm (181.1 in), and for the Vista and Camry hardtops to 4,630 and 4,370 mm (182.3 and 172.0 in), respectively.[111][112] Penned by Osamu Shikado,[113] the V30's design is much rounder when compared to the V20 series.[103] Sedans purge the V20's six-window greenhouse for a four-part setup with integrated window sashes.[111] Up front, the sedan's curved headlamps converge with a slimline grille insert; hardtops get a thinner front assembly with narrower lights, and the C-pillar is raked more sharply.[103] Base cars gain full body-colour coding of peripheral exterior components.[111] The four-wheel strut/coil suspension carried over from the V20, although as option on high-end front-drive trims, Toyota added a wheel-stroke-sensitive Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension (TEMS) and speed sensitive four-wheel steering.[114] The available powerplants were three twin-cam inline-four engines—the 1.8-liter 4S-FE, plus the 3S-FE and higher-performance 3S-GE 2.0-liter units.[114] Toyota also made available the 2.0-liter 2C-T turbo-diesel inline-four, and for the flagship Camry Prominent only, the 2.0-liter 1VZ-FE gasoline V6.[114] An updated model appeared in July 1992.[111] The scope of changes ranged from a new, larger grille and a revised air conditioning unit. At the same time the ZX touring package appeared in place of GT, which Toyota discontinued in conjunction with its 3S-GE.[111] Camry sedan (pre-facelift) Camry sedan (facelift) Camry sedan (facelift) Vista hardtop V40 (1994–1998)[edit] V40OverviewAlso calledToyota Vista (V40)ProductionJuly 1994–1998 (JDM)AssemblyJapan: Toyota, Aichi (Tsutsumi plant)Body and chassisBody style4-door sedan4-door hardtop sedan (Vista only)LayoutTransverse front-engine, front-wheel-driveTransverse front-engine, four-wheel-drivePowertrainEngine1.8 L I4 gasoline 4S-FE2.0 L I4 gasoline 3S-FE2.2 L I4-T diesel 3C-TDimensionsWheelbase2,650 mm (104.3 in)Length4,625 mm (182.1 in)Width1,695 mm (66.7 in)Height1,410–1,435 mm (55.5–56.5 in) The Camry V40 appeared in July 1994 exclusively for the Japanese market. The Toyota Vista twin continued on, although the Camry Prominent hardtop was no longer offered; only the Vista was available as a hardtop. As before in previous generations, the Camry was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, while the Vista was only available at Toyota Vista Store locations. V40 continued to be built around the 4,700 mm (185.0 in) x 1,700 mm (66.9 in) length-width bracket, legacy of a Japanese taxation law. The car is 15 mm (0.6 in) taller[115] than its predecessor.[114] Engines for the V40 were a 1.8-liter (4S-FE type) and 2.0-liter (3S-FE type), and a 2.2-liter turbodiesel (3C-T type). At launch only the 2.0-liter model was available in all-wheel drive mode, although afterwards the 2.2-liter turbodiesel could be optioned with this system. Toyota updated the V40 in June 1996. In the update anti-lock brakes and dual air bags became standard equipment. After 1998, the Japanese market Camry and international Camry became in-line with each other, with the Vista taking over the V30 and V40 Camry roles.

The interior features a center instrument panel/navigation display. Vista V50 is significant because it's one of the first fruits of Toyota's company-wide platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in December 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first mass-production, FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and rethink of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades the rear MacPherson struts for a torsion beam axle setup. A double-wishbone setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the intake manifold is in front, improving space efficiency. Production for the Vista ended in September 2003, as Toyota prepared to rename the Vista dealers as the Netz dealership network. The move to simplify Toyota's dealership came in light of the pending Lexus launch in Japan, planned for August 2005. In April 2005 the process was complete and all Vista dealers became Netz dealers. In October 2003, the Vista was replaced by the second generation Avensis. Vista sedan (pre-facelift) Vista sedan (facelift) Vista Ardeo wagon (facelift) Wide-body[edit] XV10 (1991–1996)[edit] XV10Pre-facelift Camry sedan (Australia)OverviewAlso calledHolden ApolloToyota ScepterToyota VientaProduction1991–19961992–1997 (Australia)Model years1992–1996DesignerOsamu Shikado (1988)Body and chassisBody style2-door coupé4-door sedan5-door station wagon Main article: Toyota Camry (XV10) Toyota replaced the compact V20 Camry with the Japanese market-only V30 series in 1990. However, international markets such as Australia and North America received a widened version of the V30, known as the XV10 series. While marginally larger than the V20, the V30 had to comply with Japanese dimension regulations, which restricted the car's width to 1,700 mm (67 in) and length to 4,700 mm (190 in) for a lower tax obligation. Particularly in the United States, this narrower model was seen as compromised, thus limiting its sales potential.[116] As a result, the "wide-body" mid-size Camry (XV10) released to North America in 1991 was developed from early 1988 and the final design frozen later that year.[117] It was with the XV10 that Toyota upgraded the Camry's status to its second "world car" after the Corolla, with exports starting from Australia to Southeast Asia.[105] Japan also received the wider XV10 model, although it was sold under the Toyota Scepter name there.[118][119] Toyota chose the name "Scepter" as a reference to the Camry/Crown naming tradition, as a "scepter" is a symbolic ornamental staff held by a ruling monarch, a prominent item of royal regalia. A notable point of the "Wide body" SXV10 Camry is the influence of engineering developed from the launch of Lexus and the LS400, which came to market just a few years prior to its public debut. The kinship to Lexus models in engineering standards (such as CMM and GD&T development standards) and tolerances on the SXV10 is often perceived to be closer than any prior or latter iterations of the Camry. In an interview with Automotive News, Chris Hostetter, group vice president for Toyota NA, admitted that the 1992 Camry was considered by many company insiders to be more of a "Lexus product" than most Toyota badge cars, going on to mention that it borrowed technologies such as hydraulically powered cooling fans directly developed from the ES300.[120] However, the Lexus standards of the SXV10 created a division in product development philosophies in the company. Also according to Automotive News, some company insiders considered it too upscale for its price point and the market segment it was set to compete within (mid-sized, mid-segment). It was Robert McCurry in conjunction with Dave Illingworth and Jim Press, who, with great initial opposition from the Japanese executives, convinced the Japanese company that the 1992 Camry be re-designed, enlarged, and shaped to resemble a scaled-down LS400 with a more affordable FWD format, to help establish the reputation of Lexus, which at the time was still in its infancy and lacked brand heritage. The intensive platform and component sharing with the 1992 ES300 allowed Toyota to leverage costs better to allow the SXV10 Camry's high level of specification at a reasonable price. The 1992 Camry also took more resemblance to the LS400 in the sloped roofline, wide C pillar and framed windows, where as the ES300 featured a hardtop design with an upgraded/stiffened suspension. However, the LS400 and the SXV10 Camry featured no sharing of powertrain layout nor design. Many insiders of Toyota argued even after critical acclaim that the SXV10 Camry overlapped too greatly with Lexus, even though Chris Hostetter, current vice president of advanced technology research at Toyota, believed the model had to be developed to develop buyers who would become interested in Lexus.[121][122] This division as well as cost-cutting led to the Camry and Lexus line to become more distinctive, as the Camry became a more economical, affordable, spacious sedan typical of the segment. The smaller V30 Camry varied in other areas besides the size. Although the underpinnings, doors and fenders, and overall basic design cues were common between the two cars, the smaller Camry sported harder, more angular front- and rear-end styling treatment, with the wide-body model presenting a more curvaceous silhouette. This was a departure from the V20 generation Camry which, although had many more rounded panels than the V10 series, was nevertheless generally slab-sided in shape. A two-door Camry coupé was added to compete with the Honda Accord coupé. However, the Camry Coupé was never popular and was dropped in 1996. A two-door Camry would not be reintroduced until 1999, with the Toyota Camry Solara. The Japanese V30 model was replaced by the Camry V40 in 1994, however, this was also a Japan-only model. International markets instead retained the wider XV10 until it was replaced by the XV20 in 1996. The V40 and XV20 models were sold alongside one another in the Japanese market until 1998. At this time, the Vista V50 took the place of the V40, ending the period of separate Camrys for the Japanese and international markets. The XV10, at its most basic level, offered a 2.2-liter 5S-FE four-cylinder engine, up from 2.0 liters in the V20 and V30 Camrys. This unit produced 97 kW (130 hp) of power and 197 N⋅m (145 lb⋅ft) of torque, although the exact figures varied slightly depending on the market. Power and displacement increases were also received for the V6 engine. The 3.0-liter 3VZ-FE unit was rated at 138 kW (185 hp) and 264 N⋅m (195 lb⋅ft). An all-new aluminium 1MZ-FE V6 debuted in North American models from 1993 for the 1994 model year, with other markets retaining the 3VZ-FE V6. Power and torque rose to 140 kW (190 hp) and 275 N⋅m (203 lb⋅ft), respectively.[123] In Australia, the V6 engine Camry was badged "Camry Vienta" when launched in 1993, later becoming the Toyota Vienta in 1995.[124] In South Africa, the XV10 Camry was manufactured by Toyota SA in Durban from 1992 to 2001,[125] offering both the 2.2-liter and 3.0-liter engines, as well as a 2.0-liter engine derived from the Celica. Only a sedan configuration was available. These were also marketed and sold into Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. A variant of the UK market V6 model - detuned to run on 91 rather than 95 octane unleaded petrol - was launched in New Zealand in 1991. These Japanese-built models were replaced with an Australian-made line, with unique New Zealand specification, in 1993 at which point the 2.2-liter I4 was offered as well.

Design work was frozen in early 1994 and later launched in the United States in September 1996 and Japan in December 1996. It continued as a sedan and station wagon (called the Camry Gracia in Japan), though the latter model was not sold in the United States. This generation was launched in the US for the 1997 model year. In August 1999 for the 2000 model year, the sedan models received a mid-model upgrade to the front and rear fascias, but remained otherwise similar to the 1997 to 1999 models. In the United States, the Camry SE was dropped and the base model was renamed the CE for the 1997 model year. Both the LE and the XLE trims were carried over from the previous series. All trim levels were available with either the 2.2-liter I4 or the 3.0-liter V6 engine except the Solara SLE, which was only available with the V6. TRD offered a supercharger kit for 1997 through to 2000 V6 models raising power to 247 hp (184 kW) and 242 lb⋅ft (328 N⋅m) of torque. A coupe was added in 1999, and then a convertible form in 2000. In contrast to the coupe from the XV10 generation Camrys, the new two-door cars were given a separate nameplate Camry Solara, or simply Solara. They were also a significant styling departure from the sedan. The Solara was available in SE and SLE trims, corresponding roughly to the sedan's LE and XLE trims. Power was increased slightly to 133 hp (99 kW) SAE for the 5S-FE 2.2 L I4 and 192 hp (143 kW) SAE for the 1MZ-FE V6. Manual transmissions (model: S51) were only available on the CE trim level, LE V6, and any Solara model. Camrys and Solaras equipped with the 5S-FE 4 cylinder engine and appropriate trim package received the S51 manual transmission, while those equipped with the 1MZ-FE 6 cylinder engine received the E153 manual transmission.[126] Camry sedan (pre-facelift) Camry sedan (facelift) Camry sedan (facelift) XV30 (2001–2006)[edit] XV30Pre-facelift Camry (regular)OverviewAlso calledDaihatsu Altis (Japan)Production2001–20062002–2006 (Australia)Model years2002–2006Body and chassisBody style4-door sedanPlatformToyota K platformToyota modular platform (Australia) Main article: Toyota Camry (XV30) Regular Released in September 2001 for the 2002 model year,[127] Toyota released the Camry XV30 series as a larger sedan,[128] but without a station wagon for the first time.[129] The wagon's demise occurred due to its sales erosion to minivans and crossover SUVs. Toyota redesigned this series from the ground up for the first time since the V30 and XV10.[130] Through efficiency gains such as increased computerization, and by having the XV30 ride on the K platform introduced with the Toyota Highlander (XU20) of 2000, Toyota expedited the XV30 production development stage to 26 months, down from 36 months with the XV20.[130] As a consequence, Toyota claimed the XV30 to have cost 30 percent less to design and develop than its predecessor.[131] XV30 also had increased parts content over the XV20, but did not cost any more to manufacture.[131] Until the 2003 model year, the Camry Solara remained on the XV20 series chassis, and received only minor styling upgrades to the front and rear ends. However, the Solara did receive the same 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE I4 engine that was available on the Camry sedan. The US received three engine options, a 115 kW (154 hp) 2.4-liter inline-four, a 142 kW (190 hp) 3.0-liter V6, and a 157 kW (210 hp) 3.3-liter version of the same. The 3.3-liter was only available for the Camry's sportier "SE" model.

The regular Camry, fitted with four-cylinder engines sold alongside the V6-engined prestige Camry in Oceania and the Middle East as the Toyota Aurion. Between 2006 and 2010, the regular Camry was also rebadged as the Daihatsu Altis model, which sold alongside the Camry in Japan. The Daihatsu differed only in badging, with no cosmetic changes. The XV40 Camry was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show alongside a hybrid version and went on sale in March 2006 for the 2007 model year. Power comes from a choice of four and six-cylinder engines. The 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE I4 engine was carried over and produced 158 hp (118 kW). It came with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 in contrast came with a new six-speed automatic and produced 268 hp (200 kW).[132] The Camry was facelifted in 2009 for the 2010 model year with a redesigned fascia, taillights, and an all-new 2.5-liter 2AR-FE four-cylinder engine with a new six-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5-liter engine produces 169 hp (126 kW) for the base, LE, XLE models, and 179 hp (133 kW) for the SE. Power locks, stability control, traction control and tires (205–225 mm or 8.1–8.9 in) were also made standard for 2010.[133] A six speed manual transmission was available on the base model.[134] The XV40 series Camry is the first in which the Camry has been available as a gasoline/electric hybrid. The Camry Hybrid uses Toyota's second-generation Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) and a 2AZ-FXE four-cylinder with 110 kW (148 hp) in conjunction with a 30 kW (40 hp) electric motor for a combined output of 140 kW (188 hp).[135] Camry (pre-facelift) Camry (facelift) Camry (facelift) Camry Hybrid (facelift) Prestige Main article: Toyota Aurion (XV40) The Asian market Camry features different front and rear styling, plus a revised interior. In Asia, the Camry occupied a higher end of the market, priced just below entry-level German luxury models.[136] The Asian Camry lineup includes a 3.5-liter V6 model and is sold as the Toyota Aurion (XV40) in Australia, competing against large Australian sedans like the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore.

The US Camry carried over three different engine choices from the previous model. Starting with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid model rated at 149 kW (200 hp), a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine rated at 133 kW (178 hp) and 230 N⋅m (170 lb⋅ft), and a 3.5-liter V6 rated at 200 kW (268 hp) and 336 N⋅m (248 lb⋅ft). Power output has been increased mostly by switching to electro-hydraulic power steering. The trim levels include the L, LE, SE, XLE, SE V6, XLE V6, Hybrid LE, Hybrid XLE and for 2014 a Hybrid SE model. All models except for the hybrids are standard with six-speed automatic transmissions. No manual transmissions are offered. Hybrids are equipped with an eCVT transmission. The SE model gets paddle shifters, and a stiffer suspension. The new model has increased fuel economy due to lighter weight, a sleeker body, and low rolling-resistance tires. A major facelift released to North America in April 2014 for the 2015 model year updated most of the exterior panels.[138] The US-built Toyota Camry took the top spot in 2015 and 2016 as the most American-Made car with over 75 percent of its parts and manufacturing coming from the United States.[139] Camry Hybrid (pre-facelift) Camry Atara/SE (pre-facelift) Camry (pre-facelift) Camry (facelift) Camry Hybrid (facelift) Camry (facelift) Prestige In this generation, the Camry line-up for the Japanese domestic market was reduced to being just a single variant (hybrid only). The Japanese market will now share the same Camry model as the Asian market "prestige" Camry—a design also adopted by the Toyota Aurion (XV50), albeit with minor visual changes. The Brazilian market also carries the Prestige variant instead of the one sold in North America (only in the 3.5L V6 configuration). Prior to the XV50, the Japanese and Brazilian markets wide-body Camry were similar to the US models.[140][141] The "prestige" Camry was discontinued in Southeast Asia and India in late 2018, but continued to be sold in Vietnam until April 2019.

North American production started in June 2017 and sales began in late July 2017.[149] It is built on GA-K platform.[145] Due to the need to equip Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky with new equipment for Toyota New Global Architecture, a small portion of the initial North American production was sourced from the Tsutsumi plant in Japan. For the Australian market, the XV70 was imported from Japan. This followed the termination of 55 years of Toyota production in Australia, including the closure of the Camry plant at Altona, Victoria.[150] The XV70 Camry was launched in Thailand on 29 October 2018.[151] It was also revealed for the Malaysian market on 1 November 2018[152] and launched on 22 November 2018 at the Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show.[153] In the Philippines, it was launched on 10 December 2018.[154][155] It was also launched in Indonesia on 8 January 2019,[156][157][158] in Singapore on 10 January 2019 at the Singapore Motorshow,[159][160] in India and Brunei on 18 January 2019[161][162][163] and in Vietnam on 23 April 2019.[164] It has been available in Western Europe since April 2019, replacing the Avensis.[165] Each trim level would feature a different front fascia to differentiate it from other Camry models.[166] Trim levels for the North American Camry include L, LE, SE, XLE, XSE, XLE V6 and XSE V6, as well as LE, SE and XLE versions of the Camry Hybrid.[167] In 2019, for the 2020 model year, the TRD Camry trim level was introduced. It was based on the SE trim and only available with a V6; it comes with sportier suspension, sports exhaust, body kit, trunk spoiler, special TRD-badged interior and red seat belts.[168] In 2020, for the 2021 model year, the L was dropped and the XSE Hybrid was added.[169] This 2021 changes includes refreshed front lower fascia and the touchscreen display now uses a tablet-style arrangement. The TSS-P for 2021 model year, now replaced by newer TSS 2.5. It includes upgrades to systems such as the pedestrian-detection and adaptive cruise control functions. Trim levels for the Australian Camry include Ascent, Ascent Sport, SX and SL, as well as Ascent, Ascent Sport and SL versions of the Camry Hybrid.[170] Trim levels for the Thai market Camry include 2.0 G, 2.5 G, 2.5 HV and 2.5 HV Premium,[151] while the Malaysian Camry is only available in 2.5 V trim.[152][153] Trim levels for the Philippine Camry include 2.5 G and 2.5 V.[154][155] Trim levels for the Indonesian Camry include 2.5 G and 2.5 V, as well as the Camry Hybrid.[156][157][158] Trim levels for the Vietnamese Camry include 2.0 G and 2.5 Q.[164] In Singapore, the Camry is offered in 2.0-litre and 2.5-litre engine options.[159][160] Only the Camry Hybrid is offered in India.[161][162] In Brunei, the Camry is only offered in 2.5-litre engine option.[163] For the Chinese market, trim levels consist of 2.0 G, 2.0 E, 2.0 S, 2.5 G, 2.5 Q, 2.5 S, 2.5 HG and 2.5 HQ. Engine choice consisted of the 6AR-FSE, the A25A and the A25B. The 6AR-FSE engine was replaced for the 2019 model year with the 2 litre M20A-FKS, which also powers the Toyota Corolla (E210). Gearbox choices are a 6-speed automatic for 2.0-litre models (6AR-FSE only), an 8-speed automatic for the 2.5G, Q and S and the CVT gearbox for the 2.0 E, 2.0 G, 2.0 S, 2.5HG and 2.5HQ.[171] In Germany, the Camry Hybrid is offered in Business Edition and Executive trim levels. In the United Kingdom, the Camry Hybrid is offered in Design and Excel trim levels. Engine choices include a base 2.5 L inline four-cylinder (I4) that now produces 151 kW (203 hp) in base form (155 kW (208 hp) when equipped with the optional quad exhaust), the same 2.5 L inline four-cylinder (I4) engine with an electric motor (Hybrid) that produces 155 kW (208 hp), or the top-of-the-line 3.5 L V6 that produces 224 kW (301 hp).[172] In some markets the old 2.5 L 2AR-FE engine is carried over from the previous generation which produces 133 kW (178 hp). The only major component that is shared with the previous-generation is the Toyota emblem on the front grille and rear trunk lid.[172] The Camry would be the first Toyota vehicle to introduce the Entune 3.0 System, which, powered by Linux, would be an "Open-Source" operating system (OS), providing for developers to develop different applications that would work with the infotainment system.[173] Transmission choices include a simulated six-speed sequential shift automatic (CVT) for Hybrid models, six-speed automatic for the 2.5L 2AR-FE engine or an eight-speed automatic for the 2.5L A25A-FKS/A25A-FKB and V6 powered Camrys.[173] As with all Toyota vehicles, Toyota Safety Sense would come as standard equipment on all Camry models, bringing standard a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, a full-speed radar cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high beam assist. Optional safety features would include active blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, intelligent clearance sonar, and rear cross-traffic braking.[173] For the first time in decades, the Camry is available in the US with AWD starting with the 2020 MY.[174][175] It is available only with the 2.5L engine mated to the automatic transmission.

In the United States, except for 2001, the Camry was the best-selling passenger car from 1997 to 2016.[177][178] Despite international success, and early success in Japan, the later wide-body models have been a low-volume model in its home market. However, since the introduction of the XV50 Camry in 2011, sales of the wide-body models in Japan have resurged, thanks, in large part, to the inclusion of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system. The Camry is also a prolific seller within Australia. The Camry has profited within its medium-sized class, where it has been its best selling since 1993, beating traditional competitors including the Mazda 6, as well as contemporary ones in that of the Ford Mondeo and Skoda Octavia.[179] The Middle East, as well as Eastern Europe, each have seen the Camry sell well, with Western Europe previously having small amounts exported.[180] Country 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 Australia 30,273[181] 32,308 [182] US 52,651 93,725 128,143 151,767 186,623 225,322 255,252 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 Australia 31,621[183] 27,672[184] 25,699[185] 32,551[186] 35,859[187] 33,367[188] 31,777[189] 30,890[190] 42,031[191] 42,522[192] US 283,042 262,531 284,751 297,836 319,718 326,632 357,359 394,397 427,308 445,696 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Australia 33,334[193] 26,726[194] 30,952[195] 38,540[196] 40,356[197] 36,492[198] 30,262[199] 26,342[200] 23,067[201] 20,846[202] Canada 15,524[203] US 422,961[204] 388,512 434,145[205] 413,296 426,990[206] 431,703 448,445[207] 473,108 436,617[208] 356,824[209] 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Australia 25,014[210] 19,169[210] 27,230[211] 24,860[212] 22,044[213] 27,654 26,485 23,620 Canada 12,251 12,334[214] 14,765[215] 15,113[216] 16,805[217] 15,683[217] 14,574[218] 14,588[218] Thailand 6,847[219] 8,087[220] 5,909 [221] 4,505 [222] 4,589[citation needed] US 327,804[223] 308,510[224] 404,886[225] 408,484[226] 428,606[227] 429,355[228] 388,618 [229] 387,081 [230] 343,439[231] 336,978[232] Hybrid sales[edit] Camry Hybrid Calendar Year US 2006 31,341[233] 2007 54,477[233] 2008 46,272[233] 2009 22,887[233] 2010 14,587[233] 2011 9,241[233] 2012 45,656[233] 2013 44,448[233] 2014 39,515[233] 2015 30,640[233] 2016 22,227[233] 2017 20,985[233] 2018 22,914[232] 2019 26,043[232] References[edit] ^ Robinson, Aaron (February 2007).

This caused a swift reaction in Europe and Japan, not as quickly reflected in the US, to 'downsize' the product and make, smaller, cheaper and more fuel-efficient cars.

Soviet soldiers wearing Panamkas Soviet troops in Afghanistan The Panamanka (Russian: Панаманка) or Panamka (Russian: Панамка) were the common names for the standard tropical headgear of the Soviet Army.[1][2] Officially the M-38 Field Hat, the Panamanka was introduced on 10 March, 1938, for troops of the Red Army in the Central Asian, North Caucasian and Transcaucasian military districts and Crimea.[3] It was nicknamed Panamanka in reference to Panama hats, due to the vague physical resemblance between the two hats. The Panamanka was popularized in Western imagery of the Soviet Union during the Soviet-Afghan War in 1980s, where it was often worn with the Afghanka uniform as Afghanistan was known for its extreme hot daytime temperatures in the summer and its equally bitter cold nights in the winter months. Two versions of the Panamanka existed: The original hat was developed to keep the rays of the sun off the wearer's head and out of his eyes.[4] It was made of heavy cotton cloth and featured a set of ventilation holes, a thin leather headband, a plastic chinstrap, and the enameled metal M22 Red Star badge, on a large sew on red star, on the front.[5][6] A second version appeared with the M88 Afghanka, and more closely resembled the boonie hats used by NATO forces. It had a plastic chin strap that rested on the rim and could be set to hang down by unbuttoning one side and passing it through holes on the rim, but it was too short for use as such. The chin strap could be used to hold the sides of the rim up, this likely being its intended purpose. It also didn't feature the large sew on red star. Later production examples also feature a flat top and snaps or press-studs that allow it be buttoned up on the side similar to the Australian slouch or bush hat.[7] See also[edit] Kepka-afganka Valenki Podvorotnichok Spetsodezhda Notes[edit] ^ Soviet Uniforms & Militaria 1917 - 1991 in Colour Photographs Paperback – June 30, 2011 by Laszlo Bekesi (Author), The Crowood Press UK (June 30, 2011), rereISBN 978-1847972606 ^ Warsaw Pact Ground Forces by David Rottmman, January 22, 1987, Osprey Publishing (Elite Series) ^ World War II Soviet Armed Forces (1): 1939–41, Osprey Publishing (Men-at-Arms 464), Feb 20, 2012 by Nigel Thomas and Darko Pavlovic, ISBN 978-1849084000 ^ http://www.militarysunhelmets.com/2015/the-afghanka-hat-the-soviets-tropical-headgear ^ http://www.militarysunhelmets.com/2015/the-afghanka-hat-the-soviets-tropical-headgear ^ World War II Soviet Armed Forces (1): 1939–41, Osprey Publishing (Men-at-Arms 464), Feb 20, 2012 by Nigel Thomas and Darko Pavlovic, ISBN 978-1849084000 ^ http://www.militarysunhelmets.com/2015/the-afghanka-hat-the-soviets-tropical-headgear Sources[edit] Soviet Uniforms and Militaria 1917-1991 by Laszlo Bekesi, The Crowood Press UK (June 30, 2011), ISBN 978-1847972606 Inside the Soviet Army Today, Osprey Elite Military History Series No. 12 by Stephen J Zaloga, May 28, 1987 Russia's War in Afghanistan by David Isby, Osprey Publishing (Men-at-Arms) by David Isby (1986-06-15) This Russian military article is a stub.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Inowłódz. It lies approximately 15 kilometres (9 mi) east of Tomaszów Mazowiecki and 60 km (37 mi) south-east of the regional capital Łódź.[1] The village has a population of 795. Contents 1 History 2 Sights 3 Inowłódz in films 4 References History[edit] Inowłódz is one of the oldest towns in Poland. It was first mentioned in documents from 1145, and by then, it already had a public house, a church, a fair, and a custom house, located on the Pilica crossing. The river itself marks here the border between two historic provinces of Poland - Lesser Poland and the Land of Leczyca. Furthermore, a few kilometers to the northeast lies the province of Mazovia. In the early days of the Kingdom of Poland, the Inowłódz river crossing was an important element of an international merchant route from Torun towards the Kingdom of Hungary. The village was granted Magdeburg rights in the mid-14th century, but exact date is not known. Inowłódz quickly developed, and in the 14th and 15th centuries was an important center of brewing and grain commerce. In 1370, the town was surrounded by a defensive wall, and a castle, which was the seat of a starosta, was built. The Inowłódz stronghold was a part of the defensive system of the Kingdom of Poland. The period of prosperity ended during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655 - 1660), when Inowłódz was destroyed by Swedish soldiers. In September 1655, a skirmish between Swedes and Polish division of Stefan Czarniecki took place here. Together with the town, Swedish invaders destroyed the castle, after which the starostas had to live in a small house in the town. In the 18th century, Inowłódz became a center of industry, with iron works and lime excavation. After the Partitions of Poland, the town belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland (1815 - 1915), and following the January Uprising, lost its town charter (1870). In the late 19th century, Inowłódz became a spa, popular among residents of Łódź and Warsaw. In 1884, a spa center with guest houses and bath was opened by Bernard Birenzweig, and among the visitors was Julian Tuwim, who liked to come here for the summer vacation. The development of the Inowłódz spa ended during World War I, when the village found itself on the frontline in December 1914, and was almost completely destroyed, together with the bridge over the Pilica. In the Second Polish Republic, Inowłódz belonged to Łódź Voivodeship, and in 1939 (see Invasion of Poland), the area of the village once again saw heavy fighting, between the Wehrmacht, advancing towards Warsaw, and the Polish Prusy Army. In early 1940, the unit of Major Henryk Dobrzanski operated here, the symbolic tomb of Dobrzanski is 5 kilometers from Inowłódz. Sights[edit] The history of Roman Catholic church of Saint Giles probably dates back to the year 1082. Most likely however, the church was founded during the reign of Boleslaw Krzywousty, in the 1130s. At the same time, a fortified monastery of Benedictine nuns was built by the church. The monastery was destroyed in 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Poland. In 1520, the church of St. Michael was built, which brought about the decline of the Saint Giles church. In 1790, the ancient church was renovated, but three years later, it was ransacked by Prussian soldiers, and turned into a grain storage. The Saint Giles church was completely renovated in the Second Polish Republic, on initiative of President Ignacy Moscicki. First service took place on November 1, 1938. Inowłódz in films[edit] Inowłódz and the area of the village have for years been popular among Polish film makers. Among movies made here are: The Ashes by Andrzej Wajda (1965), Czterej pancerni i pies by Konrad Nalecki (1966–1970), Colonel Wolodyjowski by Jerzy Hoffman (1969), How I Unleashed World War II by Tadeusz Chmielewski (1969), Boleslaw Smialy by Witold Lesiewicz (1971), Hubal by Bohdan Poreba (1973), Epitafium dla Barbary Radziwillowny by Janusz Majewski (1982).

LynnKeywordsPersonal jurisdiction in internet cases in the United States, Personal jurisdiction Mavrix Photo, Inc. v. Brand Technologies, Inc., 647 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2011), is a case in American intellectual property law involving personal jurisdiction in the context of internet contacts.[1][2] This case had three significant holdings. First, the defendant, Brand Technologies, Inc., lacked sufficient contacts with California for exercise of general jurisdiction. Second, the defendant's alleged copyright infringement on its website was expressly aimed at California enough to find specific jurisdiction. Finally, the defendant's alleged copyright infringement caused harm that it recognized was likely to be suffered in California enough to find specific jurisdiction. Contents 1 Facts 2 Judicial history 3 Opinion 3.1 General jurisdiction 3.1.1 Facts 3.1.2 Court ruling 3.1.3 Conclusion 3.2 Specific jurisdiction 3.2.1 Rule 3.2.2 Conclusion 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Facts[edit] In April 2008, photographers for Mavrix Photo, Inc., a Florida corporation whose principal business was in Miami, took "candid" photos of a hip-hop pop singer Fergie and her husband during their vacation in the Bahamas. Mavrix registered copyright of those photographs for its business to exclusively license them to celebrity news outlets. However, shortly thereafter, Mavrix found that Brand Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation, had put those photographs on to its website (www.celebrity-gossip.net), allegedly without Mavrix's permission. This website has several interactive features, and was ranked as number 3,622 out of approximately 180 million websites worldwide based on traffic by Alexa.com, an Internet tracking service. It was a prominently popular website. Mavrix sued Brand Technologies, Inc. and its CEO, Brad Mandell (collectively, "Brand") in the Central District of California for infringement of copyright of its photographs. Many of the celebrities whom Mavrix took photos of worked in Southern California and Mavrix kept a Los Angeles base, employed Los Angeles-based photographers, and had a registered agent in California. In addition, it paid fees to the California Franchise Tax Board. Brand moved to dismiss the action on several grounds, including lack of personal jurisdiction. Judicial history[edit] Mavrix brought lawsuit against Brand in federal district court for the Central District of California, contending that Brand infringed Mavrix's copyright under 17 U.S.C. §§ 501, 502, and 504 by posting its copyrighted photos on its website.[1] Brand moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (see Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2)). The district court denied Mavrix's motion for jurisdictional discovery and granted Brand's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded and reversed. The Supreme Court of the United States denied the petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Jan. 17, 2012. Opinion[edit] The Ninth Circuit, firstly, stated that the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the jurisdiction is proper.[3] General jurisdiction[edit] Facts[edit] Brand (1) allowed third parties to advertise businesses, such as jobs, in California on its website; (2) sells, or allows a third-party vendors to sell, tickets to California events on its website; (3) employs a California firm to design its website; (4) has business relationships with California-based national news organization, an Internet advertising agency and a wireless provider; and (5) maintained a "highly interactive" website which had features of commenting, receiving email newsletters, voting in polls and uploading user-generated content. Court ruling[edit] To find general jurisdiction over Brand, the Ninth Circuit pointed out that the supreme court and itself have denied the exercise of general jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant when there were no substantial, continuous, or systematic contacts in the alleged jurisdiction.[4] Conclusion[edit] Applying the rule above, the court concluded that those contacts did not satisfy the requisite showing for general jurisdiction. Firstly, the court found that Brand was not registered to do business in CA, had no registered agent and no burden for state taxes. Secondly, the court stated, regarding (1) the advertisement that nonresident defendant's advertisement is influential only when it markets its own product by targeting forum residents but not when just other entities use the defendant's publication to promote their own businesses as in this case. With regard to (2) ticket sales, the court pointed out that they were third parties' business and insufficient to recognize the jurisdiction. Relating to (3) the employment of California web-design firm, the court decided it as "fortuitous circumstance" which is insufficient to premise jurisdiction because the firm formed California branch after its establishment of celebrity-gossip website. Also, the court stated (5) business relationship with California company was not sufficient, citing that "engaging in commerce with residents of the forum state is not in and of itself the kind of activity that approximates physical presence within the state's borders."[5] And finally, regarding (6) interactive website, the court deemed it as standard attributes of many website. It said that if it permit general jurisdiction based on access to such website, it would lead to the result inconsistent with constitutional requirement of "the continuous corporate operation within a state" be "so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against" the non-resident defendant. Specific jurisdiction[edit] Rule[edit] First, the court declared three-pronged test, so called "minimum contact" test that "(1) The non-resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or consummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction ... must be reasonable."[6] The court stated that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof of (1) and (2),[7] and if the plaintiff did so, the defendant bears the shifted burden of proof regarding (3) to tell the jurisdiction would be unreasonable.[8] The court also pointed out the Calder "effects" test[a] The first prong of the specific jurisdiction test refers to both purposeful direction and purposeful availment. In cases involving tortious conduct, the court most often employs a purposeful direction analysis. In tort cases, the court typically inquires whether a defendant purposefully directs his activities at the forum state, applying an "effects" test that focuses on the forum in which the defendant's actions were felt, whether or not the actions themselves occurred within the forum.[9] Regarding the first prong that it requires (a) an intentionally committed act, (b) expressly aimed act at the forum state, (c) causing harm that the defendant recognized it is likely to be suffered in the forum state.[10][11] ^ The Calder "effects" test is a test for personal jurisdiction described in Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984). Conclusion[edit] The court affirmed specific jurisdiction under the first prong test using the effects test. Regarding the effects test (a), the court found that Brand obviously intentionally posted the assertedly copyright-infringing photos. Also, regarding (b), because Brand used Mavrix’s photos to exploit the California market for its commercial purpose, the court recognized Brand's activity as "expressly aimed" for its website with national popularity and scope appealing to and profiting from an audience in a particular state. Furthermore, the court stated that because the photos' value was foreseeably based on the significant number of Californians that would have bought the publication of the photos, Brands' conduct of posting those photos resulted in the harm of such California-based value.

Mitsubishi Triton2017 Mitsubishi TritonOverviewManufacturerMitsubishi MotorsProduction1978–presentBody and chassisClassCompact pickup truckLayoutFront-engine, rear-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive The Mitsubishi Triton is a compact pickup truck produced by Mitsubishi Motors. In Japan it was originally known as the Mitsubishi Forte[1] and from 1991 as the Strada. In the United States Chrysler Corporation sold captive imports as the Dodge Ram 50 and Plymouth Arrow truck, and Mitsubishi marketed it as the Mitsubishi Mighty Max until 1996. For most export markets the name L200 is used[2][3][4] though it also been known as the Rodeo,[5] Colt,[6] Storm, Magnum, L200 Strakar (badge used in Portugal since 1999, Strakar is a portmanteau of Strada and Dakar),[7] and others. Cumulative sales of the first three generations exceeded 2.8 million units around the world.[8] Currently the pickup truck is sold in every available Mitsubishi market except the United States, Canada, Japan, India and China. In Japan, it was previously sold at a specific retail chain called Car Plaza. In 2015, Fiat Professional launched a rebadged version as the Fiat Fullback. In 2016, Ram Trucks launched a rebadged version as the Ram 1200 for the Middle East market. The Dodge Dakota-based Mitsubishi Raider is unrelated to the Mitsubishi Triton.

In Japan the Forte was originally sold with the 92 PS (68 kW) 1.6-liter 4G32 engine (L021P).[9] Later this was updated to the 86 PS (63 kW) 1.6-liter G32B engine with two-wheel drive (LO25) or with four-wheel drive coupled to the 2.0-liter Sirius G63B with 110 PS (81 kW) (L026). Offered in basic Deluxe trim, the larger-engined version was also available in leisure-oriented Custom trim.[10] The Custom also has a smoother and less utilitarian bed, without provisions for fitting a canvas top and with fewer hardpoints for strapping down loads. 1978 Mitsubishi L200 1979–1980 Chrysler D-50 (Australia) 1984 Mitsubishi L200 Express 2.3 diesel 4WD utility (Australia) 1984–1986 Mitsubishi L200 Express (MD) 4WD 2-door cab chassis (Australia) 1983 Dodge Ram 50 In export versions, the 2.0-liter gasoline version had 93 hp (69 kW), while a larger 2.6-liter unit offered 105 hp (78 kW). Also popular in many markets, was a 67 PS (49 kW) 2.3-liter diesel engine. The 73 PS (54 kW) 1.6-liter Saturn engine rounded out the lineup in many countries.[11] A naked cab and chassis version was also available in some markets. Mechanical features included recirculating ball steering and front disc brakes, rear-wheel drive, and front suspension with coil springs.[12][13] Four-wheel drive (4WD) was added in 1981,[14] featuring torsion bar suspension up front.[13] The rear suspension for both comprised leaf springs with bias-mounted shock absorbers.[12][13] The 4WD system incorporated an extra lever located alongside the main four-speed shifter.[14] This provided three positions; 2WD in high-range, 4WD in high-range, and 4WD in low-range. In low-range, the vehicle travels at half road speed for any given engine rpm.[14] The transfer case is chain-driven to the front wheels, making it lighter, quieter, and easier to shift than the more common gear type.[14] As such, the driver can shift between 2WD and 4WD in high-range without using the clutch, with the activation of low-range requiring the vehicle to be stopped.[14] A warning lamp would light when the 4WD was engaged.[14] Chrysler variants[edit] The Dodge Ram 50 (called the Dodge D-50 for 1979 and 1980) was a badge-engineered version sold by the Chrysler Corporation from 1979 on. The label lasted until 1994, through two generations. Plymouth also received a version of the vehicle known as the Plymouth Arrow Truck, sold from 1979 to 1982. This was Chrysler's belated answer to the Ford Courier from Mazda and the Chevrolet LUV by Isuzu (both of which had been introduced in 1972). Mitsubishi itself imported it as the Mitsubishi Mighty Max when it began selling directly in the US from 1982, at which point the Plymouth ceased to be available. The Dodge version had quad rectangular headlights beginning with the 1983 facelift, while Mitsubishis and earlier Dodges had single units in North America. In the rest of the world, importers could choose between single or double rectangular units, as well as twin round headlights.[15] The twin round units were the original fitment for the Japanese domestic market. Four-wheel drive was added for 1982. This created the Power Ram 50 in the United States, as in Dodge's nomenclature the "Power Ram" name was used for four wheel drive models. A turbo diesel engine was available in US models between 1983 and 1985. The 1983 turbodiesel was fitted with a TC05 non-wastegated turbo and produced 80 hp (60 kW) and 125 lb⋅ft (169 N⋅m) torque. The 1984–1985 turbodiesels were fitted with a TD04 wastegated turbo which resulted in 86 hp (64 kW) and 134 lb⋅ft (182 N⋅m) torque. Chrysler Australia launched the first generation in April 1979 as the MA series Chrysler D-50.[12] Initially, two pickup versions were sold, the Commercial with the 1.6-liter Saturn (4G32) engine and the higher specification Recreational with the 2.0-liter Astron (4G52) engine.[12] Both Commercials and Recreationals received a floor-shifted 4-speed manual, with a taller axle ratio for the Recreational.[16] Commercials were specified with heavy duty suspension rated for 1,000-kilogram (2,200 lb) payloads; the Recreational version carries a 500-kilogram (1,100 lb) load.[12] The reason for the halved payload was due to the sedan-type suspension of softer springs and more supple shock absorbers.[16] The Recreational model also featured radial ply tires, electronic ignition, bucket seats, pile carpet, radio, floor console, sports steering wheel and an adjustable steering column as standard.[12] An optional sports stripe package was also available.[12] Options included a weather-tight, fibreglass canopy with foam rubber mattress.[16] This was manufactured by Challenge Industries and incorporated sliding side windows.[14] Later in 1979, a cab chassis body variant of the Commercial was released.[17][16] In March 1980, the D-50 was renamed Chrysler L200 Express to form linkage with the newly released L300 Express vans.[17] In October 1980, the Chrysler labelling made way for Mitsubishi badges following the establishment of Mitsubishi Motors Australia from Chrysler Australia's old operations.[18] In June 1981, Mitsubishi released 4WD versions of the pickup and cab chassis, both with the 2.0-liter motor.[19] Free-wheeling hubs to reduce noise and fuel use in 2WD mode were optional.[14] In late 1981, the 2.0-liter with five-speed manual was made optional for the 2WD one-tonne suspension models.[20] Second generation (K00/K10/K20/K30; 1986)[edit] Second generation (K00/K10/K20/K30)OverviewAlso calledDodge Ram 50 (1987–1994)Mitsubishi Triton (Australia)Mitsubishi Cyclone (Thailand)Mitsubishi Colt (South Africa)Mitsubishi L200Mitsubishi Mighty MaxMitsubishi StradaProduction1986–1996AssemblyJapan: Okazaki, Aichi (Nagoya plant)Philippines: CaintaBrazil: CatalãoPortugal: Povos, Vila Franca de XiraThailandBody and chassisBody style2-door pickup4-door pickupPowertrainEngineGasoline:2.0 L G63B I42.4 L 4G64 I42.6 L 4G54 I43.0 L 6G72 V6 (4WD only)Diesel:2.5 L 4D56 I42.5 L 4D56 turbo I4Transmission4-speed automatic5-speed manualDimensionsWheelbaseShort Bed: 2,680 mm (105.5 in)Long Bed/Ext.

In Australia, this model launched in October 1986 as the low-cost Triton. In Japan the pickups were not sold for a few years, making their return as the Strada in Japan in March 1991.[22] A facelift took place for the 1993 model year, with a new grille and new plastic bumpers comprising most of the changes.[23] It continued to be produced until 1996. Sales in the Japanese domestic market continued into the middle of 1997. The truck usually has a 68 hp (51 kW) 2.5 litre diesel or an 84 PS (62 kW) turbo diesel engine, with the turbo diesel being the only engine available in the Japanese home market. The Triton was not a spirited performer, with a four-wheel drive V6 model having a top speed of 126 km/h (78.1 mph). The second generation Mitsubishi truck was also produced in Thailand. Starting out as a fairly utilitarian truck, more comfortable versions were gradually added in most markets. In New Zealand & Australia, a small, 3.0-litre, V6 engine with 90 kW (122 PS; 121 hp) was added in early 1993. The V6 was not a well liked engine specification by consumers, as it did not tow as well or make as much torque as the diesel four-cylinder engine did, and used much more fuel than the four-cylinder.The 3.0L V6 6G72 equipped models also had a flaw in the design of the engine lifters- noisy lifters resulted in catastrophic engine failure over time.[23] The locally developed L200 Sport range, more stylish and often featuring two-tone paint, was very popular in New Zealand where the L200 was offered with five different engines.[23] North America[edit] In the US it was known as the Mitsubishi Mighty Max or the Dodge Ram 50. Petrol engines include a carburetted 92 hp (69 kW) 2.0-litre inline-four or a 2.6-litre ditto with 109 hp (81 kW). Four-wheel drive (non-LSD) was also available, as were a four-speed automatic transmission, different bed lengths, and both extended and double cab ("Macrocab") options. There was also a higher-rated one-tonner with the long bed and the short cab available. In later years the standard engine was switched to a 2.4-liter inline-four producing 116 hp (87 kW). This engine was made standard fitment on all two-wheel drive Mighty Maxes for the 1991 model year, while four-wheel drives all received the recently introduced 3-litre V6 with 143 hp (107 kW).[24] Dodge Ram 50[edit] The Ram 50 was redesigned for 1987, which was the same year Chrysler introduced the Ram 50's successor, the Dodge Dakota. Despite this, sales of the Ram 50 continued for another seven years until 1994, possibly because the Ram 50 was a compact and the Dakota was a mid-size. The difference in size and cost left a niche for the Dodge 50, and its cancellation may have been due more to a desire to show independence from Mitsubishi than because of any product overlap. The Mighty Max was taken off the US market after the 1996 model year, and its successor was not marketed in North America due to poor sales. The Ram 50 underwent facelifts and modifications corresponding to those of the L200/Mighty Max. New for the 1991 model year was a longbed version on the long wheelbase chassis but with the single cab, offering 16 in (410 mm) more loadspace than the shorter bed models.[25] Third generation (K50/K60/K70; 1996)[edit] Third generation (K50/K60/K70)OverviewAlso calledMitsubishi Colt (South Africa)Mitsubishi Triton (Australia)Mitsubishi L200Mitsubishi StormMitsubishi Strada (Japan, Thailand)Mitsubishi MagnumMitsubishi Strakar (Portugal)Production1996–2006AssemblyJapan: AichiThailand: Laem Chabang (MMTh)Brazil: CatalãoPhilippines: CaintaBody and chassisBody style2-door pickup4-door pickup5-door wagon[26]RelatedMitsubishi Pajero Sport (1st generation)PowertrainEngineGasoline:2.0 L 4G63 I42.4 L 4G64 I43.0 L 6G72 V6Diesel:2.5 L 4D56 I42.5 L 4D56 turbo I42.8 L 4M40 I42.8 L 4M40 turbo I4Transmission5-speed manual4-speed automaticDimensionsWheelbase2,950 mm (116.1 in)Length4,995 mm (196.7 in)Width1,625 mm (64.0 in)Height1,585–1,710 mm (62.4–67.3 in)Curb weight1,295–1,700 kg (2,855–3,748 lb)[27] Mitsubishi Triton GLX utility Brazilian-made 2005 Mitsubishi L200 HPE Crew Cab with Argentinian plate in Reñaca, Chile 2002 Mitsubishi L200 4Life 4WD 2.5 Rear.jpg Federal police of Brazil Mitsubishi L200 rear In 1996, a new generation model was introduced with 2.5-liter turbodiesel engines developing 103 hp (77 kW). Other engine options include two sixteen-valve fuel injected gasoline engines and a naturally aspirated diesel.[27] The previous 2.6-liter unit was replaced with a new, considerably more powerful 2.4-liter engine with 145 hp (108 kW).[27] The car participated in the Dakar Rally in 2005. Production ended in 2006. These were only built in Laem Chabang, Thailand, and were also exported to Japan between 1997 and 1999. In late 2001 the third generation pickup underwent a facelift with new headlights and other changes. An SUV model developed from the Mitsubishi Triton, called the Mitsubishi Challenger was released to Japan in 1996. In overseas markets it was also badged Montero Sport, Pajero Sport, Shogun Sport, or Nativa. Challenger shares many components and some body panels (i.e. front doors) with the Strada pickup truck and utilises the second generation Mitsubishi Pajero wheelbase. The Challenger was also produced in Thailand as the Mitsubishi Strada G-Wagon.[26] The Thai model, unlike the same vehicle manufactured elsewhere used the same front styling as the Strada pickup truck that it was based upon. It was retired from production in 2005, but the Challenger nameplate was resurrected for the second generation of the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport, launched in 2008 and which is also based on the following generation of the Mitsubishi Triton.[26] Fourth generation (KA/KB; 2005)[edit] Fourth generation (KA/KB)Mitsubishi L200OverviewAlso calledMitsubishi L200Mitsubishi Triton (Australia/Japan/Thailand)Mitsubishi Strada (Philippines)Mitsubishi Strada Triton (Indonesia)Mitsubishi SporteroMitsubishi Hunter (Israel)Mitsubishi Strakar (Portugal)Production2005–20142005–present (Brazil)AssemblyThailand: Laem Chabang (MMTh)Brazil: CatalãoSouth Africa: East London (Daimler AG)Body and chassisBody style2-door pickup4-door pickupRelatedMitsubishi Pajero Sport (KG/KH/PB)PowertrainEngineGasoline/CNG:2.4 L 4G64 I42.4 L 4G64 gasoline/CNG I43.5 L 6G74 V6Diesel:2.5 L 4D56 I42.5 L 4D56 turbo I43.2 L 4M41 turbo I4Transmission5-speed manual4-speed automatic5-speed automaticDimensionsWheelbase3,000 mm (118.1 in)Length5,040 mm (198.4 in)FBB: 4,835 mm (190.4 in)Crew Cab: 5,115 mm (201.4 in)Width1,750 mm (68.9 in)Crew Cab: 1,800 mm (70.9 in)Height1,655 mm (65.2 in)Crew Cab: 1,775 mm (69.9 in)4x4: 1,780 mm (70.1 in) Mitsubishi Triton dual cab Mitsubishi Triton GL cab chassis The fourth generation Triton was released in 2005. Designed by Akinori Nakanishi, it is built exclusively by Mitsubishi's subsidiary in Thailand and is exported to 140 global markets.[3] It is mostly known as L200 except for Japan and its subsidiary countries' markets. The car has a 2.5-liter turbodiesel engine developing 134 kW (180 hp). The base version, available in some markets such as the Dominican Republic, has a 2.5-liter normally aspirated diesel engine and the L200 off-road version called the Savana has 200 hp. In Japan, the Triton was exclusively equipped with 3.5-litre petrol engine and 4-speed automatic transmission and was sold from 2006 to 2011 - the only pick-up truck in the market at that time (excluding kei trucks). Despite its success overseas, it was a critical failure in Japan as workmen and traders preferred vans and station wagons. As a result, in August 2011 the Triton was pulled out from Mitsubishi's Japanese lineup.[28] Fifth generation (KJ/KK/KL; 2015)[edit] Fifth generation (KJ/KK/KL)Mitsubishi L200 Barbarian (Pre-facelift)OverviewAlso calledMitsubishi L200Mitsubishi TritonFiat FullbackRam 1200Mitsubishi StradaMitsubishi Strakar (Portugal)Mitsubishi Barbarian (Europe)Production2015–presentAssemblyThailand: Laem Chabang (MMTh)Brazil: CatalãoBody and chassisBody style2-door pickup4-door pickupRelatedMitsubishi Pajero Sport (KR/KS/QE)PowertrainEngineGasoline:2.4 L 4G64 I4Diesel:2.3 L 4N14 turbo I42.4 L 4N15 MIVEC turbo I42.5 L 4D56 turbo I4Transmission6-speed manual5-speed manual5-speed automatic6-speed AISIN R6AWH / V6AWH automaticDimensionsWheelbase3,000 mm (118.1 in)Length5,210 mm (205.1 in)Width1,820 mm (71.7 in)Height1,780 mm (70.1 in) Rear (Pre-facelift) Fiat Fullback RAM 1200 in Chile In 2014, Mitsubishi unveiled the all new L200 which went on sale in early 2015 (Asia Pacific) and late 2015 (Europe and the Caribbean). It is powered by a new 2.4-litre diesel engine. Since 2015, the current generation L200 shares the same underpinnings as the newly rebadged Fiat Fullback intended for the European and Middle East markets.[29] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles currently has no plans to introduce the Fullback in the North American market due to the U.S. chicken tax as well as the introduction of the Jeep Gladiator, based on the fourth-generation Jeep Wrangler SUV.[30][31][32] For the 2017 model year, Ram Trucks rebadged the Triton as the Ram 1200 for the Middle East market.[33] In addition, due to being plagued by the previous-generation Triton's critical failure in Japanese market (in contrast to its overseas success), in addition to having heavy excise duties for pickup trucks there, Mitsubishi Motors currently has no plans to bring the current Triton to their home market. Malaysia[edit] The fifth generation Mitsubishi Triton was launched in Malaysia in May 2015 as the Mitsubishi Triton being fully imported from Thailand. It was available in five variants: Triton Quest (MT), Triton MT, Triton VGT MT, Triton VGT AT and Triton VGT Adventure (AT). The VGT models came with a 2.5L variable geometry turbo engine capable of producing 178 PS and 400 Nm. The Triton MT had a 2.5L commonrail turbo engine capable of producing 136 PS and 324 Nm and the Triton Quest had a 2.5L DOHC commonrail engine with 110 PS and 200 Nm.[34][35][36][37][38] Two limited editions were made available including the: Triton Phantom Edition in January 2016[39] and the Triton Knight Edition in May 2016.[40] Both were limited to 200 units each. In September 2016, alongside of the change of engine for the VGT models to a 2.4L MIVEC VGT turbodiesel engine capable of 181 PS and 430 Nm, the Triton VGT Adventure X was also launched as the new range topper.[41] In April 2017, the Triton was updated. Changes included additional safety features for the VGT models, change in the steering wheel design and different colour choices.[42] In September 2017, the Triton VGT AT GL was launched and was positioned in between the Triton MT and Trition VGT MT.[43] In November 2017, the Triton VGT AT Premium was launched.[44] In January 2018, the Triton Athlete was launched as the new range topper.[45] In January 2019, the facelifted fifth generation Triton was launched in Malaysia with five variants: VGT (MT and AT), VGT Premium (MT and AT), Adventure X (AT only). The 4x2 Quest model remained unchanged.[46] 2019 facelift[edit] 2019 facelift Interior The Triton was refreshed for the 2019 model year at the 2018 Thailand International Motor Expo in Bangkok, Thailand. This update consists of new front fascia, which is inspired from the Pajero/Montero Sport, Eclipse Cross and Xpander,[47] new teardrop taillight design treatment as the Pajero/Montero Sport, and slight changes in the interior for some variants. This model also received a rear air circulator located at the interior roof.[48][49] Sales[edit] Calendar Year Thailand 2014 33,105[50] 2015 25,261[51] 2016 23,584[52] 2017 32,450[53] 2018 39,984[54] 2019 35,789[55] References[edit] ^ Edsall, Larry.

AN/FSQ-32The USAF planned an underground "Super Combat Center" with AN/FSQ-32 in the Ottawa sector to be completed by August 1, 1962, for use as a Direction Center,[1] but after the solid-state AN/FSQ-32 was cancelled, the underground bunker completed in 1963 was instead equipped with a vacuum tube AN/FSQ-7.General informationTypeCommand, control, and coordination systemLocation23rd & Colorado Blvd, Santa Monica, California[2]CountryUnited StatesCoordinates34°10′40″N 118°28′25″W﻿ / ﻿34.17778°N 118.47361°W﻿ / 34.17778; -118.47361[2]OpenedBuilt 1960-1Used until ~1970[3]Design and constructionArchitectIBM Kingston Engineering The AN/FSQ-32 SAGE Solid State Computer (AN/FSQ-7A before December 1958,[4]:27 colloq. "Q-32") was a planned military computer central for deployment to Super Combat Centers in nuclear bunkers and to some above-ground military installations. In 1958, Air Defense Command planned to acquire 13 Q-32 centrals[5] for several Air Divisions/Sectors. Contents 1 Background 2 Prototype 2.1 ARPA research 2.1.1 Time-sharing 2.1.2 Computer network 2.2 Description 2.2.1 Central Processing Unit 2.2.2 Memory 2.2.3 Input/Output 3 Notes 4 References Background[edit] In 1956, ARDC sponsored "development of a transistorized, or solid-state, computer" by IBM and when announced in June 1958,[6] the planned "SAGE Solid State Computer...was estimated to have a computing capability of seven times" the AN/FSQ-7.[4] ADC's November 1958 plan to field—by April 1964—the 13 solid state AN/FSQ-7A[4] was for each to network "a maximum of 20 long-range radar inputs [40 LRI telephone lines[7]] and a maximum dimension of just over 1000 miles in both north-south and east-west directions."[5] "Low rate Teletype data" could be accepted on 32 telephone lines[7] (e.g., from "Alert Network Number 1"). On 17 November 1958, CINCNORAD "decided to request the solid state computer and hardened facilities",[5] and the remaining vacuum-tube AN/FSQ-8 centrals for combat centers were cancelled (one was retrofitted to function as an AN/FSQ-7). "Each [sic] AN/FSQ-32 computer would be"* used:[8]:21 1. for "a combat center" (as with the vacuum-tube AN/FSQ-8), 2. to accept "radar and weapons connections" for weapons direction as with the AN/FSQ-7--e.g., for backup CIM-10 Bomarc guidance or manned interceptor GCI if above-ground Direction Center(s) could not function,[5] and 3. for "air traffic control functions".[8]:21 "Air Defense and Air Traffic Control Integration" was planned for airways modernization after the USAF, CAA, and AMB agreed on August 22, 1958, to "collocate air route traffic control centers and air defense facilities"[8]:24 (e.g., jointly use some Air Route Surveillance Radars at SAGE radar stations). The May 22, 1959, agreement between the USAF, DoD, and FAA designated emplacement of ATC facilities "in the hardened structure of the nine U. S. SCC's",[8]:24 and SAGE Air Defense Sectors and FAA regions were to have coincident boundaries in a June 19, 1959, air defense plan used to create a new SAGE Implementation Schedule on July 1, 1959.[8]:20 On December 21, 1959, the Office of Defense Research and Engineering informed NORAD a stop order had been placed on AN/FSQ-32 production and in January 1960, the Office of the Secretary of Defense recommended the SCC program be cancelled.[9] The AN/FSQ-32, as part of the SCC Program, was cancelled by March 18, 1960,[9] and the SAGE Air Traffic Integration (SATIN) was similarly cancelled by the DoD.[10] Back-Up Interceptor Control eventually with smaller solid-state computers at above-ground SAGE radar stations was instead implemented for survivability. Planned deployment was for Ottawa, St Louis, San Antonio, Raleigh, Syracuse, Chicago, Spokane, Minot, Portland, Phoenix, Miami (above-ground), Albuquerque (above-ground), and Shreveport (above-ground). (During 1959 SAGE/FAA "boundary alignments", the total was reduced to 12.}}[NB 1]) Prototype[edit] The prototype of the AN/FSQ-32 was the largest transistor (solid state) computer ever made.[citation needed] Initial weight: 66.5 short tons; 60.3 metric tons (132,960 lb), expanded (18 tape drives, 10 storage units): 90.8 short tons; 82.4 metric tons (181,560 lb).[11][12] The Q-32 prototype was installed at System Development Corporation (SDC) headquarters in Santa Monica, California,[13] and SDC developed the prototype software using JOVIAL. The mainframe occupied nearly an entire floor of a large office building (refrigeration units were also in the building).[dubious – discuss] The prototype used batch processing of the military data. ARPA research[edit] In the early 1960s, the AN/FSQ-32 prototype was taken over by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and remained in Santa Monica.[specify] This action set the stage for ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office. SDC's research included ways to permit the prototype to handle multiple batch tasks simultaneously ("time-sharing") and to simultaneously process data multiple geographically-separated computer users.[14] On April 23, 1963, Dr. J.C.R. Licklider, ARPA Director of Behavioral Sciences Command & Control Research, identified early challenges[specify] in establishing a time-sharing network of computers with the software of the era.[15] An early remote user of the prototype was the Augmentation Research Center at the Stanford Research Institute.[16] Time-sharing[edit] By June 1963 the Time-Sharing System (TSS) Model Zero was demonstrated after magnetic drums were added to the time-sharing. Each user was given a priority-based time slice, measured in milliseconds, when the user's program was written from the magnetic drums into much higher speed memory, processed, and then written back to the magnetic drums with any computational changes that had occurred. It was influenced by early experiments at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, and the CTSS project at MIT.[17] Terminals included several Teletype Model 33 ASRs. Computer network[edit] After the SAGE Sector Warning Network for the 1st operational SAGE direction center used the 1st operational computer network[4] (cf. the experimental networks for Bomarc test launches and SAGE compatibility tests), in October 1965 Lincoln Labs' used a TX-2 solid-state computer tied to the Q-32 prototype for the first telecommunication of time packets.[citation needed] Description[edit] The prototype was an IBM 4020 Military Computer[13][failed verification] that included a Central Processing Unit, memory, High-Speed Input/Output, Low-Speed Input/Output, and for both computer operations and maintenance,[18] an Operations Console. The AN/FSQ-32 central would have included additional equipment such as display and console equipment for use by Air Defense Command, Army Air Defense Command, Federal Aviation Administration, and other personnel (e.g., at SCC/DCs, weapons direction consoles for dispatching/guiding manned interceptors, launching/guiding CIM-10 Bomarcs, and launching Nike surface-to-air missiles). Central Processing Unit[edit] The Instruction set used a fixed length of one word providing 24 bits for the operation and 24 bits for the address. The address consisted of 18 bits (3 bytes) for the memory address, with other bits used for the specification of index registers and indirect addressing. The operation field provided the operation code and a variety of modifiers. Some modifiers allowed instructions to operate only on specific bytes of a word or on specific bits of a byte without separate masking operations. Other modifiers allowed the single 48-bit ALU to operate on a pair of 24-bit operands to facilitate vector operations. CPU controls included sense switches to control various software functions, a run/halt switch, and a switch, amplifier, and speaker assembly, to provide audio feedback or even play music, by connecting one of four bits in the main accumulator which could then be toggled under software control at an appropriate rate to produce whatever tones one wanted. Memory[edit] Memory was addressed by words, which were 48 bits long. Each word was divided into eight 6-bit bytes. A 6-bit byte, as opposed to the 8-bit byte in common use today, was common in IBM and other scientific computers of the time. The address space provided a maximum of 256K words. The prototype was equipped with 128k words (48 bits plus two parity bits) of memory that was oil and water cooled. Also considered as part of the memory subsystem in that they were addressed via fixed reserved memory addresses, were 4 48 position switch banks, in which a short program could be inserted, and a plug panel, similar to the one used in IBM Unit-Record equipment, that had the capacity of 32 words, so longer bootstrap or diagnostic programs could be installed in plug panels which could then be inserted into the receptacle and used as a primitive ROM. The memory had a cycle time of 2.5 microseconds,[19] and the lack of memory management was a limitation in the computer.[15] Input/Output[edit] High-Speed Input/Output provided interfaces to the Drum Memory system, which consisted of a control system, and two vertical drum memory devices. Each drum read and wrote 50 bits at a time in parallel so transferring data could be done quickly. The drums were organized as 17 fields with 8192 words per field for a total capacity of 139264 words. The motors that rotated the drums required 208 VAC at 45 Hz so a motor generator unit was required to change the frequency from 60 Hz. This added to the noise level in the computer room. The other connection to/from the HSIO was to the SACCS EDTCC, which then interfaced to the rest of the SACCS. Low-Speed Input/Output interfaced to several different devices: Communications Multiplexor Tape Controllers 1 and 2, connected to 16 IBM 729-V Tape Drives Disk File Controller, which was a modified Tape Controller, connected to a Bryant Disk File, which had 25 disks that were 39" in diameter, 125 read/write heads that were hydraulically actuated, and had a total capacity of 26 megabytes IBM 1401, which controlled data transfers from unit-record equipment: IBM 1402 Card Reader/Punch, IBM 1403 Line Printer, & 2 IBM 729-V Tape Drives 2 IBM Selectric Typewriters, (I/O Typewriters) one of which was used for operational messages and the other for diagnostic messages and maintenance activities. Notes[edit] ^ The 1959 plan retained AN/FSQ-32 deployments for the Albuquerque DC, Chicago SCC, Great Falls SCC, Ottawa SCC/DC, and San Antonio SCC/DC but redesignated 7 of the sector names for the deployments: 1958 plan Portland, Spokane, Minot, St Louis, Syracuse, Raleigh SCC/DC, Miami DC 1959 plan San Francisco SCC, Seattle SCC, Denver SCC/DC, Ft Knox (SCC/DC), Boston SCC,[where?] Atlanta SCC/DC, Montgomery DC and in effect, the Shreveport Q-32 (for a sector between the San Antonio and Miami/Montgomery sectors) was eliminated, reducing the planned AN/FSQ-32 deployments to 12. *The AN/FSQ-32 planned for the "Canadian" 35th Air Division (in the Ottawa Air Defense Sector) was to have the "DC program only",[4]:27 and the 3 centrals for Albuquerque, Miami, and Shreveport were planned for use only in Direction Centers (rather than Super Combat Centers or SCC/DCs).[4] References[edit] ^ "1958 NORAD/CONAD Historical Summary: July-December" (PDF).

During her singing career, she was often compared to Britney Spears.[1] Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 2.1 Music and singing 2.2 Television host 2.3 Modelling 3 Personal life 4 Albums 4.1 Albums 5 Duets with other Israeli artists 6 References Early life[edit] Born Liron Duani in Rishon LeZion, Israel, to Israeli-born parents of both Sephardic Jewish (Libyan-Jewish) and Ashkenazi Jewish (Polish-Jewish) descent. From a young age she enjoyed performing, especially dancing and cheerleading. Her older sister Yael Duani is also a well known actress. Duani attended the Gymnasia Realit high school in her hometown. She served as soldier in the Israel Defense Forces from 2005 to 2007.[2] She enrolled to the IDC Herzliya college in 2007,[3] studying communication,[3] and received her undergraduate degree in 2010. Career[edit] Music and singing[edit] In 2003, Duani was recognized for her debut album: The World Outside My Door. She earned the nickname Roni Superstar as the album included the hit single "Superstar", based on British singer Jamelia's cover song "Superstar". About two months later, Roni did her mandatory army service. Around the same time, she released her second album "Lo Otzeret," which was released in two separate parts. This album contained the hit song Adoni, composed and produced by the respected musician Ivri Lider.[citation needed] In 2007, she released a dance lesson DVD called "Al Ktzot HaEtzba'ot" (On The Tip of the Toes), along with a new hit single, "Tzafuf" (Crowded). After the release of her DVD, Roni spent the next two years working on her third album, and did not do much in the public eye, except when she participated in the 2008 Festigal. However, she came back to public attention in January 2010, when she released the single "Lo Sham," the first song off her third album. To obtain publicity for this new single, she organized an ARG-type game with the help of a friend of hers, and the Israeli entertainment news website "Walla!" The game ended with the release of the single and the accompanying music video.[citation needed] In May 2010, she released another single, "El Toch HaLayla", which was written by another Israeli singer Emily Karpel. She also recorded a version of this song in Chinese. In August 2010, Roni released her third single, "Ohevet, Ozevet." In an interview with the magazine "Maariv LaNo'ar," Roni stated that her third album will not be released as an actual physical album, but that she will continue to release singles on the Internet.[4] Television host[edit] This section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources.

For example, she is a frequent participant in the Festigal, a musical children's show that is performed by various Israeli celebrities every year around the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. She first participated in 2004, where she performed the song "Nesichat Pop." This song was later released as a bonus song on her second album. Roni also participated in Festigal 2005, whose theme was "Giborei Al" (Hebrew for "superheroes"), and was about a boy who saves the world and becomes "Extreme Boy". She played a superhero named Beat Woman.[citation needed] She performed in the 2008 Festigal, and participated in the 2010 show, playing Marie Antoinette. In addition to the Festigal, Roni has done many other stage shows for children. In 2006, she played Dorothy in a musical based on The Wizard of Oz. In 2009, she performed in another musical based on the movie Hercules. She has also done many children's television programs. In 2004, Roni joined the Israeli Nickelodeon network as a co-host one the shows "Mastik," "Achi Achoti," and "Jungle." In 2007, she joined the cast of the children's show Rosh Gadol. In the summer of 2010, she became a co-host on the program "HaMakom HaAmiti," which broadcasts on the Israeli television network "Arutz HaYeladim" (a children's channel).[citation needed] Since 2019, she hosts her own daily workout show on Sport 5 (Israel's Sports Channel), broadcasting from her own gym. Modelling[edit] From 2004 to 2007, she was a model for the Israeli swimsuit company Banana. Duani has also done modeling for the shoe company Converse, and the popular Israeli clothing store Castro. She also released a makeup/beauty care line for girls called U-Girl.[citation needed] Personal life[edit] On August 19, 2010, she was married to her Israeli boyfriend Chen Moncaz.[5] On July 17, 2016, she gave birth to her first son, Nuri. In September 2019 she gave birth to her daughter, Maya.[6][7] Albums[edit] Albums[edit] Year Album Israel Certificate Sales 2004 Olam Shalem Bachutz (The World Outside My Door) Gold 25,000+ 2005 Lo Otzeret I (Won't Stop Pt.

The word equilibrium implies a state of balance. Equilibrium thermodynamics, in origins, derives from analysis of the Carnot cycle. Here, typically a system, as cylinder of gas, initially in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is set out of balance via heat input from a combustion reaction. Then, through a series of steps, as the system settles into its final equilibrium state, work is extracted. In an equilibrium state the potentials, or driving forces, within the system, are in exact balance. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial state of thermodynamic equilibrium, subject to accurately specified constraints, to calculate, when the constraints are changed by an externally imposed intervention, what the state of the system will be once it has reached a new equilibrium. An equilibrium state is mathematically ascertained by seeking the extrema of a thermodynamic potential function, whose nature depends on the constraints imposed on the system. For example, a chemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure will reach equilibrium at a minimum of its components' Gibbs free energy and a maximum of their entropy. Equilibrium thermodynamics differs from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, in that, with the latter, the state of the system under investigation will typically not be uniform but will vary locally in those as energy, entropy, and temperature distributions as gradients are imposed by dissipative thermodynamic fluxes. In equilibrium thermodynamics, by contrast, the state of the system will be considered uniform throughout, defined macroscopically by such quantities as temperature, pressure, or volume. Systems are studied in terms of change from one equilibrium state to another; such a change is called a thermodynamic process. Ruppeiner geometry is a type of information geometry used to study thermodynamics. It claims that thermodynamic systems can be represented by Riemannian geometry, and that statistical properties can be derived from the model. This geometrical model is based on the idea that there exist equilibrium states which can be represented by points on two-dimensional surface and the distance between these equilibrium states is related to the fluctuation between them.

He ranks as one of the great masters of the Persian panegyric form known as qasideh. Mu'izzī's father, Abd al-Malik Burhani, was poet laureate of Sanjar under Malik Shāh I and Sultān Sanjar. His son followed, self-consciously, in his footsteps, styling himself as his father's deputy (nāyib) and inheriting his role.[1][2] He was renowned both in his own time and to later scholarship.[3] His surviving divan extends to 18,000 distichs. Anvari accuses Mu'izzi of copying the verses of other poets (which cannot be proven for certain), yet Anvari himself is known to have copied Mu'izzi's verses. Mu'izzi is said to have died by the arrow shot at him by the King's son in 1125 CE for reasons unknown. He was accidentally shot by Sanjar.[2] References[edit] ^ Donzel, E. J. van (1 January 1994).

It is a driver wrapper around the original Microsoft Windows NTFS file system driver using parts of ReactOS code. By taking this approach Captive NTFS aimed to provide safe write support to NTFS partitions. Until the release of NTFS-3G, it was the only Linux NTFS driver with full write support. On January 26, 2006 Jan Kratochvíl released version 1.1.7 of his package. This version restores compatibility with recent Linux kernels by replacing the obsolete LUFS (Linux Userland File System) module with FUSE (File System in Userspace), which as of Linux 2.6.14 has been included into the official Linux kernel. Captive NTFS requires NTFS.SYS which cannot be distributed for legal reasons. It can either be obtained from an installed Windows system (which most computers with NTFS partitions are likely to have) or extracted from certain Microsoft service packs.

Dorotheus was a learned priest of Antioch (Eusebius, VII.32) and a eunuch.[1] Dorotheus is said to have been driven into exile during the persecution of Diocletian, but later returned. He attended the Council of Nicaea in 325, but was exiled to Odyssopolis (Varna) on the Black Sea in Thrace by Julian the Apostate. There the 107-year-old priest was martyred for his faith. His feast day is observed June 5 according to the Gregorian calendar which coincides with June 18 on the Julian calendar.[2] See also[edit] Pseudo-Dorotheus, works pseudepigraphically attributed to Dorotheus of Tyre References[edit] ^ Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea, in Palestine (1865).

The club no longer exists. In 2002, they merged with Glasgow Southern to form Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC. Contents 1 History 1.1 Formation 1.2 National League 2 Merger 3 Honours 4 Notable former players 4.1 Notable non-Scottish players 4.2 Glasgow District players 5 References History[edit] Formation[edit] The club was founded in 1990 with the merger of Hutcheson's GSFP and Old Aloysians. As a struggling club about to be demoted to Division 7 of the McEwan's National League; the Old Aloysions members approved the merger first.[1] Hutcheson's GSFP were in Division 4 of the National League. Their EGM to approve the merger on 24 May 1990 was won by 57 votes to 8.[2] The new club Hutchesons Aloysians would take Hutcheson's GSFP's place in the league in Division 4 of the McEwan's National League for the coming 1990-91 season.[1] National League[edit] Starting in Division 4, the side secured promotion in its first year to Division 3. Hutchesons Aloysians then skirted between Division 3 and 4 before they finally made a challenge for the Division 3 title. The club initially suffered as it lost players and officials to Clarkston RFC who were pushing for a merger with Hutchesons Aloysians. Hutchesons Aloysians refused the merger; and although Club President Bernard Dunn initially voted for the merge he was later to say: "Thankfully, we’ve both managed to move forward from what was a very difficult time, and I believe it would now serve little purpose. The HA merger was a unique one, founded on the traditions of two good schools, and that’s why it works so well. I think we’re now of a size where we don’t need to merge."[3] Anthony Posa became Hutchesons Aloysians first full international cap when he played for Croatia against Czechoslovakia in a World Cup qualifier in October 2001.[4] In December 2000 he was interviewed before a match against Boroughmuir: "This is the first season I have played in the UK," says 29-year-old Posa. "So it is the first time I have played in the conditions you have in the depths of winter. Glasgow, particularly the guys at H/As, has treated me well. But the rain and mud are something else."[5] In the club's last season, before a merger with Glasgow Southern, Hutchesons Aloysians finally ensured promotion to Division 2.[6] They won the title beating Berwick 37-15.[7] Merger[edit] On 12 February 2002, officials from Glasgow Southern and Hutchesons Aloysians met again to discuss a merger. At the time both played in the same league, although Hutchesons Aloysians were at the top of table about to secure promotion. A potential higher league position in a higher division on offer was an incentive for Glasgow Southern to agree to the merger.[8] It was recognised that Glasgow Southern's facilities at Braidholm were far greater than those of Hutchesons Aloysians. That was an incentive for Hutchesons Aloysians to agree to the merger.[8] A further incentive to both teams was the success of the Glasgow Hawks merger. It was hoped that by merging two relatively strong Glasgow teams that they could emulate the success of the Hawks and then begin to challenge the Anniesland side.[8] The merger went ahead and the two teams merged to form Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians (GHA) for the start of the 2002-03 season.[9] GHA now has one of the largest catchment areas in Scotland, with a virtual monopoly on the south side of Glasgow plus several rugby-playing schools across the city feeding into their ranks.[10] Honours[edit] Division 4 - 2nd place, 1990–91, promoted to Division 3 Division 3 - 1st place, 2001–02, promoted to Division 2[7] Glasgow City Sevens Champions: 1997 Notable former players[edit] Notable non-Scottish players[edit] The following is a list of notable non-Scottish international representative former Glasgow players: Croatia Anthony Posa[4] Glasgow District players[edit] I.

The network at one time consisted of over 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) of pipeline and 46 other facilities. However, several of these facilities were closed before the GPSS was sold in 2015 and a number of the pipelines were mothballed and later abandoned. Earlier the total number of facilities on the GPSS was much larger than 46. For example, in 1989 there were 40 Petroleum Storage Depots in operation plus large numbers of other facilities such as pump-stations, junctions, and ingress and egress points.[1] It is interconnected with some other commercial pipeline systems.

In 1936, however, the RAF only possessed fuel reserves of 8,000 tons. These were at the time estimated to be enough for 10 days of war but in reality would have only represented one day of peak wartime usage.[2] Authorisation was given to build a series of fuel storage depots with semi-buried tanks in them that would be protected against aerial attack. Initially in 1936 the figure was set at 90,000 tons but this had been increased to 800,000 tons by 1938. By the start of World War II in 1939, a number of these new protected storage depots were already operational.[3] However, no pipelines were constructed until after the war started, with the first being built in 1941.[4] National pipeline system[edit] With the declaration of war and as pre-planned, the Petroleum Board came into operation with all former staff of the separate petrol companies coming under the Petroleum Board. The entire operation of fuel supplies was controlled from Shell Mex House in London.[5] The programme for building protected storage tanks continued and increased with the bulk of construction being between 1940 and 1942. The value of these protected storage tanks can be seen in that whereas 500,000 tons of above ground tanks were destroyed as a result of German bombing, only two protected storage tanks [8,000 tons], in Poole and Falmouth, were destroyed.[6] As fuel imports into Great Britain increased it became more difficult for the existing road and rail network to meet the demand to transfer the fuel eastwards and southwards from the west coast ports, the east coast fuel import facilities were closed because of the bombing. In April 1941 the go ahead was given for the construction of an oil pipeline from Avonmouth, where a large number of new protected storage tanks had been constructed, to the Thames (A/T pipeline). Concern as to the vulnerability of the fuel import facilities, led to the construction in 1942 of a pipeline linking the import facilities in the Stanlow area with those at Avonmouth.[7] This was followed by the construction of a pipeline running from off the A/T pipeline to the Southampton area for the stockpiling of fuel for the possible second front (R/H pipeline). During 1943 an entire ring-main linking the River Mersey, the Avonmouth area, the River Thames and up to the Humber area, was constructed. This was later extended into East Anglia to supply both the RAF and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF).[8] Linked to the GPSS were the cross-channel PLUTO pipelines which ran from the Isle of Wight to Cherbourg (code named BAMBI) and from Dungeness to Boulogne (code named DUMBO). The R/H pipeline had already been constructed but to supply DUMBO a new pipeline was built from the Thames to Dungeness in 1943.[9] The success of the PLUTO was, however, limited with only 8% of the fuel delivered between D-Day and VE Day being via them.[10] The official history states of them that 'PLUTO contributed nothing to Allied supplies at a time that would have been most valuable' and 'DUMBO was more valuable, but at a time when success was of less importance.' [11] Post World War II[edit] Immediately following the end of the war, most of the system was mothballed with surplus fuel disposed of, sites were reduced to minimum manning, and the pipelines filled with water.[12] However, this changed with the Cold War and the decision taken to recommission the network. One person working on bringing one previously mothballed storage depot back into operation related how it was buried beneath rubbish and long grass.[13] Two new fuel importation complexes were built in the 1950s, one to the south west of Bristol and one in the Stanlow area. A very large storage depot using salt caverns was constructed in Cheshire for storing both crude and refined oils.[14] On being recommissioned, the cross-Pennines pipeline was found to be badly corroded and in the 1950s a new pipeline was built from the Stanlow area to the Humber. New storage depots were built on this pipeline and a third new import facility was constructed on the Humber.[15] The first commercial usage of the system was immediately after the war to supply a depot on the River Severn from Avonmouth.[16] In the early 1950s some aviation fuel was pumped from Avonmouth to a depot on the River Thames to supply Heathrow Airport by road tanker from there. Esso also used the network to pump aviation fuel from the Fawley refinery to the Thames depot to supply Heathrow. The late 1950s also saw a spur off one of the PLUTO pipelines, originally from the Thames to Dungeness, brought back into operation to pump fuel from the Isle of Grain to the Thames Depot. From there aviation fuel was carried to Heathrow Airport, no longer by road tanker but via the first commercial pipeline which was constructed by Shell-Mex and BP in 1959.[17] In 1967 an agreement was reached with Conoco for leasing five petroleum storage depots for road loading of ground fuels. These were all supplied from the Immingham refinery which was connected to the GPSS pipeline network. During the late 1970s and early 1980s two commercial road loading facilities and two additional refineries were also connected to the GPSS.[18] There were a substantial number of depots that were not on the pipeline network. In the 1970s most of these were closed down. In the 1980s it was decided by the government that large scale strategic storage of petroleum as a civil reserve was no longer required. The salt cavities and some of the storage depots previously used for civil reserve storage were either closed or leased commercially.[19] The management of civil storage depots and the pipeline network initially came under the Board of Trade and then in 1942 under the Ministry of Power. This became the Department of Energy in the 1970s. In 1975 the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) was set up and took over the running of the department's system.[20] In 1985 the government closed BNOC but kept the GPSS and the Oil & Pipelines Agency (OPA) was set up purely to manage the GPSS.[21] Air Ministry storage depots and spur pipelines had been managed by the ministry and later by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) but in 1989 it was decided by the government to merge these sites and pipelines with the rest of the GPSS under the management of OPA.[22] Although the GPSS remained officially secret until the end of the Cold War, knowledge of it was in fact already in the public domain through the publication of various books an papers such as the Official History, Adams' papers and the series of articles in the Petroleum Times - 'Petroleum at War'. Private-sector usage was encouraged, but limited; the OPA's task was to provide "maximum development of private sector usage of the GPSS, provided this did not impinge upon its primary purpose of supplying the required fuel for defence purposes and did not require capital investment from public funds." As a result, the pipeline was extended and developed to allow connection to: all UK-based oil refineries and major fuel processing depots; as well as all major civilian airports - including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester - during the period of the Cold War. As a result of the 2000 fuel protests, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon instructed the MoD to plan for extension of the GPSS to beat any future fuel blockade.[23] Operations[edit] During World War II to protect the pipeline from damage or look for possible leaks, a team of men and women was employed to patrol the pipeline. Each person was responsible for a section of pipeline eight to ten miles long.[24] This was clearly very manpower intensive and later it was possible to use commercial not RAF helicopters to patrol the pipelines on a fortnightly basis and helicopter landing pads were constructed on the depots. In the 1950s a means of preventing pipeline corrosion known as cathodic protection became available. This applies a voltage to the pipeline such that the natural electrical action which takes place between pipe and soil leading to corrosion is reversed. Cathodic protection was applied to the pipeline system on a rolling programme which started in 1954 and was completed in 1970.[25] After the war the locations of the pipelines were marked with identification posts with bright yellow roofs with a thick black line. Even so, in March 2000 at Furness Vale near Whaley Bridge, High Peak, Derbyshire one of the lines was cut by workmen. Privatisation[edit] In May 2012 the UK Government (Conservative) announced plans to sell all or part of the GPSS[26] and legislation to enable it to do so was included in the Energy Act 2013. Three years after announcing the plan to sell GPSS, on 20 March 2015, the GPSS was acquired by Spanish oil network operator CLH for £82 million.[27] The MoD also signed a contract with CLH for the military to be continued to be supplied with fuel via the GPSS. It was stated that over the next ten years the MoD would pay £237 million for the use of the system.[28] MoD had previously paid nothing for the use of the GPSS and also gained from the surplus of income over expenditure that OPA used to generate from running the GPSS.[29] The sale did not include the six coastal Oil Fuel Depots owned by the MoD, which continued to be operated and maintained by the residual OPA.[30] Following its acquisition by CLH, the GPSS was subsequently renamed the CLH Pipeline System.[31] Since CLH have taken over the ownership of the GPSS a number of the pipelines that make up the system have been closed down.[32] See also[edit] UK oil pipeline network Oil terminals in the United Kingdom Petroleum Board References[edit] ^ Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017.

It obtained notoriety for continuing to run after the 1946 Loi Marthe Richard ban on brothels. It continued its operations for a while in secret.[1] L'Étoile de Kléber was located at 4 Rue Paul-Valéry in the 16th Arrondissement. It was founded and managed by a Aline Soccodato, known as Madame Billy. Its clients included King Farouk and Maurice Chevalier.[1] Contents 1 The Madame 2 The Brothels 3 The Second World War 4 See also 5 References The Madame[edit] Soccodato was born as Aline Roblot 1901 in Morey-Saint-Denis. She was orphaned at an early age and left school after primary school. First she worked on a farm and then in 1921, after a short love affair, she became a shop assistant in the Nouvelles Galeries store in Dole. She went to Paris, hoping to earn more as a prostitute. In Paris she met the American billionaire and lesbian Grace Palmier, who introduced her to the higher circles of society and a life of luxury. Grace named Aline Bilitis, referring to the poems of Pierre Louÿs. Bilitis was shortened to Billy as a nickname. The Brothels[edit] Roblot met the singer Soccodato, who appeared under the name of Josselin in L'Éuropéen and the Casino de Paris. She lived with him for two years in a wild marriage and they were married before the mayor of the 16th arrondissement. Aline, who had been working in 'hour hotels' with the knowledge of her partner, had plans for her own brothel. She opened her first house in Rue Cardinet in 1938, called Madame Billy, and it soon became very popular. Personalities from the highest circles quickly went to and fro: "A former councilor of state played with her "Demoiselle", dressed herself with pantyhose and rustling panties, and slapped with the "maidens", dressed-up girls. She also received a visit from a former Spanish ambassador, so fat that he could be found on his belt the chair if he wanted to get up."[2] In 1941, her husband was singing at "ABC" and had less time for Aline, so she decided to open a second house in Rue Viellejust (later renamed Rue Paul-Valéry). The new brothel was to be high class. Aline paid 150,000 francs for the takeover and got a four-storey villa with ten rooms, which she furnished with selected furniture. The garden was particularly beautiful. There was a salon with armchairs in the style of Louis XVI, which was full of potted plants. She also ensured that the women who worked for her were of the highest possible level. "The blonde, seductive Madame Billy knitted behind the bar, watching her band of young, handsome, distinguished girls, some of whom even came from good families."[2] In the autumn of 1941, Henri Coutet, asked the married couple, with whom he was a friend, to rent rooms on the upper floor to the singer Édith Piaf. So Piaf, with her half-sister Momone, her lover and her musicians, moved into the brothel. "Piaf: It's expensive with Mother Billy, but you eat at least well."[2] "At noon she usually ate only a steak that was covered with a lot of garlic. In the evening after her performance, she regularly celebrated and invited friends to come back with her, often more than fifteen. Jean Cocteau, who had written Le Bel Indifférent for her, liked to read his poems to her in the brothel salon, advised her what she was to read, and even gave her a moral education. [...] the guest list one evening: Marie Marquet, Raimu, Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, Marie Bell, Madeleine Robinson and Michel Simon."[3] The salon also hosted private events. For example, in 1942, a Dutch shipowner invited six friends to a very special dinner: Seven large plates were to be served, each with a naked girl sitting in the middle of the meal to be served. The waiters of Maxims had taken over the service and served the plates, on each of which a girl was surrounded with caviar, sole, cheese, fine pastry etc. In May 1943 Édith Piaf discovered nine young men and presented them to her friend, the group named Compagnon de la Chanson was later to become very famous in France. In December 1943 she finally left the brothel. The Second World War[edit] During the German occupation customers were officers of the German army and of the French Gestapo,[4] whose headquarters were only a short distance away at 93 Rue Lauriston, but this was an advantage inasmuch as they had meat, caviar and champagne which was transferred to L'Étoile's kitchen[4] After the war occupation clientele changed, and there were more and more allied officers in the L'Étoile de Kléber. The Soccodatos had hidden escaped British military, resistance fighters and Jews[5] in the war and forwarded encrypted messages to the French Resistance. They let their contacts play and were thus fortunate enough to be able to continue their operation and gain influence in the 1946 Law on Closures. "In my salon [...] writers, journalists, people from film and chanson, representatives of parliament, senate and government met. Members of parliament and senators represented a high proportion of my clientele. Almost all the members of the numerous governments under President Vincent Auriol and René Coty visited my house."[6] See also[edit] Prostitution in France Parisian Brothels References[edit] ^ a b Fox, James (May 1987).

To start the project, Stanford received $30 million from donors Burt McMurtry, former chair of the Board of Trustees, and his wife Deedee McMurtry, after whom the building was named. Other donors and University funds contributed the rest of the cost. The building houses art classrooms, art studios, screening rooms, the art and architecture library, a student lounge, a cafe, gallery space and faculty offices in 100,000 square feet of space.[2] The building’s design uses open space, emphasizes natural light and has classrooms with views. The two main strands of the department, art and art history, forms two literal "strands" of classrooms winding around a central library.[3] The McMurtry Building was designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, one of the world's leading architects and designer of New York's Highline Park.[4] References[edit] ^ "New McMurtry Building a fine showcase of the arts for Stanford".

It was also launched on November 22, 2010 as a daily news magazine program following the launch of regional news and public affairs teams on their satellite stations in Naga,[4] Bacolod, Cagayan de Oro[5] and General Santos[6][7] as answer to the regional editions of TV Patrol in these areas. However, its editions in Dagupan, Cebu, Iloilo and General Santos were cancelled during the last quarter of 2011 to first quarter of 2012 despite garnering good ratings, the three weekly editions were replaced by a travel show Let's Fiesta aired every Sunday while the operations of General Santos station was later on absorbed by the Davao station with Flash Bulletin as its solely produced program. Despite the cancellation of four editions, Isyu Ngayon remained in some areas.[8][9][10][11] With the plans of GMA to extend their Serbisyong Totoo and because of the outgrowing performance in the provinces, it led for two Isyu Ngayon to transform into live newscasts. On September 14, 2012, the Naga edition successfully ended following the launch of GMA Bicol originating station and was replaced by its flagship regional newscast Baretang Bikol, which later on became 24 Oras Bikol.[12] Then it was followed on February 4, 2013 when the Cagayan de Oro edition was replaced by Testigo Northern Mindanao, which later on became 24 Oras Northern Mindanao following the launch of the GMA Northern Mindanao originating station. On October 13, 2012, Isyu Mindanao was launched as a consolidation for Northern Mindanao, Davao and General Santos editions.[13] Eventually it was replaced by Isyu ug Istorya on July 19, 2014. The Bacolod edition, which was the only daily edition using the Isyu Ngayon brand, was aired side by side with Ratsada of GMA Iloilo[14] and later stopped, this edition became the flagship news and public affairs program of GMA Bacolod. Unlike other GMA regional newscasts which were aired live from their respective studios, the program was taped on location except for covering local events when they were being broadcast live. The edition however, was not included to the news programs of the network rebranded to 24 Oras. However, the program's episode for April 24, 2015 turned out to be their last episode after the network decided to strategically streamline its regional operations which led to the termination of some employees and talents and cancellation of other morning and afternoon programs as well as closing down other regional news departments in Ilocos, Bicol and Northern Mindanao on the same day, followed by Iloilo news department on November.[15][16][17] Segments[edit] Nangungunang Isyu - Story on the biggest ongoing event in the region with interviews with the biggest newsmaker in the locality.

Read Viemeister (1923–1993) was an industrial designer, FIDSA, and founded Vie Design Studios with Budd Steinhilber.[2] His mother Beverly Lipsett Viemeister (1927–2005) made many contributions to the Yellow Springs community before completing her degree in secondary education at Antioch College in 1965 and earning her master's in social work in 1968. After that she worked in social services. They had four children: Tucker, Kris, Heidi and Roslyn.[3] With his brother Kris, Tucker opened a jewelry shop called "Ohio Silver". They designed, crafted and sold fine jewelry, stained glass, leather work, and anything else they could make. He went to the Antioch School and Yellow Springs High School.

Their emphasis has been on comfortable, practical, fun stuff. In 1997, Hartmut Esslinger asked him to open a "frogdesign" studio in New York City. "Genius Watch" in BusinessWeek said: "Two of the most famous and mercurial figures in the product-design world are linking up." From 1999 to 2001, Viemeister carried a new dimension to the digital giant, Razorfish. As Executive Vice President, Research & Development, he built the physical industrial design capabilities and helped direct Razorfish on a global level.

Viemeister began working with architect David Rockwell in 2001. They founded the multi-disciplinary collaborative "Studio Red", dedicated to innovation for Coca-Cola. Tucker was Lab Chief, heading research and development at the Rockwell Group. The Lab encompasses digital interaction design, the material and image library, modeling and prototyping resources. the Lab focus is to explore the human relationship with technology, and its effect on experience. This activity includes: science and technology consultation, in-house design and creation of interactive environments/objects, and maintaining networks of technology solution providers. Key projects were the JetBlue terminal 5 Market Place at JFK, the interactive introduction installation for the Venice Architecture Biennale and the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas. In 2012, Viemeister joined Ralph Appelbaum Associates to design exhibitions, he worked on the Boris Yeltsin Center and the New York Experience before hurricane Sandy flooded the building and cut their collaboration short. In the same year, he established Viemeister Industries as a platform to support his work. <http://www.tuckerviemeister.com/> The designer was called “Guru” by BusinessWeek (8/97), a “scruffy brand-meister” by the Architect’s Newspaper (2/06), and "Industrial Design’s Elder Wunderkind" when ID included him in America's hottest 40. In 2007 New York magazine recognized him as a “Living Design Innovator”[5] Marriage and family[edit] He married Sarah Verdone (1965–2010), a freelance writer and blogger who worked for I.D. magazine. They had two daughters together, Josephine and Louisa, and lived in New York. Verdone died in March 2010.[6] Together with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC), her family and associates established a new annual literary award in her name.

His position was loosehead prop, and he played 111 tests for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks. Woodcock played for the All Blacks from 2002 to 2015,[3] scoring eight test tries. He was described by The Dominion Post as "widely regarded as the world's premier loosehead",[4] and by The New Zealand Herald as having the "best range of skills of any prop on the planet".[5] He is now the most capped All Black prop of all time, and is the second most capped player in Blues history, behind Keven Mealamu. He was a key member of the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cup winning squads, becoming one of only 20 players to have won multiple Rugby World Cups. Contents 1 Club rugby 2 All Blacks 2.1 International tries 3 Other activities 4 References 5 External links Club rugby[edit] He played for Blues in Super Rugby, and for North Harbour in the ITM Cup (when available). After 113 appearances for the Blues, he joined the Highlanders for the 2013 Super Rugby season.[6] However about a year later, after spending a year with the Highlanders who came 2nd to last in Super Rugby, Woodcock decided to return to the Blues where he would be closer to his family. He signed a 1-year contract. Woodcock has a reputation for playing as much rugby as possible. In 2005 he played in the first eleven of the twelve All Black test matches that year. From 2001 to 2004, he played in every match for North Harbour, except for the first two matches of 2004 due to being on All Black duty, and in 2002 and 2003, he played the full eighty minutes of every game for North Harbour. In 2006, he requested and received permission from the All Black coaching staff to return a week early from his enforced rest due to All Black duty, to play in North Harbour's Ranfurly Shield challenge against Canterbury, a match that North Harbour won 21–17, making them the Ranfurly Shield holders for the first time. All Blacks[edit] Woodcock made his international debut for New Zealand on 23 November 2002 when he started against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Woodcock was one of six debutants that day and started alongside Blues teammates Keven Mealamu and Daniel Braid, the former of whom would go on to become a long-serving front-row partner to Woodcock. Woodcock played the full 80 minutes, something rare for a prop and the All Blacks beat Wales 43–17. Woodcock did not play for the All Blacks again until 2004, a year when he started three times. Woodcock became a regular starter for New Zealand in 2005, starting in all three historic tests against the touring British and Irish Lions team, with the All Blacks failing to lose in all of those tests. Woodcock started in 10 of his 11 international appearances in 2005, and made 10 appearances for the All Blacks in 2006. He was the first All Black prop to score a test try against Australia in 20 years, when he scored the first try of his international career on 30 June 2007 against Australia in a 15–20 loss and another try against Australia the following week, when the All Blacks won 26–12. After his performances through the year, Woodcock was selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Woodcock made started in four of his three appearances in the competition, the most notable being when he played the full 80 minutes of New Zealand's shock 18–20 loss to France in the quarter-final of the World Cup, eliminating them for the competition. Woodcock was retained in the All Blacks in 2008 and on 2 August 2008, he became the first All Black prop to score two tries in a match (a rare feat for a prop against any side[citation needed]) against Australia in over 50 years. He had a heavy workload for the All Blacks in 2008, playing 12 tests for them that year. Woodcock celebrated his 50th test to kick off his 2009 international rugby season, but it was unfortunately spoiled by losing 22–27 on the occasion, against France in Dunedin. He scored New Zealand's only try in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final against France,[7] becoming the first All Black prop to score a try in a Rugby World Cup final, and only the second prop ever to do so.[citation needed] He received his 100th cap for the All Blacks in a test match in Wellington against Australia on 24 August 2013. Woodcock was not subbed off, with replacement prop Wyatt Crockett instead replacing Sam Whitelock in the 27–15 win over Australia. Woodcock was named in the 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where he scored a try in a 47–9 victory against Tonga in the final pool match of the competition on 9 October. His 118 test-match career in rugby union unfortunately ended in the same match, when he was injured and replaced by Wyatt Crockett in the 43rd minute. Joe Moody was subsequently flown over to England from New Zealand, in order to replace Woodcock, who remained in the country and collected his winners' medal following New Zealand's 31–17 victory in the final against Australia's Wallabies. In the 2016 New Year Honours, Woodcock was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to rugby.[8] International tries[edit] Try Opposing team Location Venue Competition Date Result 1 Australia Melbourne, Australia, Melbourne Cricket Ground, 2007 Tri Nations Series 30 June 2007 Lost 2 Australia Auckland, New Zealand Eden Park 2007 Tri Nations Series 21 July 2007 Won 3 Australia Auckland, New Zealand Eden Park 2008 Tri Nations Series 2 August 2008 Won 4 Australia Auckland, New Zealand Eden Park 2008 Tri Nations Series 2 August 2008 Won 5 Australia Brisbane, Australia Lang Park 2008 Tri Nations Series 13 September 2008 Won 6 South Africa Auckland, New Zealand Eden Park 2010 Tri Nations Series 10 July 2010 Won 7 South Africa Johannesburg, South Africa Soccer City 2010 Tri Nations Series 21 August 2010 Won 8 France Auckland, New Zealand Eden Park 2011 Rugby World Cup 23 October 2011 Won 9 Wales Cardiff, Wales Millennium Stadium 2012 End of Year Tour 25 November 2012 Won 10 Tonga Newcastle, England St James' Park 2015 Rugby World Cup 9 October 2015 Won Other activities[edit] Outside rugby, Woodcock has a deer farm near Kaukapakapa.[9] References[edit] ^ http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=1028 ^ http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=1028 ^ Gray, Wynne (3 August 2008).

It marked the directorial debut of John Glen, who had worked as editor and second unit director on three other Bond films. The screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson takes its characters and combines elements from the plots from two short stories from Ian Fleming's 1960 For Your Eyes Only collection: the title story and "Risico". In the plot, Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents. Some writing elements were inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the science fiction-focused Moonraker, the producers wanted a return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas. For Your Eyes Only was released in the UK on 24 June 1981 and in the US two days later; it received a mixed to positive critical reception. The film's reputation has improved over time, with reviewers praising the more serious tone. The film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the final Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; the company was absorbed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon after this film's release.

MI6 agent James Bond is ordered by the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray and MI6 Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the submarines' Polaris ballistic missiles. The head of the KGB, General Gogol, has also learned of the fate of the St Georges and already notified his contact in Greece. A marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, who had been asked by the British to secretly locate the St Georges, is murdered with his wife by a Cuban hitman, Hector Gonzales. Bond goes to Spain to find out who hired Gonzales. While spying on Gonzales' villa, Bond is captured by his men, but manages to escape as Gonzales is killed by a crossbow bolt. Outside, he finds the assassin was Melina Havelock, the daughter of Sir Timothy, and the two escape. With the help of Bond, Q uses computerised technology to identify the man Bond saw paying off Gonzales as Belgian underworld enforcer Emile Leopold Locque, and then goes to Locque's possible base in Cortina, Italy. There Bond meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos, who tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, known as "the Dove" in the Greek underworld, Kristatos' former resistance partner during the Second World War. After Bond goes with Kristatos' protégé, figure skater Bibi Dahl, to a biathlon course, a group of three men, which includes East German biathlete (and KGB agent) Eric Kriegler, chases Bond, trying to kill him. Bond escapes and then goes with Ferrara to bid Bibi farewell in an ice rink, where he fends off another attempt on his life by three men in ice hockey gear. Ferrara is killed in Bond's car, with a dove pin in his hand. Bond then travels to Corfu in pursuit of Columbo. There, at the casino, Bond meets Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are secretly recording their conversation. After Columbo and his mistress, 'Countess' Lisl von Schlaf, argue, Bond offers to escort her home with Kristatos' car and driver. The two then spend the night together. In the morning, Lisl and Bond are ambushed by Locque and his men, who run Lisl down, killing her. Bond is captured by Columbo's men before Locque can kill him; Columbo then tells Bond that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who was a double agent during the resistance and is currently working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. To prove his accusation, Columbo and his crew take Bond on a raid on one of Kristatos' opium-processing warehouses in Albania, where Bond encounters Locque and uncovers naval mines similar to the one that sank the St Georges, suggesting it was not an accident. After the warehouse is destroyed, Locque escapes; but Bond gives chase and kills him. Bond then rendezvous with Melina on her yacht. Using her father's daily log, they locate the St Georges and recover the ATAC from the wreckage. However, Kristatos is already waiting for them when they surface, and he takes the ATAC. After the two escape an assassination attempt through shark-infested waters, they discover Kristatos' meeting point with the KGB with the help of Melina's parrot, Max. With the help of Columbo and four of his men, Bond and Melina break into St Cyril's, an abandoned mountaintop monastery. As Columbo confronts Kristatos, Bond kills Kriegler. Bond retrieves the ATAC system and stops Melina from killing Kristatos after he surrenders. Kristatos tries to kill Bond with a hidden switchblade, but is killed by a knife thrown by Columbo; Gogol arrives by helicopter to collect the ATAC, but Bond throws it off the cliff, destroying it and declaring détente. Bond and Melina later spend a romantic evening aboard her yacht when he receives a call from the Prime Minister, leaving Max to flirt with the Prime Minister, much to the annoyance of Q, Grey, and Tanner. Cast[edit] Roger Moore as James Bond: MI6 agent 007, who is sent to retrieve a stolen "ATAC" system that could be misused for controlling British military submarines. Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock: The daughter of marine archaeologists who are murdered while tracking down the ATAC's whereabouts. Bouquet had auditioned for the role of Holly Goodhead in Moonraker, but was unsuccessful.[3] Topol as Milos Columbo: Kristatos' enemy and former smuggling partner who assists Bond in his mission. Named after Gioacchino Colombo, the Ferrari engine designer, specifically Ferrari 125, which Fleming admired.[4] Topol suggested the pistachios as a trademark of the character, which are used in a scene to orient Columbo's men on where to shoot.[5] Lynn-Holly Johnson as Bibi Dahl: An ice-skating prodigy with a crush on Bond, who is training with the financial support of Kristatos. Johnson was an ice skater before turning to acting, and achieved second place at the novice level of the 1974 United States Figure Skating Championships.[6] Julian Glover as Aristotle Kristatos: Initially shown as an ally, later as the main villain. A former war hero turned smuggler, planning to expand his fortune by selling the ATAC to the KGB. Glover had been shortlisted as a possible Bond for Live and Let Die, eventually losing out to Moore.[3] Michael Gothard as Emile Leopold Locque: A Belgian hired assassin and associate of Kristatos. Cassandra Harris as Countess Lisl von Schlaf: Columbo's mistress. At the time of filming Harris was married to future Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, and the couple lunched with the film's producer Albert R. Broccoli during filming.[3] John Wyman as Erich Kriegler: An East German Olympic class biathete and Kristatos' second in-command/KGB contact. Desmond Llewelyn as Q, the head of MI6's technical department. Jill Bennett as Jacoba Brink: Bibi's skating coach. Jack Hedley as Sir Timothy Havelock: Melina's father and a marine archaeologist hired by the British Secret Service to secretly locate the wreck of St. Georges. Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, M's secretary. Geoffrey Keen as Sir Frederick Gray: The British Minister of Defence, a politician in the British government. The role, along with Bill Tanner as Chief of Staff, was used to brief Bond in place of M, following the death of Bernard Lee.[7] James Villiers as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. The role of Tanner first appeared on film in The Man with the Golden Gun, although in an un-credited capacity. Villiers presumed he would play the role of M in subsequent films and was disappointed not to be asked; the producers thought him too young for the role and wanted an actor in his 70s.[8] John Moreno as Luigi Ferrara: 007's MI6 contact in northern Italy. Walter Gotell as General Gogol: Head of the KGB. Toby Robins as Iona Havelock: Melina's mother and wife of Sir Timothy. Jack Klaff as Apostis: One of Kristatos's henchmen and chauffeur. Stefan Kalipha as Hector Gonzales: A Cuban hitman hired by Kristatos to kill the Havelocks. Charles Dance as Claus, an associate of Locque. The role was early in Dance's career;[3] in 1989 he would play Ian Fleming in Anglia Television's Goldeneye: The Secret Life of Ian Fleming, a dramatised portrayal of the life of Ian Fleming.[9] Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevich: General Gogol's secretary. Janet Brown as the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who appears in the closing scene alongside John Wells as Denis. John Hollis as the "bald villain in wheelchair",[10] voiced by Robert Rietti.[11] The character appears in the pre-credits sequence and is both unnamed and uncredited. The character contains a number of characteristics of Ernst Stavro Blofeld,[10] but could not be identified as such because of the legal reasons surrounding the Thunderball controversy with Kevin McClory claiming sole rights to the Blofeld character, a claim disputed by Eon.[12] Bob Simmons, who previously portrayed Bond in the gun barrel sequences in the first three films and SPECTRE agent Colonel Jacques Bouvar in Thunderball, cameos as another villain as Gonzales' henchman who falls victim to Bond's exploding Lotus.[8] Production[edit] We had gone as far as we could into space. We needed a change of some sort, back to the grass roots of Bond. We wanted to make the new film more of a thriller than a romp, without losing sight of what made Bond famous – its humour.— John Glen[13] Eon Productions originally intended to produce For Your Eyes Only after The Spy Who Loved Me. However, after the success of Star Wars in 1977 the producers decided to produce Moonraker instead.[14] For Your Eyes Only marked a change in the make up of the production crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for four subsequent films.[15] The transition in directors resulted in a harder-edged directorial style, with less emphasis on gadgetry and large action sequences in huge arenas (as was favored by Lewis Gilbert).[16] Emphasis was placed on tension, plot and character in addition to a return to Bond's more serious roots,[17] whilst For Your Eyes Only "showed a clear attempt to activate some lapsed and inactive parts of the Bond mythology."[18] The film was also a deliberate effort to bring the series more back to reality, following the success of Moonraker in 1979.[19] As co-writer Michael G. Wilson pointed out, "If we went through the path of Moonraker things would just get more outlandish, so we needed to get back to basics".[15] To that end, the story that emerged was simpler, not one in which the world was at risk, but returning the series to that of a Cold War thriller;[15] Bond would also rely more on his wits than gadgets to survive.[20] Glen decided to symbolically represent it with a scene where Bond's Lotus blows itself up and forces 007 to rely on Melina's more humble Citroën 2CV.[15] Since Ken Adam was busy with Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion of Glen, Lamont created realistic scenery, instead of the elaborate set pieces for which the series had been known.[15] Writing[edit] Richard Maibaum was once again the scriptwriter for the story, assisted by Michael G. Wilson.[21] According to Wilson, the ideas from stories could have come from anyone as the outlines were worked out in committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson and stunt coordinators.[22] Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Ian Fleming short stories from the collection For Your Eyes Only: Risico and For Your Eyes Only.[23] Another set-piece from the novel of Live and Let Die – the keelhauling – which was unused in the film of the same name, was also inserted into the plot.[22] Other ideas from Fleming were also used in For Your Eyes Only, such as the Identigraph which comes from the novel Goldfinger, where it was originally called the "Identicast".[24] These elements from Fleming's stories were mixed with a Cold War story centred on the MacGuffin of the ATAC.[21] An initial treatment for "For Your Eyes Only" was submitted by Ronald Hardy, an English novelist and screenwriter in 1979. Hardy's treatment included the involvement of a character named Julia Havelock whose parents were assassinated by a man named Gonzales.[25] For Your Eyes Only is noted for its pre-title sequence, described variously as either "out-of place and disappointing"[21] or "roaringly enjoyable".[26] The scene was shot to introduce a potential new Bond to audiences, thus linking the new actor to elements from previous Bond films[22] (see casting, below). The sequence begins with Bond laying flowers at the grave of his wife Tracy Bond, before a Universal Exports helicopter picks him up for an emergency. Control of the helicopter is taken over by remote control by a bald man in a grey Nehru jacket with a white cat. This character is unnamed in either the film or the credits, although he looks and sounds like Ernst Stavro Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence or Telly Savalas.[21] Director John Glen referred to the identity of the villain obliquely: "We just let people use their imaginations and draw their own conclusions ... It's a legal thing".[3] The character is deliberately not named due to copyright restrictions with Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball, which supposedly includes the character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the organisation SPECTRE, and other material associated with the development of Thunderball.[27] Eon disputed McClory's ownership of the Blofeld character, but decided not to use him again: the scene was "a deliberate statement by Broccoli of his lack of need to use the character."[12] Maibaum later said "We tried to return to the earlier films with For Your Eyes Only but we didn't have Sean to make it real. And I was very disappointed with the way the love story was handled. The whole idea was that the great lover James Bond can't get to first base with this woman because she was so obsessed with avenging her parents' death. Nothing was ever done with it. It was as if the director didn't feel there was a love story there at all."[28] Casting[edit] Roger Moore had originally signed a three-film contract with Eon Productions, which covered his first three appearances up to The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent to this, the actor negotiated contracts on a film-by-film basis.[22] Uncertainty surrounding his involvement in For Your Eyes Only, considering his age, led to other actors being considered to take over, including Lewis Collins, known in the UK for his portrayal of Bodie in The Professionals;[29] Ian Ogilvy, like Moore known by his role in Return of the Saint;[30] Michael Billington, who previously appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me as Agent XXX's ill-fated lover, (Billington's screen test for For Your Eyes Only was one of the five occasions he auditioned for the role of Bond)[31] and Michael Jayston, who had appeared as the eponymous spy in the British TV series of Quiller[22] (Jayston eventually played Bond in a BBC Radio production of You Only Live Twice in 1985).[22] Timothy Dalton was strongly considered but Dalton declined, as he disliked the direction the series was taking at the time.[30][32][33][34] Eventually, this came to nothing as Moore agreed to play Bond once again. Bernard Lee died of cancer on 16 January 1981, after filming began on For Your Eyes Only, but before he could film his scenes as M, the head of MI6, as he had done in the previous eleven films of the series. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role as Broccoli refused to have the character recast and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence.[35] Chaim Topol was cast following a suggestion by Broccoli's wife Dana, while Julian Glover joined the cast as the producers felt he was stylish – Glover was even considered to play Bond at some point, but Michael G. Wilson stated that "when we first thought of him he was too young, and by the time of For Your Eyes Only he was too old".[15] Carole Bouquet was a suggestion of United Artists publicist Jerry Juroe, and after Glen and Broccoli saw her in That Obscure Object of Desire, they went to Rome to invite Bouquet for the role of Melina.[36] Filming[edit] A Citroën 2CV 007, the one used in the film. Production of For Your Eyes Only began on 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days shooting exterior scenes with the St Georges.[15][37] The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, as well as the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage.[38] On 15 September principal photography started on Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town,[19] which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons.[39] Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s.[36] The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën.[40] Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts – all had more powerful flat-four engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could get turned upside down.[41][42][43] In October filming moved to other Greek locations, including Meteora and the Achilleion.[44] In November, the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, while the second unit shot underwater scenes in The Bahamas. On 1 January 1981, production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February.[15] Since it was not snowing in Cortina d'Ampezzo by the time of filming, the producers had to pay for trucks to bring snow from nearby mountains, which was then dumped in the city's streets.[45] Many of the underwater scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were faked on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater.[19] Actress Carole Bouquet reportedly had a pre-existing health condition that prevented her from performing underwater stunt work.[15] Aquatic scenes were done by a team led by Al Giddings, who had previously worked on The Deep, and filmed in either Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage or an underwater set built in the Bahamas. Production designer Peter Lamont and his team developed two working props for the submarine Neptune, as well as a mock-up with a fake bottom.[46] Roger Moore was reluctant to film the scene of Bond kicking a car, with Locque inside, over the edge of a cliff, saying that it "was Bond-like, but not Roger Moore Bond-like."[15] Michael G. Wilson later said that Moore had to be persuaded to be more ruthless than he felt comfortable.[3] Wilson also added that he and Richard Maibaum, along with John Glen, toyed with other ideas surrounding that scene, but ultimately everyone, even Moore, agreed to do the scene as originally written.[15] The Monastery of the Holy Trinity in Meteora served as a location For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop was paid to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly critical of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, it was decided that the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting,[15][39] and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows[8] and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with back lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.[37] Roger Moore said he had a great fear of heights, and to do the climbing in Greece, he resorted to moderate drinking to calm his nerves.[15] Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling off the side of the cliff.[47] The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: "From where we were [shooting], you could see the local cemetery; and the box [to stop my fall] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots." The stunt went off without a problem.[15] Bond veteran cameraman and professional skier Willy Bogner, Jr. was promoted to director of a second unit involving ski footage.[45] Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me.[15] To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or behind it,[47] and a set of skis that allowed him to ski forwards and backwards to get the best shots.[19] In February 1981, on the final day of filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob. The incident, which took place a week after the FIBT World Championships 1981 where USA-1 bobsled driver James Morgan was killed in a crash during the four-man sled competition, resulted in the shortening of the track for future FIBT events. [8] The pre-credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London.[44] The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket.[48] Director John Glen got the idea for the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car.[15] Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.[36][49] Music[edit] Main article: For Your Eyes Only (soundtrack) The score of For Your Eyes Only was written by Bill Conti, who retained a number of John Barry-influenced brass elements in the score, but also added elements of dance and funk music.[50] While one reviewer observed that "Bill Conti's score is a constant source of annoyance",[51] another claimed that "In the end, For Your Eyes Only stands as one of the best James Bond film scores of the 1980s."[50] The title song, written by Conti and Michael Leeson, was sung by Sheena Easton, who holds the distinction of being the first title song artist to appear on screen in a Bond film,[24] as designer Maurice Binder liked Easton's appearance and decided to add her to the opening credits.[52] The producers of the film hired Debbie Harry to sing Conti and Leeson's song, but she quit when the producers refused to allow her band Blondie to write and perform an original song for the film.[53] Blondie's rejected song, titled "For Your Eyes Only," can be found on their 1982 album, The Hunter.[54] Release and reception[edit] For Your Eyes Only was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 24 June 1981,[55] setting an all-time opening-day record for any film at any cinema in the UK with a gross of £14,998[56] (£57,909 in 2019 pounds[57]).[56] The film went on general release in the UK the same day. For Your Eyes Only had its North American premiere in Canada and the US on Friday 26 June, at approximately 1,100 cinemas.[56] For Your Eyes Only watch, released as part of the merchandising for the film The film grossed $54.8 million in the United States,[58] (equivalent to $101.5 million at 2011 ticket prices[59] or $154 million in 2019 dollars,[60] adjusted for general inflation) and $195.3 million worldwide,[61] becoming the second highest grossing Bond film after its predecessor, Moonraker.[58] This was the last James Bond film to be solely released by United Artists, as by this time its owner Transamerica Corporation finalized the sale of the brand to MGM. Following the MGM and United Artists merger, later runs including future entries were released under "MGM/UA Distribution Co". The promotional cinema poster for the film featured a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left the bottom half of her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is the front of the suit.[62] The poster caused some furor—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee,[63] whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs.[64] There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.[63] A number of items of merchandising were issued to coincide with the film, including a 007 digital watch and a copy of Melina's Citroën 2CV by Corgi Toys.[62] Citroën itself produced a special "007" edition of the 2CV, which even had decorative bullet holes on the door.[65] Marvel Comics also did a comic book adaptation (see section below).[62] Contemporary reviews[edit] Derek Malcolm in The Guardian disliked the film, saying it was "too long ... and pretty boring between the stunts", although he admitted that the stunts were of a high quality.[66] According to Malcolm, Bond "inhabits a fantasy-land of more or less bloodless violence, groinless sex and naivety masked as superior sophistication", with Moore playing him as if in a "nicely lubricated daze".[66] Although Malcolm tipped the film for international box office success, he observed that he "can't quite see why the series has lasted so long and so strong in people's affections."[66] Writing in The Observer, Philip French commented that "not for the first time the pre-credits sequence is the best thing about the film."[67] French was dismissive of Moore's Bond, saying that Bond was "impersonated by Moore" and referred to Moore's advancing years.[67] Ian Christie, writing in the Daily Express, said that it was not "much of a plot, but it has a touch of credibility which is a welcome change from some of its predecessors."[68] Overall, Christie thought, For Your Eyes Only was "one of the better Bonds, with a nice balance between humour and excitement and the usual bevy of beautiful girls."[68] Christie's colleague in the Sunday Express, Richard Barkley, praised the film, saying that For Your Eyes Only "is one of the most exciting yet". Barkley describes Moore's Bond as having an "accustomed debonair calm and quiet authority". All told, Barkley thought "this Bond movie is smashing entertainment."[69] David Robinson, writing in The Times bemoaned the fact that the "dramatic bits between the set pieces don't count for much." Like other critics at the time his praise was more directed towards the stunt crews; they were "better than ever in this one."[70] The film critic for the magazine Time Out was brief and pithy: "no plot and poor dialogue, and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls."[71] For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post thought the film was "undeniably easy on the eyes", and further added "maybe too easy to prevent the mind from wandering and the lids from drooping."[72] Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces, calling them "more ponderous than sensational" and that there was "no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from "From Russia, With Love" or "You Only Live Twice" or "The Spy Who Loved Me" or "Moonraker." This is a Bond waiting for something inspired to push it over the top."[72] The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that "For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot" although he did say that the film is "slick entertainment" with a tone that is "consistently comic even when the material is not."[73] Jack Kroll in Newsweek dismissed the film, saying it was "an anthology of action episodes held together by the thinnest of plot lines", although he did concede that these set pieces are "terrific in their exhilaratingly absurd energy."[74] For Time magazine, Richard Corliss concentrated on the stunts, saying the team "have devised some splendid optional features for For Your Eyes Only" whilst also commenting on Roger Moore, saying that his "mannequin good looks and waxed-fruit insouciance" show him to be "the best-oiled cog in this perpetual motion machine."[75] Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail included it on his list of the year's worst films,[76] calling it "repellant"[77] and "ambitiously bad".[76] French filmmaker Robert Bresson admired the film. "It filled me with wonder because of its cinematographic writing ... if I could have seen it twice in a row and again the next day, I would have done."[78][79] Elsewhere Bresson said he also loved the film's ski chase.[80] Reflective reviews[edit] Opinion on For Your Eyes Only has improved with the passing of time, though some reviews are still mixed to positive: as of January 2019[update], the film holds a 73% 'fresh' rating from Rotten Tomatoes,[81] being ranked eleventh among the 24 Bond films.[82] Ian Nathan of Empire gives the film only two of a possible five stars, observing that the film "still ranks as one of the most forgettable Bonds on record."[83] In 2006, IGN chose For Your Eyes Only as the sixth best Bond film, claiming it is "a good old-fashioned espionage tale",[84] a placement shared by Norman Wilner of MSN, who considered it "the one Moore film that seems to reach back to Connery's heyday",[85] and Entertainment Weekly chose it as the tenth best in 2008, saying it was a "return to low-tech, low-key Bond [with] ... some of the best stunts since the early days".[86] In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of For Your Eyes Only and observed that the film is "admirable in intent" but that it "feels a little spare", largely because the plot has been "divested of the bells and whistles that hallmark the franchise".[51] James Berardinelli wrote that the film was "a solid adventure, although it could have been better",[87] while Danny Peary thought "There are exciting moments, but most of it is standard Bond fare," going on to describe For Your Eyes Only as "an attempt to mix spectacle with [the] tough, believable storylines of early Bond films ... [it] is enjoyable while you're watching it. Afterward, it's one of the most forgettable of the Bond series."[88] Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, thought For Your Eyes Only was Roger Moore's best Bond film.[89] Although Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly ranks Carole Bouquet playing Melina as the "worst babe" of the seven Roger Moore James Bond films,[90] his colleague, Joshua Rich disagreed, putting her tenth in the overall 10 Best Bond Girls listing from the 21 films released up to that point.[91] Entertainment Weekly also ranked Lynn-Holly Johnson as Bibi Dahl as ninth on their list of the 10 worst Bond girls from the 21 films that had been released.[92] After 20 films had been released, IGN ranked Bouquet as fifth in their 'top 10 Bond Babes' list,[93] and The Times thought she was sixth on their list of the Top 10 most fashionable Bond girls after 21 films had been released.[94] Accolades[edit] The song "For Your Eyes Only" was nominated for a Best Original Song at the 39th Golden Globe Awards[95] and Best Original Song at the 1981 Academy Awards, losing out at both ceremonies to "Arthur's Theme" from the film Arthur.[96] However, the 1981 Academy Awards ceremony did see the presenting of the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to producer Albert R. Broccoli.[97] The Writers Guild of America nominated the script by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum for Best Adapted Screenplay – Comedy or Musical Picture.[98] In 2004 the American Film Institute nominated the song "For Your Eyes Only" from the film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs.[99] Adaptations[edit] Two-part For Your Eyes Only comic book adaptation by Marvel Comics Main article: James Bond comic books As part of the merchandising of For Your Eyes Only, Marvel Comics published an adaptation of the movie as issue 19 of Marvel Comics Super Special; this was also repackaged as a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film.[62][100] The first issue was released in October 1981 and was soon followed by the second issue in November of the same year. The adaptation was written by Larry Hama, pencilled by Howard Chaykin, inked by Vincent Colletta, and edited by Dennis O'Neil.[101] It was the second film in the series to have a comic book tie-in, following a Dr. No comic in 1962. Marvel Comics would go on to publish an Octopussy comic book adaptation in 1983. In a 2015 interview with CBC Radio One Lee Demarbre and Ian Driscoll announced their plans to make a Canadian film adaptation of For Your Eyes Only set in Ottawa, which they intend to be the first installment in a four-film series.[102] The production of a film is possible because Canada enforces the Berne Convention and the Copyright Act automatically releasing an author's entire collected works to the public domain 50 years after their death, causing Ian Fleming's works to enter the public domain in Canada in 2014.[103] Demarbre and Driscoll expressed interest in casting Ryan Reynolds as James Bond; Jessica Paré as Judy Havelock; Donald Sutherland, Christopher Plummer, and Michael Ironside as supporting characters; and the Dead Obies as the performers of the title song. Although a film adaptation will not be releasable in the United States and Europe due to differing copyright law they believed it could recoup its profits through a release in Asia, including China.[104] See also[edit] Outline of James Bond References[edit] ^ "For Your Eyes Only".

The oil is colorless or light yellow and smells and tastes of nutmeg. It contains numerous components of interest to the oleochemical industry. The essential oil consists of approximately 90% terpene hydrocarbons. Prominent components are sabinene, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene. A major oxygen-containing component is terpinen-4-ol. The oil also contain small amounts of various phenolic compounds and aromatic ethers, e.g. myristicin, elemicin, safrole and methyl eugenol. The phenolic fraction is considered main contributor to the characteristic nutmeg odor.[1] General uses[edit] The essential oil is obtained by the steam distillation of ground nutmeg and is used heavily in the perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. The nutmeg essential oil is used as a natural food flavouring in baked goods, syrups, beverages (e.g. Coca-Cola), sweets etc. It replaces ground nutmeg as it leaves no particles in the food. The essential oil is also used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries for instance in tooth paste and as a major ingredient in some cough syrups.[medical citation needed] References[edit] ^ Bauer, K., D.

The name means the speckled mountains in Irish, a possible reference to their appearance when more quartz rock survived on the outside of the cairns, causing them to sparkle in the sun. The "mountains" cover an area of 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) and include only two major hills, Carrowkeel at 321 metres (1,053 ft), and Kesh Corann at 359 metres (1,178 ft).[1] Carrowkeel hill contains the Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery. The Caves of Kesh are visible on the west side of Kesh Corran from the R295 road and the Dublin–Sligo railway line. References[edit] ^ Don Cotton. "Bricklieve Mountains".

It was an offshoot of the militant suffragettes after the Pankhursts decide to rule without democratic support from their members. Contents 1 History 2 The Vote and growth in the Women's Freedom League 3 Protests and events 4 Archives 5 See also 6 References 7 External links History[edit] The group was founded in 1907 by seventy-seven members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) including Teresa Billington-Greig, Charlotte Despard, Alice Schofield, Edith How-Martyn and Margaret Nevinson. They disagreed with Christabel Pankhurst's announcement that the WSPU's annual conference was cancelled and that future decisions would be taken by a committee which she would appoint.[1] The League opposed violence in favour of non-violent forms of protest such as the non-payment of taxes, refusing to complete census forms and organising demonstrations, including members chaining themselves to objects in the Houses of Parliament. It grew to over 4,000 members and published The Vote newspaper weekly from 1909–1933.[2] Sarah Benett was the League's Treasurer until her resignation in 1910. Dr Elizabeth Knight was a source of funds for the Women's Freedom League. She took over as Treasurer from Constance Tite in 1912 where she improved the WFL's financial situation. Before she was appointed, the league had had serious financial problems and on occasions had had to appeal to its members for loans. Knight introduced new fund raising schemes for the league although finances were improved by large donations by an "anonymous" person. It is suspected that this person was Knight.[3][4] 4 July 1930 issue of The Vote In 1912, Nina Boyle became head of the WFL's political and militant department.[5] She published many articles in the WFL's newspaper, The Vote. Boyle started a campaign for women to become Special Constables. This campaign coincided with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and the call for volunteers for the war effort which Boyle wished to see taken up by women as well as men.[6] When the request was officially refused, Boyle, together with Margaret Damer Dawson, a wealthy philanthropist and herself a campaigner for women's rights,[7] established the first voluntary women's police force-the Women Police Volunteers (WPV). The League continued their pacifism during the First World War, supporting the Women's Peace Council. On the outbreak of war, they had suspended their campaigns and undertook voluntary work In the 1918 general election, Despard, How-Martyn and Emily Frost Phipps stood unsuccessfully in London constituencies as independent women's rights anti-war candidates. They celebrated the achievement of suffrage and refocussed the WFL's activities on equality, including equal pay and equality of morality. The group declined in membership, but continued under the leadership of Marian Reeves to organise annual birthday parties for Despard, and maintain the Minerva Club in Brunswick Square. After Reeves' died in 1961, the organisation voted to dissolve itself.[8] The Vote and growth in the Women's Freedom League[edit] After the creation of the Women's Freedom League in 1907, it grew rapidly throughout Great Britain. The league consisted of sixty branches and had nearly four thousand members.[9] The league established its own newspaper called The Vote.[9] Members of the League who were writers led to the production of the newspaper. The Vote became the primary means of communication with the public, informing readers of campaigns, protests, and events.[9] The newspaper helped to spread ideas concerning the First World War, allowing for the Women's Freedom League to advocate against the war.[9] Members of the League refused to become involved in campaigning efforts led by the British Army. Members were upset when their women’s suffrage campaign came to a halt while the war was in progress.[9] Protests and events[edit] The League's main objective was to criticise, oppose and reform the government. The League held protests that advocated pacifism during the First World War.[10] Not only did the League oppose the war, but they also used peaceful forms of protest only such as refusing to complete census forms and not paying taxes.[10] For example, in 1908 and 1909 the members chained themselves to various objects in Parliament in order to protest against the Government.[10] On 28 October 1908, three members of the Women's Freedom League, Muriel Matters, Violet Tillard, and Helen Fox, released a banner at the House of Commons. The women also chained themselves to the grille above a window.[11] Law enforcement had to remove the grille while they were still attached until they could file off the locks that held them connected to the window. This protest became known as the Grille Incident.[11] Anna Munro advertising the Scottish Women's Freedom League Two members of the League, Alice Chapin and Alison Neilans, attacked polling stations during the 1909 Bermondsey by-election, smashing bottles containing corrosive liquid over ballot boxes in an attempt to destroy votes. A presiding officer, George Thornley, was blinded in one eye in one of these attacks, and a Liberal agent suffered a severe burn to the neck. The count was delayed while ballot papers were carefully examined, 83 ballot papers were damaged but legible but two ballot papers became undecipherable.[12] Later they were sentenced to three months each in Holloway Prison.[13] The "Brown Women" were named after the brown coats that the walkers wore. Agnes Brown (coincidentally), Isabel Cowe and four others set off from Edinburgh to walk to London. They had white scarfs and green hats and as they travelled they gathered signatures for a petition for women's rights.[14] The hikers had to walk fifteen miles and attend a meeting each day and in this way they took five weeks to get to London.[15] Archives[edit] The archives of the Women's Freedom League are held in The Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics.[16] See also[edit] Minerva Café, opened by the Women's Freedom league in 1916 Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom List of suffragists and suffragettes Timeline of women's suffrage Women's suffrage organisations History of feminism References[edit] ^ "Alice Schofield".

The team, which was a member of the Southern Conference (SoCon), was coached by William Alexander in his ninth year as head coach. Alexander compiled a record of 10–0 (7–0 SoCon) and outscored his opponents 213 to 40. Georgia Tech played its home games at Grant Field. The team was selected national champion by Berryman, Billingsley, Boand, Football Research, Helms, Houlgate, NCF, Poling, and Sagarin (ELO-Chess), while Parke Davis named them co-champion as shared with Detroit.[3] Additionally, USC also earned recognition under the Dickinson System. USC declined the 1929 Rose Bowl invitation, resulting in a matchup of California and Georgia Tech. The game was decided by a safety, which was scored after Cal's Roy "Wrong Way" Riegels ran 65 yards (59 m) in the wrong direction. Several Georgia Tech players received postseason honors. Captain and center Peter Pund was a consensus All-American. Coach Knute Rockne said of Tech's 13–0 defeat of Notre Dame, "I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund". Tackle Frank Speer was also selected as a first-team All-American by the Associated Press. Contents 1 Before the season 2 Schedule 3 Season summary 3.1 V. M.

Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined".[20][21] Rockne later also wrote of an attack on his coaching in the Atlanta Journal, "I am surprised that a paper of such fine, high standing [as yours] would allow a zipper to write in his particular vein ... the article by Fuzzy Woodruff was not called for".[22] Tech's backfield coach Don Miller was a former player of Rockne's, one of the "Four Horsemen". As coach Alexander explained, "Coach Miller knows the Notre Dame offense of Knute Rockne as well as any man alive. It's virtually the same offense that Kid Woodruff has at Georgia."[23] Georgia Tech's starting lineup was Holland (left end), Maree (left tackle), Westbrook (left guard), Pund (center), Drennon (right guard), Speer (right tackle), Waddey (right end), Durant (quarterback), Mizell (left halfback), Thomason (right halfback), and Randolph (fullback).[18] North Carolina[edit] Georgia Tech at North Carolina 1 234Total • Ga.

Tech 0 260 8 Cal 0 007 7 Date: January 1, 1929Location: Rose BowlPasadena, CAGame attendance: 66,604Referee: C. W. Streit Sources:[38] Under the Dickinson System, USC was recognized as #1 but the 1929 Rose Bowl was contested between the #2 and #3 teams, California and Georgia Tech. The game was decided by a safety scored after California center Roy "Wrong Way" Riegels ran 65 yards (59 m) in the wrong direction, having picked up a fumble by Stumpy Thomason.[38] Roy Riegels' wrong-way run. Thirty yards (27 m) from Tech's end zone, Riegels was turned around and ran many yards in the wrong direction.[4] Riegels told the Associated Press, "I was running toward the sidelines when I picked up the ball ... I started to turn to my left toward Tech's goal. Somebody shoved me and I bounded right off into a tackler. In pivoting to get away from him, I completely lost my bearings."[39] Teammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels, screaming at him to stop. Known for his speed, Lom finally caught up with Riegels at California's 3-yard (2.7 m) line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately rushed by a wave of Georgia Tech players, and tackled by Frank Waddey and Vance Maree at the 1-yard (0.91 m) line.[40] The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Tech a 2–0 lead.[41][42] External video Riegels' wrong way run, YouTube video. During Roy's wrong-way run, coach Alexander told his excited players, who were jumping near the team's bench; "Sit down. Sit down. He's just running the wrong way. Every step he takes is to our advantage".[43] Broadcaster Graham McNamee, who was commentating the game on radio, said during Riegels' run; "What am I seeing? What's wrong with me? Am I crazy? Am I crazy? Am I crazy?"[44] After the play, Riegels was so distraught he had to be persuaded to return to the game for the second half by his head coach Nibs Price. Riegels said, "Coach, I can't do it. I've ruined you, I've ruined myself, I've ruined the University of California. I couldn't face that crowd to save my life." Coach Price responded by saying "Roy, get up and go back out there—the game is only half over".[45] Riegels did play on; he turned in a strong second-half performance, including blocking a Georgia Tech punt.[46] Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, but that was not enough.[47] Georgia Tech won the game and its second national championship 8–7. Its starting lineup was Waddey (left end), Speer (left tackle), Drennon (left guard), Pund (center), Westbrook (right guard), Maree (right tackle), Jones (right end), Durant (quarterback), Thomason (left halfback), Mizell (right halfback), and Lumpkin (fullback).[48] Awards and honors[edit] Individual[edit] Several Georgia Tech players received post-season honors. Tackle Frank Speer was selected as a first-team All-American by the Associated Press.[49] Center Peter Pund was recognized as a consensus All-American.[50] Halfback Warner Mizell was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Southern. Ends Tom Jones and Frank Waddey, tackle Vance Maree, and guard Raleigh Drennon were also placed on All-Southern teams.[51] Coach Alexander called Drennon "the best all around guard that ever put a cleat into Grant Field."[13] National champions[edit] Plaque at Georgia Tech honoring their National Championship seasonBoth USC and Georgia Tech claimed national championships for 1928.[52] Georgia Tech was retroactively selected as the national champion by the Berryman QPRS system, Billingsley Report, Boand System, College Football Researchers Association, Helms Athletic Foundation, Houlgate System, National Championship Foundation, Poling System, and Jeff Sagarin's ELO-Chess methodology system, and as a co-national champion by Parke H. Davis.[53] In honor of the Rose Bowl victory, Stumpy Thomason was given a bear cub by a local businessman. He grew attached to it, would drive it around town, and feed it Coca-Cola.[54] Personnel[edit] Depth chart[edit] The following chart depicts Tech's lineup during the 1928 season with games started at the position shown in parenthesis.[27] The chart mimics the offense after the jump shift has taken place.

The system works by encoding digits into a segment matrix similar to the seven-segment matrices used in digital displays. The matrix is then divided into two component patterns that reveal the whole when superimposed.[1] Half of the pattern is printed on a transparent region of a plastic card, while the other is displayed on an electronic screen such as a computer monitor. These are referred to as the key pattern and challenge pattern, respectively.[1] Each key pattern is unique, and the challenge pattern can only be decoded by its corresponding printed key.[1] By varying the challenge pattern displayed on the screen, a series of digits can be communicated to the card holder without being visually revealed on the screen. PassWindow is typically implemented such that an animated, perpetually looping sequence of challenge patterns is displayed, each encoding a single digit placed in a random location within the matrix. A valid solution to this challenge then consists of a specified number of consecutively appearing digits. Contents 1 Use in two-factor authentication 1.1 Generation of one-time passwords 2 Mutual authentication 2.1 Passive mutual authentication with PassWindow 2.1.1 Transaction verification 3 History 4 Media appearances 5 References 6 External links Use in two-factor authentication[edit] By printing a PassWindow key pattern on a piece of transparent media, such as a transparent section of a plastic card, a standard plastic ID-1 card can be used as physical token ( something you have) that can be used in a two-factor authentication system. Generation of one-time passwords[edit] Using the PassWindow system, a challenge pattern containing a string of digits and/or letters can be generated for a specific key pattern by an authentication server with knowledge of the shared secret (the user's key pattern). The user decodes the sequence of digits from the pattern using their PassWindow key and sends this as a response to the server's challenge. The correct response confirms that the client has physical access to the token. These digits are then used as a one-time password.[1] Mutual authentication[edit] Mutual authentication or two-way authentication (sometimes written as 2WAY authentication) refers to two parties authenticating each other suitably. In technology terms, it refers to a client or user authenticating themselves to a server and that server authenticating itself to the user in such a way that both parties are assured of the others' identity. When describing online authentication processes, mutual authentication is often referred to as website-to-user authentication, or site-to-user authentication. Passive mutual authentication with PassWindow[edit] In the simplest case, the client verifies that the server from which they are receiving their challenge by confirming that the solution is intelligible when they superimpose their key over the challenge. An unintelligible or corrupted challenge alerts the user that they may not be connected to the server they intend.[1] Transaction verification[edit] In addition, a known string of digits may be encoded into the challenge at the time of generation to provide additional server-to-client authentication to prevent the replay of stored challenges. Known as a verification code, examples include destination account numbers or transaction totals when used to secure online monetary transactions. This use is often referred to as transaction verification and forms the primary basis for PassWindow's exceptional resilience to Man-in-the-middle (MITM) and Man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks.[1] History[edit] Matt Walker, Australian, invented the original PassWindow concept after many years researching various online two-factor authentication systems. The high cost of many electronic token systems, as well as their inability to protect against an ever-increasing array of complex attacks, forced Matthew to completely rethink the way modern authentication is conducted. During the intervening period, while the security world looked for ever more complex and high-tech solutions, which it was apparent were increasingly vulnerable to ever more complex and high tech attacks, Matthew decided to take the opposite approach and look for an authentication solution with pure simplicity at its core. In the process, he discovered an entirely new secure method in online security.[2] Media appearances[edit] PassWindow first appeared in the media in May 2009 as a 'Cheap solution for security' on account of its ability to securely produce one-time passwords without the need for electronics to be deployed to its end users.[3] PassWindow's inventor, Matthew Walker, appeared on the Australian television program The New Inventors in June 2009.[4] PassWindow has since appeared several times in the media,[5][6] as well as being the subject of a white paper written by VEST corporation, France.[1] PassWindow has been selected as a finalist in The Wall Street Journal 2010 Asian Innovation Awards.[7] PassWindow has been featured in The Wall Street Journal as "A New Way to Outwit Internet Fraudsters".[8] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g S.

It was probably composed in early 1686 and performed either in the apartments of the Dauphin that spring or at Fontainebleau in the autumn. Charpentier himself sang the title role, joined by musicians of Mademoiselle de Guise and members of the Dauphin’s little ensemble; it was Charpentier’s last appearance with this ensemble. The libretto, whose author is unknown, is based on the myth of Orpheus as told by Ovid in Book 10 of the Metamorphoses. It is debatable whether the opera as it survives in the manuscript is complete or not. The musicologist H. Wiley Hitchcock believes Charpentier may have planned (and composed) a third, concluding act. The opera is not to be confused with an earlier work, by Charpentier, Orphée descendant aux enfers H.471, which is a cantata for three male voices, 2 violins, recorder, flute, and bc.

Euridice and her nymph companions gather flowers, but Euridice steps on a snake, is stung and dies. Encouraged by his father Apollon (the god Apollo) Orpheus decides to follow Euridice to the underworld and rescue her. Act 2[edit] Orpheus arrives in the underworld where he sees Tantale (Tantalus), Ixion and Titye (Tityus) being punished eternally for their crimes. Orpheus' singing allays their suffering. His music also wins over Pluton (Pluto, the god of the underworld), who allows him to return with Euridice to the world of the living providing he does not turn back to look at her before they have left the realm of the dead.

It draws visual and narrative inspiration from the artist's eponymous collection of sketches and focuses on an anachronistic story related to creation of The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife. Plot[edit] Tetsuzō (Ken Ogata) is an unsuccessful ukiyo-e painter who lives with his daughter Ōei (Yūko Tanaka) in poverty over a geta shop owned by Ōyaku (Nobuko Otowa), the older wife of the aspirant writer Sashichi (Toshiyuki Nishida) who is a childhood friend of Tetsuzō. Tetsuzō lives by borrowing money from his adoptive father, the Shogunate mirror-maker Nakajima Ise (Frankie Sakai). One day, he meets a young, beautiful prostitute named Ōnao (Kanako Higuchi) and leaves her to Nakajima as a concubine. Meanwhile, Tetsuzō has grown a destructive obsession for Ōnao. Ōnao is a sadist with a traumatic past. She psychologically torments Nakajima until he hangs himself and leaves. After Ōyaku dies, Sashichi, adopting the pen name Bakin, devotes his life to writing and ignores Ōei's advances who has intimate feelings for him. Nevertheless, Ōei continues to love him, which results in her celibacy. Years later and after hard-earned fame, Tetsuzō (now Hokusai) is 89. He lives by painting Ichimatsu dolls with Ōei. One day, Ōei finds a peasant girl who looks like Ōnao (played by the same actress). After he sees a young ama playing with a dead octopus, Hokusai persuades the girl to pose for the shunga of an ama engaged in a threesome with two octopuses.

Born in Cölln an der Spree, she was the fourth of ten children born from the marriage of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and Henriette Catherine of Orange-Nassau. From her nine older and younger siblings, five survive adulthood: Henriette Amalie (by marriage Princess of Nassau-Dietz), Marie Eleonore (by marriage Princess Radziwiłł and Duchess of Olyka), Henriette Agnes, Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and Johanna Charlotte (by marriage Margravine of Brandenburg-Schwedt).[1][2] Life[edit] In 1680, and thanks to her father's instigation, Elisabeth Albertine was chosen Princess-Abbess of Herford Abbey as Elisabeth IV, securing with this the support of the Rhenish Imperial College prelate (German: Reichsprälatenkollegiums). She remained in the post for six years, until her marriage was arranged and moved to Barby; however, several Herford artists and merchants followed her. In Dessau on 30 March 1686, Elisabeth Albertine married Henry, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels-Barby. Elisabeth Albertine's paternal great-great grandmother was Agnes of Barby-Mühlingen; this give to Henry some blood ties to the extinct House of Barby. The marriage produced eight children, of whom only three survive adulthood:[3][4] John August, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weissenfels-Barby (Dessau, 28 July 1687 - Dessau, 22 January 1688). John August, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weissenfels-Barby (Dessau, 24 July 1689 - Dessau, 21 October 1689). Stillborn twin sons (Dessau, 1690). Frederick Henry, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Weissenfels-Barby (Dessau, 2 July 1692 - The Hague, 21 November 1711). George Albert, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels-Barby (Dessau, 19 April 1695 - Barby, 12 June 1739). Henriette Marie (Dessau, 1 March 1697 - Weissenfels, 10 August 1719). Stillborn daughter (Dessau, 5 October 1706). Elisabeth Albertine died in Dessau aged 41, following complications in her last childbirth. She was buried in the Familiengruft, Barby.[5] References[edit] This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources.

The result was a victory for the incumbent Virgin Islands Party (VIP) led by Chief Minister Lavity Stoutt. The VIP won a plurality of six seats, and thus were able to form a minority government as no other party or coalition could muster a larger number of seats. The BVI United Party (UP) won three seats, and the Concerned Citizens Movement (CCM) won two seats. The two other seats were won by independents.[1] Shortly after the election Alvin Christopher joined the VIP upon being offered a Ministerial seat, giving the VIP an outright majority. It was the first election to be fought in the British Virgin Islands after the introduction of Territorial at-large seats. Lavity Stoutt had fought hard against the introduction of at-large seats, fearing it would undermine the strong territorial base of the VIP. After his victory he said: "The at-large system was a plot, a plot designed to derail H. Lavity Stoutt. Well it failed. The people have had their say. Their voice has been heard."[2] The 1995 general election also witnessed the first ever female representatives elected: Ethlyn E. Smith in the Fifth District, and Eileene Parsons as an At-large representative. Eileene Parsons would later join the ruling Virgin Islands Party and become the first ever female Minister for Government in the Territory. Former Chief Minister, Willard Wheatley ran as an independent in at the at-large seats and was resoundingly rejected by the voters, only winning slightly more votes than were recorded as spoiled ballots (265 against 232). It was the last election in the British Virgin Islands to be fought prior to the death of Lavity Stoutt. The supervisor of elections was Eugenie Todman-Smith.[3] The turnout was 68.8%.

Conversely, Willard Wheatley suffered the worst electoral defeat of his career, and would never run again. Cyril Romney was defeated for the first time since 1975, although he would run again (unsuccessfully) in 1999. Longtime legislators Oliver Cills and Terrance Lettsome were both elected, but neither would stand again after the 1995 election. Lavity Stoutt was also elected, but would die later in the same year. Andre Penn was elected for his only ever term of office; Penn would later be convicted of sexual crimes involving children and sentenced to 12 years in prison;[4] and is believed to be the only elected official in the British Virgin Islands to be subsequently convicted of an indictable offence.

Her mother and aunt frequently visited, and her father made an unsuccessful custody bid at one point.[1][11] Perez has five brothers and sisters from her mother's first marriage to Ventura Perez but also has additional half-brothers and half-sisters (a total of 10 children).[11] When she was in third grade, Perez learned that she had a speech impediment.[12] She had a strict Catholic upbringing, which she has credited to the influence of the nuns during her childhood.[9][13] She eventually moved in with paternal aunt, Ana Dominga Otero Serrano-Roque,[14] and attended Grover Cleveland High School, in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens.[15] Her mother died of AIDS-related complications in 1999.[11] Career[edit] At 19 years old,[16] Perez started her career in the early 1980s as a dancer on Soul Train. As a student at Los Angeles City College,[17] with plans to major in biochemistry,[18] she said she relieved stress by going to nightclubs for ladies' night. A talent scout from Soul Train asked Perez to appear on the show. She was not a professional dancer, but loved it so much she dropped out of school.[9] In 1988, when she was 24 years old, Perez was noticed at the dance club Funky Reggae[19] by Spike Lee, who hired her for her first major acting role in Do the Right Thing.[20] Perez later choreographed music videos by Janet Jackson, Bobby Brown, Diana Ross, LL Cool J and The Boys.[13] She was the choreographer for the dancing group the Fly Girls who were featured on the Fox television comedy program In Living Color and also worked as a segment producer.[21] She made her Broadway debut in Terrence McNally's Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune.[22] Perez had her third major role in the hit comedy White Men Can't Jump co-starring Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson. Perez was nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Peter Weir's 1993 film Fearless.[23] She attended the ceremony with her father.[24] In 1997, she co-starred with Javier Bardem in Perdita Durango, a film in which many scenes of excessive violence, sex and nudity were edited out of the version released in the United States but remained intact in the version released throughout Latin America.[25] In 1999, Perez starred in Nancy Savoca's The 24 Hour Woman.[2] She provides the voices of Click, the camera, on Nick Jr.'s Go, Diego, Go! and Chel, a beautiful native woman in the DreamWorks Animation film The Road to El Dorado. She played corrupt police officer Carol Brazier in the Judd Apatow-produced film Pineapple Express, co-starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. Perez appeared on an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in October 2009 about pedophiles' rights. Executive producer Neal Baer said the writers had Perez in mind when they wrote the role of a young sexual abuse victim's mother.[26] She injured her neck while filming the episode and underwent surgery to heal a herniated disc.[27] One year after the accident, she appeared at the White House in a wheelchair, wearing a neck brace for a meeting with President Obama.[28] In May 2011, Perez filed a lawsuit against the producers of the show,[29] claiming that the injury she incurred was the result of being "recklessly pulled, grabbed, yanked, wrenched and manhandled" during filming.[30] In June 2013, she served as the grand marshal for the international Boxing Hall of Fame parade in Canastota, New York.[31] In February 2014, Perez published an autobiography titled Handbook for an Unpredictable Life: How I Survived Sister Renata and My Crazy Mother, and Still Came Out Smiling... She is also the reader of the audio CD of this book. Perez said that she didn't initially set out to write an autobiography, but rather a book that analyzes the causes and effects of child abuse.[9] She said it wasn't until about 6 months after the book was published and she heard responses from others that she found the experience cathartic.[9] On September 3 of the same year, ABC announced Perez would join The View as a new co-host alongside moderator Whoopi Goldberg, newcomer Nicolle Wallace, and returning co-host Rosie O'Donnell.[32] The new season began on September 15, 2014.[33][34] Perez said she was initially hesitant about the job because "I didn't want to be on a show where people were just screaming at each other disrespectfully."[9] She decided to join the cast when she learned that Bill Wolff, whom she knew from The Rachel Maddow Show, was going to be the new executive producer.[9][35][36] In 2015, she returned to Broadway to star in Fish in the Dark, a play written by Larry David.[1][37] On July 8, 2015, Perez announced she would be leaving The View.[38] In 2018, in a series regular role, Perez portrayed Tracey Wolfe in the NBC musical drama television series Rise, which ran for one season.[39] She starred in the 2020 superhero film Birds of Prey, as comic book character Renee Montoya.[40][41] Perez is next set to star in the film adaptation of the children's book series Clifford the Big Red Dog.[42] Activism[edit] Perez is an activist for Puerto Rican rights: Her film Yo soy Boricua, pa'que tu lo sepas! (I'm Puerto Rican, Just So You Know!) documents her activism.[6][43] She starred in and directed the Spanish AIDS PSA campaign "Join the Fight" for Cable Positive and Kismet Films. The campaign featured actor Wilmer Valderrama, BET's Julissa Bermudez, Telenovela actor Erick Elías, singer/actress Lorena Rojas, 2006–2007 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera and actress Judy Marte. An English-language campaign was also directed by Liev Schreiber. President Barack Obama appointed her to The Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA). She was sworn in on February 2, 2010. On January 6, 2000, she was arrested for disorderly conduct in Manhattan following a rally to protest U.S. Navy air weapons training, as well as other forms of payload on the government training range owned at Vieques, an island off the coast of Puerto Rico. Perez serves as the chair of the artistic board for Urban Arts Partnership,[44] a New York City arts education nonprofit that uses arts integrated education programs to close the achievement gap. Personal life[edit] Perez suffered abuse during her childhood from both her schizophrenic mother and from the nuns at the group home. As a result, she has suffered from high anxiety, PTSD, and a form of depression called dysthymia, but with therapy it has been greatly reduced.[1][9][45] Perez married artist Eric Haze on September 15, 2013, in Las Vegas. They had decided to get married the night before while attending the Floyd Mayweather vs. Saúl Álvarez boxing match.[46] The couple slept over at the MGM Grand hotel-casino and were married in the morning. They live in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.[11] Perez was previously married to filmmaker and playwright Seth Zvi Rosenfeld but the couple divorced in 2001 after ten years of marriage.[47] Perez stated on the Pineapple Express DVD commentary that she is allergic to dairy products. She was a friend of the late rapper and actor Tupac Shakur.[45] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Film Role Notes 1989 Do the Right Thing Tina 1991 Night on Earth Angela Nominated—Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress 1992 White Men Can't Jump Gloria Clemente Nominated—Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting ActressNominated—Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress 1993 Untamed Heart Cindy Nominated—New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress (2nd place) Fearless Carla Rodrigo Berlin International Film Festival Award for Outstanding Performance (Special Mention)Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting ActressChicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting ActressDallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress (tied with Anna Paquin)Nominated—Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting RoleNominated—Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion PictureNominated—New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress (2nd place) 1994 It Could Happen to You Muriel Lang Somebody to Love Mercedes 1997 A Brother's Kiss Debbie Perdita Durango Perdita Durango Fantafestival Award for Best Actress 1999 The 24 Hour Woman Grace Santos Also ProducerNominated—ALMA Award for Outstanding Actress in a Feature FilmNominated—Black Reel Award for Best Actress 2000 The Road to El Dorado Chel Voice King of the Jungle Joanne 2001 Human Nature Louise Riding in Cars with Boys Shirley Perro 2003 From the 104th Floor Narrator Voice 2004 Exactly Angela Short 2005 All the Invisible Children Ruthie Segment "Jesus Children of America" Yo soy Boricua, pa'que tu lo sepas!

It was opened in 2000,[1] and is mostly used for football matches and serves as a second venue for the football clubs of al-Karamah SC and al-Wathba SC. Located in the Baba Amr district of the city, the stadium is able to hold up to 25,000 spectators. It was renovated in 2010.[2] During the Syrian Civil War, Baba Amr was the epicentre of fighting in the 2012 Homs offensive. As a result, the stadium was heavily damaged and the playing surface was entirely deteriorated. However, the stadium was renovated during 2016 and a new turf was installed.[3] See also[edit] List of football stadiums in Syria References[edit] ^ Bassel al-Assad Stadium in Homs ^ The second stadium in Homs upgraded to international level ^ Renovation works completed in the Bassel al-Assad Stadium in Baba Amr Coordinates: 34°42′59″N 36°41′20″E﻿ / ﻿34.71639°N 36.68889°E﻿ / 34.71639; 36.68889 This article about a Syrian sports venue is a stub.

He received the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq with the U.S. Special Forces.[3] After returning from Iraq, LaRose married Lauren Kappa and graduated from Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science in Consumer Affairs and a minor in Business Administration.[3] Ohio Senate career[edit] Ohio Senate election (2010)[edit] LaRose ran for Ohio Senate in 2010 and defeated the Democratic nominee, Summit County Councilman Frank Comunale, in the 27th District, a Democratic-leaning district.[5] LaRose edged out Comunale 56.5% to 43.5%.[6][5] Ohio Senate (2011–2013)[edit] LaRose was sworn into the Ohio Senate in 2011. Governing magazine named him one of "12 State Legislators to Watch in 2014".[7] LaRose was chair of the Ohio Senate Transportation, Commerce and Workforce Committee, and previously was chair of the State and Local Government Committee and Public Safety, Local Government and Veterans Affairs Committee. He previously was chair of the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review.[8] LaRose voted for Senate Bill 5 which reduced collective bargaining rights for public workers (including police, firefighters, and teachers).[9][10] LaRose added that he agonized over the decision.[11][12] After the bill, which passed by a narrow margin, was repealed by a public referendum, LaRose said, "The voters have made it clear that this was not the course they wished to take."[12] In 2018, LaRose said, "As I look back on [my yes vote on SB5] am I confident I did the right thing? Not necessarily."[9] LaRose voted for the Congressional Redistricting plan (HB 369)[13] that is now under legal challenge for gerrymandering.[14] LaRose voted for SB 72 in 2011, a "late-term abortion" ban, which only affects 1% of abortions,[15] and provided no exception for the mother's health.[16] This was reintroduced as HB 78, which lowered the ban from 24 to 20 weeks, but allowed for an exemption for the woman's health.[17] Ohio Senate (2014–2018)[edit] LaRose won re-election to his seat in 2014. LaRose sponsored a bill to eliminate six days of early voting (SB 238), and prohibit county Board of Elections from sending out unsolicited absentee voting applications.[18] In 2016, he voted for SB 296, introduced by Rep. Bill Seitz, which would require a monetary payment in order to extend voting hours at any vote center for any reason.[19] As of 2014, LaRose had supported five major abortion restriction laws.[20][better source needed] However, anti-abortion advocacy group Ohio Right to Life endorsed his opponent in the 2014 Republican primary.[21][22] Larose deleted anti-abortion webpage In 2016, his legislative aide, Jessica Koehler, joined Ohio's Right to Life as the Director of Legislative Affairs.[23] In 2015, Larose voted for SB 127, a 20-week abortion ban, and cosponsored HB 294, which prohibited public funds for abortion services. In 2016, Larose supported HB 493, a heartbeat bill, even though similar bills have been unanimously blocked by the judiciary in several states.[24] In 2017, he voted for SB 28, which would require the burial or cremation of fetal remains, identical to a similar bill which has been blocked in Texas.[25] In 2017, he sponsored legislation to prevent women from having abortions after a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome.[26] He also voted for SB 145, which bans certain abortion procedures. The American Conservative Union gave him a 100% evaluation for 2017.[citation needed] Ohio Secretary of State[edit] Candidacy for Secretary of State (2018)[edit] On May 17, 2017, LaRose announced that he would run for Ohio Secretary of State in the 2018 election. LaRose defeated Democratic State Rep. Kathleen Clyde in the general election 50.9% to 46.7%.[27] Early during the campaign, LaRose indicated that he would continue a policy of purging voters from voter rolls if those voters had not voted for six consecutive years.[28] Later during the campaign, LaRose said that he did not support the policy.[29] In 2016, LaRose opposed automatic voter registration, but said during the campaign that he supported automatic voter registration.[29] While in Ohio Senate, LaRose sponsored legislation to eliminate Ohio's "Golden Week" (a five-day period when Ohioans could register and vote on the same day); during the 2018 campaign, LaRose said he favored a different same-day registration system.[29] During the campaign, Clyde supported a shift to a uniform paper ballot system in Ohio; LaRose said he favored the current system where there is a requirement for a paper trail for ballots but all counties are allowed to use their own machines.[30] Clyde called for the adoption of postal voting to replace early in-person voting; LaRose supported the existing system which is a combination of early in-person voting and postal voting.[30] Ohio's Secretary of State (2019–present)[edit] On January 12, 2019, LaRose was sworn in to serve as Ohio's 51st Secretary of State, a four-year term.[31] He was the "first Summit County resident elected Ohio secretary of state in about 166 years."[32] LaRose's offices are in the Continental Plaza high-rise in downtown Columbus.[33] In April 2019, he observed the Ukrainian presidential election.[34] He was promoting simplifying the voter roll purging process in May 2019.[35] He was also seeking automated voter registration,[36] stating he was crafting an election reform bill on the issue.[37] In June 2019, he ordered county boards of elections to undergo security upgrades for the 2020 election.[38] As the top election official in Ohio, in September 2019, LaRose had spent "months working on a project to purge Ohio’s inactive voters while also trying to address long-standing criticisms of the controversial process."[39] He was urged to halt a purge of inactive voters by Democrats over errors, but he defended the purge.[40] In September 2019, his office was reviewing Ohio voter registrations that might have been incorrectly deleted in vendor errors, with Democrats suing.[41] Also in 2019, LaRose defended Ohio's congressional districts, opposed by Democrats for being gerrymandered to favor the Republican representatives in power.[42] In September 2019, he was released from a February 2019 lawsuit filed by members of environmental activist groups, who "accused elections officials of using unconstitutional tactics that kept certain initiatives from going before voters."[43] That month, he also claimed that Ohio had the most secure elections in the United States.[44]On September 19, 2019, he said he was in the process of distributing $12.8 million Election Assistance Commission funds.[45] On October 9, 2019, the Ohio Senate unanimously approved Senate Bill 52, which among other reasons, made LaRose a member of Ohio’s Homeland Security Advisory Council.[46] Personal life[edit] According to his official biography, LaRose lives in Hudson, Ohio with his wife, Lauren and their three daughters.[3] According to his official biography, LaRose is a board member of the Ohio Historical Society; Junior Vice Commander of the Fairlawn Veterans of Foreign Wars; and a member of the executive board for the Great Trail Council, Boy Scouts of America.[3] References[edit] ^ "Frank LaRose LinkedIn".

They probably belonged to the Siouan-Catawba language family. First encountered by the Spanish in 1567 in western North Carolina, they migrated to the southeast by 1700, where English colonists noted them. They had settled along the Wateree River near what has become present-day Camden, South Carolina. Originally a large tribe, they were diminished by the Yamasee War of 1715 and became extinct as a tribe by the end of the century. Contents 1 Language and name 2 16th- and 17th-century history 3 18th-century history 4 Notes 5 References Language and name[edit] The name Wateree may come from Catawban wateran, "to float on the water"[1] or from yeh is-WAH h’reh, meaning “people of the [Wateree] river". 16th- and 17th-century history[edit] They were recorded in 1567 by Spanish captain Juan Pardo's scribe Juan de la Bandera during their expedition through the interior of the Carolinas.[1] Bandera called them the Guatari in his journal, which was also given as the name of their village.[2] Bandera described them as ruled by two female chiefs.[1] The Spaniards noted that Guatari was far from the coast. The settlement is believed to have been in present-day Rowan County, North Carolina. In 1670, English colonists and explorers mentioned the Wateree as inhabiting the area of the upper Yadkin River, to the northwest of their later habitat. 18th-century history[edit] A c. 1724 English copy of a deerskin Catawba map of the tribes between Charleston (left) and Virginia (right) following the displacements of a century of disease and enslavement and the 1715–7 Yamasee War. The Wateree are labelled as "Waterie". By 1700, when observed by John Lawson's expedition, the Wateree had migrated south to settle near present-day Camden, South Carolina along the Wateree River.[1] The British observed that the chiefs of the Wateree had a higher degree of power than those of other Indian tribes of the region. Originally a large tribe, the Wateree had their power broken during the Yamasee War of 1715 against Carolina colonists. The Wateree became allies in a tribal confederation dominated by the Catawba. The latter tribe absorbed remnant bands of many other tribes of the region from the chaos of intertribal fighting.[1] "James Adair heard more than twenty different languages spoken by the Indians in the Catawba River settlements when he trade there between 1736 and 1743. This included Eno, Cheraw, Wateree, Congaree, Natchez, Yamasee, Coosah, and others. He could probably have added Saponi, Waccamaw, Pedee, Santee and others to his list. The groups varied in size. If large enough, each language tribe tended to create its own village and appoint its own leaders." [3] The Wateree appeared to have been able to maintain their culture and distinct language as late as 1744. A record of land sale noted that Wateree Indians sold to a white man. The tribe as a group culture has become extinct, but some present-day Catawba are likely genetic descendants of the Wateree.

It was co-written with Kathleen Gleeson. The book tells the story of Bardach's transformation from placid student in pre-war Poland, to a Communist convert after the Soviet Union's bisecting of the country with Germany, and then follows him through his trial for treason and sentence of forced labor in the camps in the Kolyma region of Siberia. Throughout, Bardach's accounts show the sacrifice, toil, and luck necessary to survive in a Stalinist-era labor camp. Prologue[edit] The memoir opens in Poland in July 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Bardach, a member of a tank crew, is digging his own grave in anticipation of his execution for treason. During the war, treason was an all-encompassing offense that could be applied to a litany of offenses, ranging from something as small as dereliction of duty. In Bardach's case, he was charged with treason for the belief that he intentionally wrecked his tank, when in fact it was simply rendered inoperable while fording a river. Bound and thrust into his self-made grave, Bardach waits for the impending shot, all the while wondering how it was that he had come to this place. "The night and earth and sleep and death had merged. All felt the same." Reviews[edit] In so far as Man Is Wolf to Man is the story of man's brutality to man, popular criticism tended to compare it favorably to similar historical works, most notably Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, while at the same time pointing toward its ultimately uplifting tale, not only of man's ability to survive, but also to assist others when seemingly at their worst. Perhaps most damning is Bardach's transformation from earnest Communist sympathizer to witness to its greatest atrocities. Paul Goldberg said in the New York Times, "Man Is Wolf to Man presents an eloquent account of Bardach's transition from naivete to wisdom."[2] References[edit] ^ Bardach, Janusz; Gleeson, Kathleen (1999).

Star Paving Company, 51 Cal. 2d 409 (1958), was a California Supreme Court case in which the court held that a party who has detrimentally relied on an offer that is revoked prior to acceptance may assert promissory estoppel to recover damages.[1] Contents 1 Background 2 Opinion of the Court 3 Impact 4 References 5 External links Background[edit] William A. Drennan, a general contractor, had gotten a bid from Star Paving, a subcontractor for a construction job and had included Star Paving's bid number in his total bid. Drennan won the contract to build the Monte Vista Elementary School for the Lancaster School District based on that bid. Subsequently, Star Paving contacted him to say that its initial bid had been approximately $7000 short, and that it would not be able to complete the project for the amount of money it had previously specified. After finding an alternative subcontractor to complete the job, Drennan sued Star Paving for the difference between its bid and the cost. Opinion of the Court[edit] Judge Roger J. Traynor, writing for the California Supreme Court, held that the plaintiff's reliance on defendant's bid, as well as defendant's failure to indicate that the bid was revocable before acceptance, meant that defendant was responsible for providing the service at the price initially specified. Impact[edit] In contracts courses this case is often contrasted with James Baird Co. v. Gimbel Bros., a 1933 case with similar facts from the Second Circuit decided by Judge Learned Hand. Hand held that an offeror was free to revoke the offer prior to acceptance; twenty-five years later, when the doctrine of promissory estoppel had found wider acceptance, Traynor held that the offer was irrevocable once the offeree had relied upon it.[2] References[edit] ^ Drennan v.

He trained as a lawyer and became a judge. He accompanied James VI to Denmark, and gave money to the skipper of the Scottish ships when the king visited the dockyard at Copenhagen on 3 March 1590.[2] In November 1591 he was elected a Senator of the College of Justice being elected at the same time as Andrew Wemyss, Lord Myrecairnie.[3] In 1591 Cockburn was admitted as a Lord of Session.[1] He was the Secretary of State to James VI from 1591 to 1596. In this capacity he was directly involved in the private communications between James and Queen Elizabeth I in the final years of the queen's reign. On 15 September 1594 he was in London where he met the queen and kissed her hand. He was accompanied by James Bellenden and George Douglas of Longniddry, a servant of Anne of Denmark.[4] On 12 November 1594 Robert Cecil gave him a letter from the queen to carry back to James VI.[5] He was given £2,000 as a gift for James VI.[6] Elizabeth let it be known that the money should be taken to Scotland, and not spent in London, as had happened in previous years.[7] He passed £680 Scots from this sum to the goldsmith and royal financier Thomas Foulis for the king's use.[8] The rest of the money was sent to the Duke of Lennox for the wages of his soldiers in the north of Scotland.[9] The cost of Cockburn's embassy was met with £1,000 Scots from the Danish dowry, which had been invested with the town council of Haddington.[10] In 1595 Cockburn's trip to England to see the queen is mentioned in a letter from James to Elizabeth.[11] In July the Chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane wrote to the Earl of Essex, about their future "diligent intercourse of intelligence" involving Cockburn and Anthony Bacon. Essex replied that he wrote only with the queen's knowledge, and they would be happy to receive letters from Maitland or Cockburn.[12] In May 1596 Sir Richard was replaced as Secretary of State by John Lindsay of Balcarres, one of the eight Octavians who were appointed by James in January of that same year as commissioners to reform the financial processes of the Scottish government.[13] On 14 November he returned to the Privy Council the original signed copy of a letter which Elizabeth had written on 2 June 1586, offering annual gifts of money for the king's expenses.[14] In 1598 Sir Richard regained the office of Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, a position that had been taken over temporarily by John Lindsay. In 1610 he was confirmed as a member in the new Privy Council and at the same time appointed to the Court of High Commission for church affairs. But in February 1626 he was removed from the bench as a result of the resolution by the new king, Charles I, that no noblemen nor officers of the state be simultaneously members of the judiciary.[1] He died in October 1627 in Haddington.[15] Family[edit] In about 1611 Sir Richard married his distant cousin, Margaret Cockburn, the daughter of Sir William Cockburn of Langton. The Cockburns were an important land-owning family in the Scottish Lowlands since the early part of the 14th century. The marriage brought together the wealthy Langton and politically influential Clerkington branches of that family. Sir Richard and Margaret had a daughter, born in March 1612 in Edinburgh; a son Patrick, born in March 1613 who died in infancy; and a second son Patrick who was born in November 1614. Sir Richard was succeeded as Laird of Clerkington by his son Patrick.[15][16] Church records confirm that Sir Richard had at least seven illegitimate children, all born in Edinburgh, with one or more unrecorded women. Jeane was born in April 1599. Anna was born in March 1604. Johne was born in April 1605. Helene was born in December 1606. Richard was born in July 1608. William was born in August 1609. Issobel was born in December 1610. In 1620 Jeane married James Pringle, the 5th Laird of Torwoodlee.

They are known for their ecological significance.[1] Many conservationists have played a role in preserving parts of the Indiana Dunes.[1][2] The Hour Glass, a museum in Ogden Dunes, showcases some of the ecological import of the Dunes.[3] Human presences in the Indiana Dunes have existed since the retreat of the glaciers some 14,000 years ago. The southern lakes area was a rich hunting ground and there is little evidence of permanent communities forming during the earlier years. Archeological evidence is consistent with seasonal hunting camps. The earliest evidence for permanent camps is consistent with the Hopewellian occupation of the Ohio valley. Five groups of mounds have been documented in the dunes area. These mounds would be consistent with the period of 200 BCE (Goodall Focus) to 800 CE (early Mississippian).[4] The advent of European exploration and trade introduced more changes to the human environment. Tribal animosities and traditional European competition affected tribal relations. Entire populations began moving westward, while others sought to dominate large geographic trading areas. Once again the dunes became a middle point on a journey from the east or the west. It continued to remain a key hunting ground for villages over a wide area. It wasn't until the 19th century that native villages once again were scattered through the area, but this was soon followed by European settlement. Today, the entire coast line has been settled and filled with homes, factories, businesses and public parks.

As the glaciers receded, people began to move into the area. The earliest people recorded in Indiana are the Early Paleoindians. No sites have been found in the dunes. During the period of this cultural group, the dunes area had just emerged from beneath the continental glaciers. The landscape was not conducive to the existence of the animals upon which the Early Paleoindian culture depended.[5] A few scattered Late Paleoindian artifacts have been found on the higher and older ridges in the dunes.[5] projectile points from INDU (see also Lynott et al. 1998) [5]Multiple locations within the dunes have yielded artifacts from the archaic traditions. Included are Early Archaic Lecroy or Kanawha bifurcate-stemmed point (7800 and 5800 BC), Greenville Creek side notched. Also documented are four sites with projectile points that are the Middle to Late Archaic points found in the Great Lakes area.[5] ID Culture-historic type and period Date range References A Jack's Reef Pentagonal AD 500–1000 Justice 1987:215–217 B Triangle cluster (Late Prehistoric) AD 800-Historic Justice 1987:224–226 C Triangular cluster (Late Prehistoric) AD 800-Historic Justice 1987:224–226 D Triangular cluster (Late Prehistoric) AD 800-Historic Justice 1987:224–226 F Dehli Barbed (Late Archaic- Early Woodland) or Affinis Snyders (Middle Woodland) 1300–200 BC or 200 BC –AD 200 Justice 1987:179; DeRagnaucourt 1991:234–238 H Lamoka or Brewerton Side-notched (Late Archaic) 3000–1700 BC DeRegnaucourt 1991:150–166 J Palmer Corner-notched (Early Archaic) 7500–6900 BC DeRegnaucourt 1991:44–48 K Kirk Stemmed (Early Archaic) 6900–6000 BC Justice 1987:82–85 L Thebes Cluster (Early Archaic) or Big Sandy Side-notched (Middle Archaic) 8000–7000 BC or 6000–4000 BC Justice 1987:54–56; DeRegnaucourt 1991:117–123, 131 M Big Sandy?

As such, there are no glacial kames in the dunes area. With the lack of glacial kames to locate burials, it is only the projectile points that are usable for rough dating. Simultaneous with the Glacial Kame people, the Red Ocher people and the Old Copper Culture. Like the Glacial Kame culture, these other groups are identified by their burial goods. The centers of the Red Ocher and Old Copper Culture are further from the Indiana Dunes and no artifacts have been identified as being from any of these three cultural groups.[5] The earliest signs of long-term or permanent habitation are the mounds that exist across northwest Indiana. While undated, many are placed in the cultural group that has become known as the Goodall Focus[6] The Goodall Focus is a cultural grouping of the Hopewell Culture. The dunes are the far western and most southern expression of Goodall sites. The group is centered in western Michigan along the Grand, Kalamazoo and Galien Rivers.[7] The mounds located in the dunes are represented by six sites. Type Findings Status Burial[4] Two burial sites have been examined. The graveyard blow-out in the Indiana Dunes State Park revealed a skull and a vertebra with an arrow lodge in it. The second site included seven complete skeletons. Located near the Petit fort the first site has eroded away. The second burial site was discovered as Wagner Road was extended northward and has been fully excavated. Camp Site [4] The first campsite located was near Tremont, just north of Highway 12. Many flint chips and fire-cracked stones were found. The second campsite was reported on a high elevation on both sides of the Calumet River, north of Porter. High points were dry areas for overnight use. No relics were found at either site during the 1931 field examinations. The second site showed no signs of human habitation. "Indian" Well[4] Located north of Chesterton was a spring. It was said to be the site for large gatherings. By 1931, it had been filled in. Mound Valley[4] In 1923, there were nearly 100 mounds.[8] There were round mounds of 20 feet (6.1 m) to 50 feet (15 m) across and 6 feet (1.8 m) to 10 feet (3.0 m) tall. Other elliptical mounds were 10 feet (3.0 m) to 40 feet (12 m) long. Excavations found stone knives, hammers, and projectile points. Steel blades with bone handles were also discovered, but could not be saved. By 1931, no evidence remained of any of these mounds. By the 15th century CE, the communities of Native American surrounding the southern shores of Lake Michigan were of the Huber-Berrien group. These were a mound builder associated people, contemporary to the Fort Ancient communities of the Ohio River valley [9] Major classification Cultural group Related major cultural group Time period Clovis culture Paleo-Indians 18000 BCE – 8000 BCE Early Archaic Glacial Kame Culture – (8000 BCE to 1000 BCE) Red Ocher people 8000 BCE – 6000 BCE Middle Archaic Glacial Kame Culture – (8000 BCE to 1000 BCE) Red Ocher people 6000 BCE – 3000 BCE Old Copper Complex aka Late Archaic Glacial Kame Culture – (8000 BCE to 1000 BCE) Red Ocher people 4000 BCE to 1000 BCE Early Woodland period Adena culture 1000 BCE to 200 CE Middle Woodland period Goodall Focus Hopewell tradition 200 BCE to 500 CE Late Woodland period or Fort Ancient Oneota Mississippian culture 800 CE to 1500 CE Historic Miami Woodland c 1673 along the St. Joseph River of Lake Michigan Historic Potawatomi Woodland c 1780s to 1838 Historic Native American communities[edit] Iroquois Wars or Beaver Wars[edit] The legends of the Potawatomi and Miami peoples place them in the Indiana Dunes prior to the Iroquois War or Beaver Wars (1641–1701). It was during the war period that both nations migrated north to the Door Peninsula with many other tribes for protection.[9] The Iroquois War centered in the lower peninsula of modern Ontario, Canada, north of Lakes Erie and Ontario. The early stages of the Iroquois Wars were among the Erie Indians on the southern shore of Lake Erie. By 1656 the tribe had been destroyed or dispersed.[10] Most of the Iroquois War is taken from the French records in Canada, leaving little details on activities further west and south of the lakes. By 1677, the Miami and Potawatomi had begun to return to the southern shore of Lake Michigan. The Miami were at the western bend of the Calumet River (Blue Island, Illinois).[9] On the far eastern edge of the dunes, the Miami and Mascouten had returned to the St. Joseph River of Lake Michigan sometime after 1673. Another village grew at the portage from the South Bend of the St. Joseph after 1679.[9] Additional villages may have been located through the dunes by this time, but there are no mention of any villages in the journals of René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.[9] The Iroquois raided the Illinois Confederation village at Fort St. Louis, or Starved Rock, in 1684. Then in 1687, the Iroquois raided the villages in Blue Island area. No further incursion passed around the south end of Lake Michigan. By the late 1680s, the allied Algonquian peoples had taken the war east to the Iroquois homeland, bringing an end to the Iroquois threat.[9] By 1701, the eastern villages along the St. Joseph and expanded to include not only Miami and Mascouten, but Shawnee, Mahican, and Potawatomi. The only other identified community was over a hundred miles (106 km) south at Ouiatenon on the Wabash River. French era[edit] During the French Era of presences in the Indiana Dunes (1720–1761), primary villages were located at the mouth of the Chicago River and the northern reach of the St. Joseph River (from modern South Bend, Indiana, to Niles, Michigan). The French authorities in Montreal encouraged licensed traders to winter in native villages. This had the effect of concentrating communities at key travel points.[9] The Indiana Dunes were, at best, an area of passage. The nearest key points were the Chicago Portage to the west and the St. Joseph Portage to the east. The Mesquakie, Sauk, established villages at Chicago in the 1740s. The Potawatomi are reported around the French trading post at Chicago beginning in the 1750s. On the east, the Potawatomi and Miami developed villages on the St. Joseph River downstream from the Kankakee and St. Joseph portage after 1720.[9] During this time, the dunes would have been seasonal hunting grounds. Exploration[edit] Like the American Indian 'occupation' of the Indiana Dunes, exploration by Europeans swirled around the southern shore of Lake Michigan, rather than through the heart of the dunes. The French quickly 'discovered' or were told of the water routes that passed from the south side of Lake Michigan to places further south. The two primary routes were by the Chicago Portage in Illinois or by the portage between the St. Joseph River and the Kankakee River in northern Indiana. Year Event 1666 Jesuit missionaries, Frs. Allouez, Marquette, Dablon begin to come through area. 1674 Father Marquette pauses on way north, shortly before his death. 1679 LaSalle and Tonti pass through; establish base near St. Joseph. 1750 Little Fort is built by French near site of present Dune State Park 1780 Little Fort abandoned by English; Tom Bradley in the "Battle of the Dunes." Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette 1673 sent by Jean Talon intendant of New France. Promised to return and establish a mission among the Illinois.[11] This journey was along the western shore of Lake Michigan to the Chicago Portage. In October 1674, Father Jacques Marquette, with Pierre Porteret and Jacques Largilliers,[11] left the mission of St. Francis Xavier in Green Bay. Because of illness, the party spent the winter at the Chicago Portage. By Easter in April 1675, the party was on the Illinois River, south of modern Ottawa, Illinois. Here, he is said to have preached to 1500 Indians. When Marquette, once again became ill, he requested to return to Michilimackinac in the Straits of Mackinac. This time, instead of following the western border of Lake Michigan, they choose to follow the shorter route across the southern shore and up the eastern shore. Petit Fort Early trails[edit] Known by many names and by many routes, the trails through the dunes sought out the easiest routes. The first evidence of trails comes from Joseph Bailly in 1822, when he settled south of the Calumet Beach Trail.[12] This route has also been referred to as the Lake Shore Trail. It had first come to the notice of the American government after the War of 1812. The U.S. government sought to establish a trail military road from Fort Ponchartrain du Detroit to Fort Dearborn, now in Chicago. It was not until 1827 that the route was identified and in use. It followed the Great Sauk Trail from Detroit to modern LaPorte, Indiana. Here the traveler had two options. The primary road continued to follow the Sauk Trail across Indiana through Porter and Lake Counties to Illinois. The other option was to go northwest to Trail Creek and follow the lake shore the last 60 miles (97 km) to Fort Dearborn. The military road became known as the Chicago Road.[13] By 1833, regular stagecoach service was provided between Detroit and Chicago.[14] See also Michigan Road – Madison (Ohio River), Indianapolis, South Bend, Michigan City U.S. Route 12 in Indiana Fur trade and settlement[edit] Date Event[15] Where primary sources are known, references are shown in the table 1803 Lt.

Leman builds the first "permanent" summer cottage in the Dunes proper. 1896 Octave Chanute begins his glider experiments at Miller, later moving to Dune Park. 1897 Frank Morley Woodruff published the first of many papers on the birds of the Dunes. 1899 Henry Chandler Cowles' classic work on the ecological relations of the vegetation of the sand dunes is published. Octave Chanute organized the International Conference on Aerial Navigation in 1893, during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. From there, in conjunction with his contacts in Europe, he joined with younger experimenters, including Augustus Herring and William Avery. In 1896 and 1897 they tested hang gliders based on designs by German aviator Otto Lilienthal. They also tested their own hang glider design. To make use of the steady winds, they came to the town of Miller Beach on the shores of Lake Michigan. The location is today in Marquette Park. These experiments convinced Chanute and his partners that the way to achieve the extra lift needed without a lot of weight was to place stack several wings one above the other. The idea was originally proposed by British engineer Francis Wenham in 1866 and tested by Lilienthal in the 1890s. Chanute invented the "strut-wire" braced wing structure to hold the several wings together, which became the standard design in powered biplanes. The Strut wire design came from Chanutes bridge designs using the Pratt truss. The Wright brothers, based their Flyer designs on the Chanute "double-decker".[17] In 1874, Robert and Druisilla Carr settled on 200 acres (81 ha) of land at the mouth of the Calumet River. During this period, the dunes became the site of hang gliding experiments carried out in 1896–1897 by aeronaut Octave Chanute. Although the Carrs had lived on the land for years, United States Steel Corporation claimed ownership in 1919. After years of negotiations, U.S.Steel and the estate of the Carrs agreed to the donation of the land to the City of Gary for a park.[18] Originally dedicated as "Lake Front Park", it was renamed in honor of Father Pere Marquette.

Knotts, president, Mrs. Frank J. Sheehan, secretary. Director of the National Park Service Mather calls meeting in Chicago for Dunes National Park project with overwhelming sentiment in favor of it. World War I prevents its realization. 1919 Marquette Park is established. 1925 Indiana Dunes State Park is established. 1966 Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore established (P.L. 89-761). In June 1954, the Army Corps of Engineers purchased a vacant site, east of Ogden Dunes. By the end of the year, a contract was awarded to construct a $1,000,000 Nike-Ajax guided missile base. Two tracts of land, totaling 40 acres (160,000 m2), were developed for a component of the 9th AAA Guided Missile Battalion. As the most easterly facility in the 15-unit Chicago-Milwaukee Defense system, it was designed for the protection of the Gary industrial district from attack from enemy bombers.[19] The facility included three underground storage structures for missiles located on the eastern site. A half-mile (0.3 km) west, the administrative headquarters facility was constructed with nine buildings, including mess halls, barracks, and administration offices, recreation, generators, storage, and smaller buildings.[19] The facility was shut down in April 1974 and transferred to the National Park Service. It was rehabilitated in 1977 as the administrative offices of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.[20] Twenty-first century[edit] Date Event Where primary sources are known, references are shown in the table 2019 The United States Congress retitled the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as the Indiana Dunes National Park as established by House Joint Resolution 31, which also redesignated Miller Woods Trail as the Paul H. Douglas Trail.[21] Park creation[edit] Early preservation[edit] The legislation that authorized Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in 1966 resulted from a movement that began in 1899. Three key individuals helped make Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore a reality: Henry Cowles, a botanist from the University of Chicago; Paul H. Douglas, U.S. senator for the State of Illinois; and Dorothy R. Buell, an Ogden Dunes resident and English teacher. Henry Cowles published an article entitled "Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan" in the Botanical Gazette in 1899 that established Cowles as the "father of plant ecology" in North America and brought international attention to the intricate ecosystems existing on the dunes.[22] But Cowles' article and the new international awareness were not enough to curtail the struggle between industry and preservation that governed the development of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. In 1916, the region was booming with industry in the form of steel mills and power plants. Hoosier Slide, for example, 200 feet (61 m) in height, was the largest sand dune on Indiana's lakeshore. During the first twenty years of the battle to Save the Dunes, the Ball brothers of Muncie, Indiana, manufacturers of glass fruit jars, and the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company of Kokomo carried Hoosier Slide away in railroad boxcars.[22] It was this kind of activity by local industry that spurred Cowles, along with Thomas W. Allinson and Jens Jensen, to form the Prairie Club of Chicago in 1908. The Prairie Club was the first group to propose that a portion of the Indiana Dunes be protected from commercial interests and maintained in its pristine condition for the enjoyment of the people. Out of the Prairie Club of Chicago came the precursor to the current park: The National Dunes Park Association (NDPA). The NDPA promoted the theme: "A National Park for the Middle West, and all the Middle West for a National Park." [22] Creation of Marquette Park[edit] Mather visits the Indiana Dunes Date Event[23] 1916 Director Stephen Mather of the National Park Service visits the dunes. 1919 U.S. Steel Corporation donated the lakeshore to the City of Gary for a park. (ownership was in question) 1921 Aquatorium opens 1924 Marquette Park Pavilion opens On October 30, 1916, only one month after the National Park Service itself was established (August 25, 1916), Stephen Mather, the Service's first Director, (shown at the far left in the adjacent photo leading a tour of park advocates in the dunes in 1916) held hearings in Chicago to gauge public sentiment on a "Sand Dunes National Park". Four hundred people attended and 42 people, including Henry Cowles, spoke in favor of the park proposal; there were no opponents. The battle for a national park was crippled, however, when the United States entered the First World War. National priorities changed and revenues were targeted for national defense, not the development of a national park. The popular slogan "Save the Dunes!" became "First Save the Country, Then Save the Dunes!" As the nation went from a world war into a depression, hopes to save the dunes began to fade.[22] Creation of the state park[edit] Date Event[23] 1926 Indiana Dunes State Park opens bef 1930 Pavilion opens[24] bef 1935 Dunes Arcade Hotel opens on the beach[25] In 1926, after a ten-year petition by the State of Indiana to preserve the dunes, the Indiana Dunes State Park opened to the public. The State Park was still relatively small in size and scope and the push for a national park continued. In 1949, Dorothy Buell became involved with the Indiana Dunes Preservation Council (IDPC). The efforts of Buell resulted in a Save the Dunes Council in 1952.[22] However, the struggle did not end there. A union of politicians and businessmen desired to maximize economic development by obtaining federal funds to construct a Port of Indiana. Hoosier politicians and businessmen were eager to exploit the economic prosperity promised by linking the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes via the St. Lawrence Seaway. In light of this, Save the Dunes Council President Dorothy Buell and council members began a nationwide membership and fundraising drive to buy the land they desperately sought to preserve. Their first success was the purchase of 56 acres (230,000 m2) in Porter County, the Cowles Tamarack Bog.[22] Creation of the national lakeshore[edit] Date Event[23] 1968 West Beach acquired. 1970 James R. Whitehouse, First Superintendent at Indiana Dunes Nat'l Lakeshore. 1972 Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore dedicated by official ceremony. 1974 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) constructed first beach nourishment at Mt. Baldy (total 227,000 cubic yards (174,000 m3) or 305,100 tons[vague]). Also rebuilt portions of Lake Front Drive and constructed the Beverly Shores rock revetment. Total cost $3.1 million. 1976 Restoration of Bailly Homestead begins. Congress passed legislation expanding lakeshore boundaries (something to illustrate 4 expansion bills with photos of lands acquired—e.g. Miller Woods) primarily in the West Unit and Heron Rookery (P.L. 94-549). 1977 Nike Base is transformed into park headquarters. West Beach bathhouse, parking area and entrance road opened. 1979 Bailly Cemetery renovated. Bailly Administrative Area headquarters renovated; headquarters staff moves from Visitor Center. 1980 Congress passed legislation further expanding park, principally to accommodate redevelopment plans (P.L. 96-612) 1981 USACOE constructed 2nd beach nourishment at Mt. Baldy (80,000 cu yd (61,000 m3) or 108,000 tons[vague]). 1983 Dale B. Engquist becomes second Superintendent at national lakeshore. 1986 Paul H. Douglas Center for Environmental Education dedicated and opened for public September 14. 1989 Construction completed on new Lake View facility that opened for public use for the summer. Facility included restrooms, picnic area, Lake Michigan exhibits and beach access. Interior restoration of the first floor of the main house of the Chellberg Farm was completed and the facility opened for public use for the first time during the Duneland Harvest Festival in September. 1992 Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was officially dedicated in honor of Senator Paul H. Douglas by Senator Paul Simon of Illinois 1993 The park's visitor center was officially dedicated as the "Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center" in recognition of Mrs. Buell's contributions to the establishment of the national lakeshore. 1995 The Dunewood Campground registration building was completed in June and was opened for campers. 1996 USACOE constructed third Mt. Baldy beach nourishment (53,000 cu yd or 41,000 m3). Cost – $1.3 million. In addition, 50,000 cu yd (38,000 m3) were placed by pipeline from hydraulic dredging of the outer harbor at Michigan City ($321,000). 1998 The first phase of construction of the IDELC at Camp Good Fellow was opened for use in October. The first phase consisted of 5 cabins and a multipurpose building. Five more cabins were to be added to use by spring, 1999. 2003 Historic Sears catalog (aka Larson) house rehabilitated for the Great Lakes Research & Education Center In the summer of 1961, those fighting to save the dunes began to see greater possibilities for hope. Then President John F. Kennedy supported congressional authorization for Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts, which marked the first time federal monies would be used to purchase natural parkland. President Kennedy also took a stand on the National Lakeshore, outlining a program to link the nation's economic vitality to a movement for conservation of the natural environment. This program became known as the Kennedy Compromise, 1963–1964.[22] The Kennedy Compromise entailed the creation of a national lakeshore and a port to satisfy industrial needs. Then Illinois Senator Paul H. Douglas spoke tirelessly to the public and Congress in a drive to save the dunes, earning him the title of "the third senator from Indiana." In 1966, Douglas made sure that the highly desired Burns Waterway Harbor (Port of Indiana) could only come with the authorization of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.[22] By the time the 89th Congress adjourned in late 1966, the bill had passed and the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore finally became a reality. While the 1966 authorizing legislation included only 8,330 acres (33.7 km2) of land and water, the Save the Dunes Council, National Park Service, and others continued to seek expansion of the boundaries of preservation. Four subsequent expansion bills for the park (1976, 1980, 1986, and 1992) have increased the size of the park to more than 15,000 acres (61 km2).[22] See also[edit] Chanute Aquatorium References[edit] ^ a b Smith, S. & Mark, S.

Class 3000[edit] Main article: NIR Class 3000 The Class 3000 was the first new train type purchased by NIR for two decades, to replace the increasingly obsolete NIR Class 80 units that had been in service since the mid-1970s.[1] The £80m order, the largest in NIR's history at that point, was signed in 2002, with the first unit delivered in 2004. The 23 three-car units enabled NIR to withdraw most Class 80 units. It is the main passenger train type in Northern Ireland, and operates on most routes. The first six units have CAWS to allow operation in the Republic of Ireland. Class 4000[edit] Main article: NIR Class 4000 The Class 4000 is a follow-on from the C3K. Purchased in 2009, with the first unit delivered in 2011, the 20 three-car units replaced the 13 remaining Class 80 and Class 450 sets, allowing for major service enhancements.[2] NI Railways has an option to purchase 20 trailers to lengthen the units to four cars. Republic of Ireland[edit] 29000 Class[edit] Main article: IE 29000 Class The 29000 Class is the primary commuter train type operated by Iarnród Éireann, the state rail operator in the Republic of Ireland. Originally Class 2900, they are four-car units primarily used on commuter services around Dublin. The first batch of 20 units was delivered in 2002–2003, a further nine in 2005. New Zealand[edit] AM class[edit] Main article: New Zealand AM class electric multiple unit The 57 Auckland three-car AM class EMUs carry 373 passengers, and were delivered between 2013 and 2015.

Its mission statement: "NZSTI is a nationally representative body of translators and interpreters that provides a networking forum for its members, represents members' interests, and promotes continued professional development, quality standards and awareness of the profession within government agencies and the wider community.[1]". NZSTI is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT) and has a close relationship with SLIANZ, the Sign Language Interpreters Association of New Zealand (which has its own seat on the NZSTI National Council). Contents 1 History 2 Membership 3 References 4 External links History[edit] NZSTI was established in 1985 and has three regional branches in the three main centres of New Zealand: Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. As well as an annual conference (to be held in Wellington in 2009), the branches hold regular activities through the year to support local members. Membership[edit] NZSTI has seven categories of membership: "member" (or "ordinary member"), "affiliate", "observer", "fellow", "retired member", "honorary member" and "foreign member". An online directory is available with a search function by name, by language combinations and by mode (whether a translator or interpreter).

Stage 12[edit] 11 September 2009 — Almería to Alto de Velefique, 174 km Coming out of the second rest day, the peloton gets a course with over 3,500 meters in total climbing. It includes two visits to the Alto de Velefique, one coming after 55 km and the other at the finish line. There is another first and a third-category climb on the day.[1][2] Stage 12 results Rider Team Time 1 Ryder Hesjedal (CAN) Garmin–Slipstream 5h 34' 31" 2 David Garcia (ESP) Xacobeo–Galicia + 1" 3 Robert Gesink (NED) Rabobank + 6" 4 Ezequiel Mosquera (ESP) Xacobeo–Galicia s.t. 5 Damiano Cunego (ITA) Lampre–NGC + 16" 6 Alejandro Valverde (ESP) Caisse d'Epargne s.t. 7 Cadel Evans (AUS) Silence–Lotto s.t. 8 Ivan Basso (ITA) Liquigas s.t. 9 Tom Danielson (USA) Garmin–Slipstream s.t. 10 Samuel Sánchez (ESP) Euskaltel–Euskadi s.t.

The special-category Alto de Sierra Nevada at the finish is, at 2,520 metres, the highest point reached in the race. But it is far from all this course has to offer - the deceptively difficult and steep third-category Alto de Berja comes almost immediately and is followed by the first-category Puerto de la Ragua. The Vuelta has never before gone over the Puerto de la Ragua from this side, and it is more difficult than climbing it from the opposite side. Another first-category climb, the Alto de Monachil, occurs near the end of the stage, though it is essentially just the halfway point to the Alto de Sierra Nevada.[1][3] Stage 13 results Rider Team Time 1 David Moncoutie (FRA) Cofidis 5h 09'22" 2 Ezequiel Mosquera (ESP) Xacobeo–Galicia + 52" 3 Alejandro Valverde (ESP) Caisse d'Epargne + 1'16" 4 Robert Gesink (NED) Rabobank + 1'17" 5 Ivan Basso (ITA) Liquigas + 1'17" 6 Samuel Sánchez (ESP) Euskaltel–Euskadi + 1'36" 7 Joaquim Rodríguez (ESP) Caisse d'Epargne + 2'09" 8 Cadel Evans (AUS) Silence–Lotto + 2'34" 9 Paolo Tiralongo (ITA) Lampre–NGC + 2'31" 10 Amaël Moinard (FRA) Cofidis + 3'34" General classification after stage 13 Rider Team Time 1 Alejandro Valverde (ESP) Caisse d'Epargne 56h 23' 08" 2 Robert Gesink (NED) Rabobank + 27" 3 Ivan Basso (ITA) Liquigas + 1' 02" 4 Samuel Sánchez (ESP) Euskaltel–Euskadi + 1' 32" 5 Cadel Evans (AUS) Silence–Lotto + 1' 33" 6 Ezequiel Mosquera (ESP) Xacobeo–Galicia + 2'06" 7 Joaquim Rodríguez (ESP) Caisse d'Epargne + 5' 02" 8 Paolo Tiralongo (ITA) Lampre–NGC + 5' 33" 9 Thomas Danielson (USA) Garmin–Slipstream + 6' 52" 10 Daniel Navarro (ESP) Astana + 8' 21" Stage 14[edit] 13 September 2009 — Granada to La Pandera, 157 km The riders have one more high mountain stage to go through before making it back to flat lands.

It was expected to see a mass sprint finish.[7] Contrary to expectations, Française des Jeux's Anthony Roux was able to hold off the chasing peloton to take the win by just a few meters.

The range forms the western boundary of Panamint Valley, and the northwestern boundary of Searles Valley. The Coso Range is located to the west, and the Panamint Range to the east. Contents 1 Geography 2 Argus Range Wilderness 3 References 4 External links Geography[edit] The Argus Range is one of the westernmost of the Basin and Range Province ranges.[2] The northern end of the range is just south of the Panamint Springs Resort on Highway 190. The range runs south to Argus Peak, just northwest of Searles Lake, near the town of Trona, California. In addition to Argus Peak, the range contains Maturango Peak. The crest of the Argus Range is located within NAWS China Lake and so the peaks of this range are off-limits to the general public. The two peaks that are most alluring to would-be hikers are Argus Peak (6,562 ft or 2,000 m) and Maturango Peak (8,839 ft or 2,694 m) towering to the west of Panamint Valley. Argus Range Wilderness[edit] The Argus Range Wilderness, under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), runs 28 miles (45 km) along the east side of the Argus Range.[3] It extends from the military reservation on the west to the foot of the Argus Range on the east. For most of its length, this wilderness area is no more than two miles (3 km) wide. Several private property holdings are located within this wilderness area including a rather deep cherry-stem at Snow Canyon and a 40-acre (16 ha) parcel known as Onyx Springs between Shepherd and Bendire Canyons. Many land-owners were affected by the creation of the Argus Range Wilderness Area in 1994[citation needed] . References[edit] ^ "Argus Range". Geographic Names Information System.

He was killed attempting to break the land-speed record on March 13, 1929, at Ormond Beach, Florida. Contents 1 Early life 2 Pre-record attempt 3 The record attempt 4 See also 5 References Early life[edit] He was born Conway Lee Bible on a farm near Midway, Tennessee.[1] Pre-record attempt[edit] On March 11, British driver Major Henry O. D. Segrave had set the land-speed record of 231.44 mph (372.47 km/h) in his Golden Arrow, beating the old record held by Ray Keech, who had set the record in the Triplex Special. Jim White, owner of the Special, wanted the title to come back to the United States. Keech was asked to come back and drive the Triplex Special, but he declined, considering the car too dangerous. White then offered the ride to their team mechanic and garage operator, Lee Bible, who saw this as the opportunity of a lifetime. He was declared eligible by officials after a few practice runs, despite his lack of experience. The record attempt[edit] Aftermath of the crash On his first run, Bible was clocked at 186 mph (299 km/h) – well below the record. On his return run he was clocked at 202 mph (325 km/h). However, shortly after the time trap, the car suddenly swerved, presumably[citation needed] because Bible released the accelerator too fast. The Triplex Special crashed into the dunes and rolled, finally coming to a stop 200 feet (61 m) further. During this crash, Bible was thrown from the car, killing him instantly. The Triplex Special rolled into a newsreel cameraman, Charles R. Traub,[2] who was killed instantly.

This is not a soundtrack recording album but the songs used in the films were separately recorded for commercial release. It was issued as a 10” LP with catalog No.DL 5556.[1] The songs from The Country Girl were also issued on an extended play record numbered ED-2156[2] and all of the songs from both films were used in the 15-part Bing’s Hollywood series issued by Decca in 1962. [3] Background[edit] Bing Crosby had moved away from his familiar light comedy musical roles in the 1950s and undertaken two dramatic roles in Little Boy Lost and The Country Girl. Neither of the films was a musical but each had songs which helped to move the action along. The song “Violets and Violins” was not sung by Crosby in the former film but by his wife played by Nicole Maurey.

Contents 1 Biography 2 Works 3 Notes 4 References 5 Further reading 6 External links Biography[edit] Barclay was born in about 1476. His place of birth is matter of dispute, but William Bulleyn, who was a native of Ely, and probably knew him when he was in the monastery there, asserts that he was born "beyonde the cold river of Twede" (River Tweed, i.e. in Scotland). His early life was spent at Croydon, but it is not certain whether he was educated at Oxford or Cambridge. It may be presumed that he took his degree, as he uses the title of "Syr" in his translation of Sallust's Bellum Jugurthinum, and in his will he is called Doctor of Divinity. From the numerous incidental references in his works, and from his knowledge of European literature, it may be inferred that he spent some time abroad. Thomas Cornish, suffragan bishop in the diocese of Bath and Wells, and provost of Oriel College, Oxford, from 1493 to 1507, appointed him chaplain of the college of Ottery St Mary, Devon. Here he wrote his satirical poem, The Ship of Fools, partly a translation from Sebastian Brant. The death of his patron in 1513 apparently put an end to his connection with the west, and he became a monk in the Benedictine monastery of Ely. In this retreat he probably wrote his eclogues, but in 1520 "Maistre Barkleye, the Blacke Monke and Poete" was desired to devise "histoires and convenient raisons to florisshe the buildings and banquet house withal" at the meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.[1] He at length became a Franciscan friar of Canterbury. It is presumed that he conformed with the change of religion, for he retained under Edward VI the livings of Great Baddow, Essex, and of Wokey, Somerset, which he had received in 1546, and was presented in 1552 by the dean and chapter of Canterbury to the rectory of All Hallows, Lombard Street, London. He died shortly after this last preferment at Croydon, Surrey, where he was buried on 10 June 1552. Works[edit] The Ship of Fools was as popular in its English dress as it had been in Germany. It was the starting-point of a new satirical literature. In itself a product of the medieval conception of the fool who figured so largely in the Shrovetide and other pageants, it differs entirely from the general allegorical satires of the preceding centuries. The figures are no longer abstractions; they are concrete examples of the folly of the bibliophile who collects books but learns nothing from them, of the evil judge who takes bribes to favour the guilty, of the old fool whom time merely strengthens in his folly, of those who are eager to follow the fashions, of the priests who spend their time in church telling "gestes" of Robin Hood and so forth. Thus, the work is of interest as throwing light on the manners and customs of the times to which it refers. Barclay also translated the Mirrour of Good Manners, from the Italian of Dominic Mancini, and wrote five Eclogues, printed by Wynkyn de Worde about 1518. His style is stiff and his verse uninspired.

It is one of a number of lighthouses, which have been built on the cays in the coastal waters of Belize. At the southern end of the Turneffe atoll, is a similar but smaller light known as Caye Bokel. The name Mauger comes from the Creole word for meagre, and Bokel is from the Dutch word for elbow.[1][2][3] Contents 1 Description 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Description[edit] The lighthouse consists of a white framework tower which is 19m high; the light is mounted above a watch room and gallery at the top of the tower. A spiral staircase incorporated within the tower allows access to the room and light.[1] The low-lying nature of the island means the light also has a focal height of 19m above sea level, which has a range of 13 nautical miles and consists of a pattern of two flashes of white light every ten seconds.[1][2] The exposed nature of the site means it can be vulnerable to passing hurricanes. During Hurricane Keith the island was badly damaged, with sands being shifted and washed away, exposing the roots of the many palm trees. The duty light keepers, "only survived because they were able to take shelter in a concrete bunker near the lighthouse accommodation, which itself completely disappeared".[4] The lighthouse is operated and maintained by the port authority of Belize. It is registered under the Admiralty number J5940 and has the NGA identifier of 110-16280.[1][2] The surrounding coral reef means the island is a popular dive site, which can be reached by boat from Belize.[1][3] See also[edit] List of lighthouses in Belize References[edit] ^ a b c d e Rowlett, Russ.

It was formed in June 1963 from Benin and Delta provinces of the Western Region, and its capital was Benin City. It was renamed a province in 1966, and in 1967 when the other provinces were split up into several states, it remained territoriality intact, becoming a state. During the Nigerian Civil War, the Biafran forces invaded the new Mid-Western state, en route to Lagos, in an attempt to force a quick end to the war. While under Biafran occupation, the state was declared the "Republic of Benin". As Nigerian forces retook the region, the republic collapsed only a day after the declaration when Nigerian troops captured Benin City. In 1976 the state was renamed Bendel. Bendel State was divided into Delta State and Edo State in 1991.[1] [2] Demographics[edit] The region was composed of the old Benin and Delta Provinces. The Benin provinces had Edo speaking people while the Delta province had Ijaws, Isekiri, Anioma and Urhobo speaking people. [3] Economy[edit] The region had a timber and rubber industry in Sapele which was also supported by a port. In addition, it produced palm related products, maize, beans and other food produce for household consumption. In the Southern Delta province, oil was discovered and was positioned to benefit the region.[4] References[edit] ^ http://logbaby.com/encyclopedia/history-of-delta-state_10219.html#.UqzIAfTuIQo ^ "Mid Western Region, Nigeria (1963-1966)". ^ Mabinuori, Lai (July 13, 1963).

Born to a wealthy merchant family in Vlissingen, in 1654 Adrian and Cornelius led a group of 50 colonists on the opposite side of Tobago of what was then New Courland, and named their settlement New Walcheren. A dispute arose between the Dutch and Couronian colonists, but the Dutch government arbitrated and declared Courland as the legitimate claimant to Tobago. In 1659, however, Courland was seized by Sweden, and the colony was now in the hands of the Dutch. In 1662, the brothers Lampsins collaborated with King Louis XIV of France, and were given the title of the "Barons of Tobago," a title they held until the loss of Tobago to the English in 1666. Approximately 1,500 settlers lived under the rule of the Lampsins brothers. [2] In 1673, Adrian and the late Cornelius' son Jan briefly again retook Tobago, but the island was recaptured by an English force under Sir Tobias Bridge, and Adrian was killed alongside his nephew when the fort was blown up.[3] See also[edit] Cornelius Lampsins Lampsins family References[edit] ^ Charles De Rochefort (1665).

Sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling from the ZLI is crucial in the development of the diencephalon,[1] which develops into the thalamus, the pretectum, and the anterior tegmental structures.[2] The ZLI together with the prethalamus and thalamus make up the mid-diencephalic territory (MDT).[3] Forebrain structures in the fish at 3-4 days (with pretectum from midbrain for better depiction of boundaries), with shh expression in red; rostral extension between the prethalamus and thalamus depicts the ZLI. Contents 1 Discovery 2 Developmental boundaries 3 Formation 3.1 Initial axis patterning 3.2 Emergence of Shh expression 3.3 Positioning 3.4 Differentiation after ZLI degradation 4 Signaling 5 References Discovery[edit] Cell lineage restriction boundaries, across which replicating cells cannot migrate, were first discovered in invertebrates, where the expression of various Hox genes in each compartment confer the differentiation of observable segments in the adult body of Drosophila melanogaster. Analogous structures were discovered in the developing vertebrate brain. Rhombomeres, which extend down the embryo from the hindbrain, contain clear boundaries and each express various Hox genes that are necessary for differentiation of structures within the body. More anterior regions of the brain were examined in search of other cell lineage restriction boundaries, and multiple potential boundaries continue to be studied (see Developmental Boundaries).[4] Layout of Hox genes in the fruitfly leading to differential development of segments The importance of these compartments as local signaling centers, areas which chemically influence surrounding tissue, was elucidated by first observing differential expression of Hox genes in various compartments and second by observing mutant D. melanogaster and corresponding phenotypic (physical) changes.[4] The ZLI was first discovered in the chick using explant and lineage-labeling experiments. In the explant experiments, cells in the region that will become the ZLI, the prethalamus, and the thalamus in the chick were removed and placed into separate cultures; the cells continued to grow and retained their identity (the ZLI began transcribing, whereas the prethalamus and thalamus did not). Necessity of the ZLI and its corresponding ' expression were evidenced by lack of thalamic and prethalamic genetic markers in culture (see Signaling).[5] These experiments confirmed the ZLI as a signaling center. In lineage-labeling experiments, cells were genetically marked, so that each time a labeled cell replicated, its progeny were marked as well. Cells that were marked in the developing ZLI and their progeny remained restricted to the zone. These experiments demonstrated the ZLI as a cell-lineage restriction boundary.[6] Not only a boundary, the ZLI is also a compartment with separate cell lineage restriction boundaries both anterior and posterior of a section of shh expression. The importance of the ZLI was once more confirmed by ectopic expression of shh in other regions of the forebrain, known as the prosencephalon during development (both the telencephalon and diencephalon), inducing a ZLI-like region that induces thalamic fate.[7] Developmental boundaries[edit] During development in both vertebrates and invertebrates, cell lineage restriction boundaries and signaling centers are formed in order to ensure proper differentiation of the body. Chemical signals, like shh from the ZLI, are often released from these boundaries and compartments in a concentration gradient (the chemicals are in much higher concentrations closer to the source) and confer identity to flanking regions. Other genes differentially expressed in these flanking regions aid in ensuring proper differentiation (see Signaling). Main structures of the developing brain: the prosencephalon (forebrain) consists of the telencephalon and diencephalon, the mesencephalon is the midbrain, and the rhombencephalon is the hindbrain. Many developmental boundaries have been studied: within the forebrain alone, the confirmed cell lineage restriction boundaries are the pallial-subpallial boundary (PSB) dividing the dorsal and ventral telencephalon, the diencephalon-midbrain boundary (DMB) posterior to the ZLI, and the ZLI. The ZLI, like each rhombomere, serves as an independent compartment that confers the identity of diencephalon in anterior and posterior regions. Other developmental boundaries serve as cell-lineage restriction boundaries but not signaling centers, while others are signaling centers to and from which cells can migrate. Despite discoveries of cell lineage restriction boundaries and compartments in the brain, many of the regions studied have been disproven as segmental boundaries. These areas have potential as signaling centers, which have influence over the development of neighboring tissues.[4] These boundaries have great influence over other regions of the brain: the placement of the ZLI not only affects the size of adjacent regions but also the size of the telencephalon. A posterior shift in the ZLI allows more cells to be allocated to the telencephalon. The same is true for other developmental boundaries in the brain and throughout the body: shifts in boundaries responsible for allocating a certain amount of tissue to a certain function result in drastic changes in the adult structure. These boundaries are of crucial importance for proper differentiation. Formation[edit] Initial axis patterning[edit] After gastrulation, the embryo is completely undifferentiated and requires many different cues to initiate proper differentiation of the body. The top (roof plate, on the dorsal side of the embryo) and bottom (floor plate, on the ventral side) play a crucial role in these first steps: each acts through global signaling (signaling throughout the entire embryo) for dorsoventral neural patterning. After completion of the development of the dorsoventral axis, more local signaling occurs in the developing brain: developmental boundaries such as the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), rhombomeres, and the ZLI aid in anteroposterior organization.[5] Emergence of Shh expression[edit] Shortly after the beginning of dorsoventral patterning, Shh is expressed along the basal plate (the bottom) of the embryo, which functions in "ventralization of the neural tube, promotion of growth and proliferation, and formation of the hypothalamus".[8] As the embryo continues to develop, Shh expression characteristic of the ZLI extends dorsally to form a wedge that eventually narrows to a strip at approximately 22 somites (the number of developed rhombomeres) or less than one day in zebrafish. Although Shh expression extends dorsally from the basal plate, the ZLI is capable of forming even without the basal plate or mesodermal tissue. Shh cooperates with dlx2 and fezl anteriorly and IRX3 and dbx1a posteriorly (genes expressed vary among different organisms), which are genes that are expressed in the prethalamus and thalamus, respectively.[3] The ZLI is also characterized by a lack of lunatic fringe (lfng), which is observable even before Shh expression is observed in the forming ZLI. This indicates that cells are fated for ZLI formation before induction by Shh (n.b. Shh]' signals from the ZLI and is characteristic of the compartment during and after formation). Lfng is expressed very early (soon after gastrulation) in the region that will become the ZLI, but shortly thereafter expression recedes through migration of lfng-expressing cells to form the lfng-free wedge characteristic of the developing ZLI. Shh expression does not extend dorsally until a few hours later.[5] Positioning[edit] The factors influencing the formation and location of the ZLI are widely studied but still disputed. Differences between different animal models further complicate elucidation of the genetic pathways, specifically between chicks/ mammalian models and zebrafish. Wnt (the family wingless) genes are crucial for the development of the ZLI both directly and indirectly in all animal systems. Along with the role of Wnt genes in patterning the anteroposterior axis through gradient polarization, Wnt8b is expressed within the ZLI itself and may help guide dorsal movement of Shh expression.[9] The Wnt polarization gradient has been linked to induction of ZLI-patterning genes IRX3 and SIX3, which border the ZLI posteriorly and anteriorly, respectively. However, these genes have been shown to be non-essential for ZLI formation in zebrafish and have been reevaluated in other models.[1][3] Specification of the ZLI may also involve the ventral tissues of the embryo: the prechordal and epichordal plates, or neuroepithelial tissue (see figure). Interactions between these tissues may be responsible for the recession of expression of lfng which allows dorsal movement Shh expression.[10] The specific prechrodal and epichordal plates, characterized by expression of SIX3 and IRX3, respectively, may influence positioning of the ZLI more so than the genes themselves.[5] The prechrodal plate ventrally borders the telencephalon, with the epichrodal plate posterior to it. Studies of the formation of the ZLI performed in zebrafish have revealed the significance of OTX2 and IRX1 in ZLI positioning. OTX2 expression characterizes the developing optic tectum, which is responsible for sight processing. Expression extends anteriorly and ends sharply at the ZLI, with high expression along the line where Shh is expressed.[11] Before the ZLI is formed, OTX2] is expressed ubiquitously throughout the forebrain, and begins to recede to the position of the putative ZLI. Experiments where OTX2] expression was repressed showed no dorsal movement of Shh expression and no ZLI formation.[3] Irx1, which is analogous to IRX3 in birds and mammals, is expressed posterior to the ZLI. Studies have suggested that while OTX2 positively restricts the ZLI anteriorly (Shh cannot be expressed where OTX2 is not), 'IRX1 negatively restricts the ZLI posteriorly.[3] Other genes crucial for differentiation in the brain, including Fgf genes responsible for patterning of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), have been implicated in positioning of the ZLI.[9] Studies on the role of Shh signaling in the ZLI were difficult to study for many years, because mutants lacking expression have many developmental deficits including lack of a diencephalon.[12] Explant and lineage-labeling experiments previously described aided in elucidation of the role of Shh and other genes in differentiation of these tissues. More recently, the mouse Shh;Gli3 double mutant was found to have an enlarged diencephalon with a ring of Fgf8 and Wnt in place of the ZLI, indicating a complex interaction between Shh and these genes at the ZLI.[13] This also indicates that other patterning cues are able to establish Fgf8 and Wnt signaling domains at the ZLI in the absence of Shh and Gli3. Differentiation after ZLI degradation[edit] After differentiation of the progenitor cells (at a precise stage yet to be fully determined), the ZLI and its lineage restriction disappears, allowing cells to migrate across the former boundary and the dorsal and ventral thalami to merge into one functional unit, as shown by replication-incompetent retroviral experiments that marked cells and showed their migration throughout the diencephalon.[9] Signaling[edit] After establishment of the ZLI, shh has been shown to induce expression of thalamic and prethalamic markers, gbx2 and dlx2/ nkx2.1, respectively. This differential induction most likely is due to the expression of genes such as IRX3 in the thalamus: ectopic expression experiments showed that if IRX3, which is normally expressed in the developing thalamus, is expressed anterior to the ZLI, then the developing prethalamus will change identity.[10] Note that these genes which help confer shh competence help to pattern the ZLI. Signaling from the ZLI cooperating with thalamic and prethalamic markers ensures the migration of post-mitotic (neural progenitor) cells to the mantle zone where the cells assemble into nuclei characteristic of the thalamus. These nuclei are the mechanism of the relay of information from the thalamus to the cortex. The thalamus itself is highly diverse, with each nucleus having distinct morphologies and physiologies according to the region of the brain to which it is connected. These differences are thought to originate in differential gene expression in the thalamus and prethalamus, which allows for a single structure with multiple different and separate functions once the two have merged and completed growth and differentiation.[9] So a functional interplay between Shh from the ZLI and the bHLH factor Her6 (homolog to HES1) determines the neuronal identity within the thalamus: Her6 positive cells in the prethalamus and rostral thalamus differentiate into GABAergic inhibitory neurons, whereas her negative cells become glutamatergic relay neurons. Both cell types depend on Shh signal as trigger to initiate the developmental programme.[14] References[edit] ^ a b Scholpp S, Lumsden A (Aug 2010).

There were twelve candidates:[3][4] The Union for a Popular Movement chose Pascal Drouhaud, formerly the party's director of international relations.[5] Europe Écologie–The Greens chose Sergio Coronado (born in Chile and raised in Argentina), with Cécile Lavergne as his deputy (suppléante). He was a spokesman for Eva Joly during the 2012 presidential election campaign.[6] Coronado was endorsed by the Socialist Party, which did not presenting a candidate of its own.[7][8] Raquel Garrido, a member of the Left Party, was the chosen candidate for the Left Front, of which she was a co-founder and which also included the French Communist Party. A lawyer, she was described as "Jean-Luc Mélenchon's international spokeswoman". Born in Chile, she moved to France with her parents after the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. In France, she became a leader of the National Union of Students, then vice-president of SOS Racisme. She was also in charge of international relations at the Workers' Force union federation, and represented France at the International Labour Organization. Her deputy (suppléant) was singer-songwriter Nilda Fernández.[9][10][11] The National Front chose Alain-Gérard Georgi-Samaran, a resident of Paraguay who has been "an entrepreneur in South America for more than thirty years". Jean-Marie Matten was his deputy (suppléant).[12] The centre-right Radical Party and the centrist Republican, Ecologist and Social Alliance jointly chose Joel Doglioni, a resident of Bogota, as their candidate. Doglioni was an adviser to France's foreign trade. Jean-Jacques Gaudiot was his deputy (suppléant).[13] The centre-left Radical Party of the Left chose Thérèse Marianne-Pépin. Catherine Prost was her deputy (suppléante).[14] Solidarity and Progress, the French branch of the LaRouche movement, was represented by Cédric Manscour, with Silvia Santorio as his deputy (suppléante).[4] Françoise Lindemann, affiliated to the Union for a Popular Movement, ran as an independent candidate against the party's candidate. A resident of Brazil, she owned and ran a hotel outside Rio de Janeiro. Her deputy (suppléant) was Francis Javelly.[4][15] Charles-Henry Chenut, head of a law firm in Brazil, presented himself as an independent centrist candidate. His deputy was Emmanuel Henriet.[16] Palmira Pozo was an independent candidate. She proposed to allow her constituents to dictate her vote on every bill in Parliament. Francis Le Suave was her deputy.[17] Jean-Marc Millet was an independent candidate, representing his France Expat Collective Vision (Collectif Vision France Expat) movement. Philippe Gillier was his deputy.[4] Alain Terrien was an independent candidate, with Bertrang Lalague as his deputy.[4] Results[edit] Turnout for the first round was low throughout the constituency, with a low point of 7% in Saint Lucia (where 34 of the 488 registered French citizens voted) and a high point of just 39.8% in El Salvador. Turnout was also comparatively high in Cuba (38.1%). Elsewhere, it was below 30%. The smallest turnout in numeric terms was in Suriname, where only 17 citizens voted, out of 148 (11.5%).[18] Sergio Coronado, the candidate of the Greens backed by the Socialist Party, obtained a comfortable lead in the first round. He finished first in almost every country (except the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Panama, Paraguay and Venezuela), and obtained 13 of the 17 votes cast in Suriname (76.47%). The electorate on the mainstream right was split between the UMP-endorsed candidate, Pascal Drouhaud, and dissident candidate Françoise Lindemann, who succeeded in obtaining over 16% of the vote to finish third. Raquel Garrido, the Left Front's international spokeswoman, obtained her party's joint best result abroad (fourth with 8.6%), matched by Juliette Estivil in the fifth constituency.[6][18] Coronado went on to win the second round.[19] Legislative Election 2012: Overseas residents 2 – 2nd round[19] Party Candidate Votes % ±% EELV Sergio Coronado 5,977 53.63 – UMP Pascal Drouhaud 5,168 46.37 – Turnout 11,390 15.55 – EELV win (new seat) Legislative Election 2012: Overseas residents 2 – 1st round[18] Party Candidate Votes % ±% EELV Sergio Coronado 4 128 35.88 – UMP Pascal Drouhaud 2 620 22.77 – DVD Françoise Lindemann 1 851 16.09 – FG Raquel Garrido 990 8.60 – Independent Charles-Henry Chenut 466 4.05 – FN Alain-Gérard Georgi-Samaran 430 3.74 – Radical Joel Doglioni 423 3.68 – Independent Jean-Marc Millet 416 3.62 – PRG Thérèse Marianne-Pépin 119 1.03 – SP Cédric Manscour 41 0.36 – Independent Palmira Pozo 13 0.11 – Independent Alain Terrien 8 0.07 – Turnout 11 680 15.9 – Presidential elections[edit] 2017[edit] e • d Summary of the French presidential election results in the 2nd overseas constituency Candidate Party 1st round 2nd round Votes % Votes % Emmanuel Macron En Marche!

Unlike in humans, melanomas in horses are not thought to be caused by exposure to ultraviolet light.[1] Melanomas are the third most common type of skin cancer in horses, with sarcoids being the first most prevalent and squamous-cell carcinoma being second.[2] Melanomas are typically rounded black nodules that vary in size and are usually be found underneath the dock of the tail, in the anal, perianal and genital regions, on the perineum, lips, eyelids, and sometimes near the throatlatch.[3] These tumors can be either benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous;[4] while the benign tumors typically need little treatment to no treatment, the malignant tumors can cause serious problems and can potentially be life-threatening.[5] Different methods are used to determine if the tumor is malignant and whether it has spread to other organs. Methods used to determine malignancy include fine needle aspirate, biopsy, or complete removal.[4] To determine if the tumor has metastasized, a rectal examination or an ultrasound can be performed; the most frequent location for metastasis include the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, the abdominal wall, the lungs, and blood vessels.[6] If the tumor becomes large enough, it can cause weight loss or colic. It may also affect the horse's ability to turn their head from side to side and eat and drink comfortably if the tumor is on the throat latch area, or cause faecal impaction if tumor is on the anal region.[3] If melanomas become large and ulcerate, they may become infected.[5] Contents 1 Melanoma in gray horses 2 Types of melanoma 2.1 Melanocytic nevus 2.2 Dermal melanoma 2.3 Dermal melanomatosis 2.4 Anaplastic melanoma 3 Treatment 3.1 Surgical removal 3.2 Intralesional cisplatin 3.3 Cimetidine 3.4 Melanoma vaccine 4 References Melanoma in gray horses[edit] Melanomas found on the lip See also: Gray (horse) Gray horses have a higher susceptibility to melanoma than any other coat color, with up to 80% of gray horses developing some kind of melanoma in their lifetime.[4] Some sources state that up to 66% of those melanomas will become malignant.[3] The gray coat color comes from a gene that is responsible for the gradual depigmentation of the horse's coat; horses with this gene are born darker and over time, they lose their coat pigmentation. The gray gene is the strongest coat color modifier, and will act on any base color.[5] The gray coat color is the result of an autosomal dominant trait that is caused by a 4.6-kb duplication in the 6th intron of the gene syntaxin-17 (STX17).[7] The region of this mutation contains four genes: NR4A3 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3), STX17, TXNDC4 (thioredoxin domain–containing-4¢) and INVS (inversin).[7] To determine what makes gray horses more susceptible to melanomas, researchers have used different techniques such as the Northern Blot technique[8] and Real-Time PCR.[9] From these studies, it was concluded that the STX17 gene and the NR4A3 gene are both being over-expressed in gray horses, which is responsible for the increased incidences of melanoma in horses with the gray gene.[7] Types of melanoma[edit] Not all melanoma tumors are the same; there are four different types of melanomas that can be found in horses. Melanocytic nevus[edit] This type of tumor is found in younger horses, around 5 years of age, and are usually benign. They can develop on horses of any color as small single masses, less than 2.5 cm (0.98 in), anywhere on the body.[10] Dermal melanoma[edit] These tumors are usually benign, but can become malignant over time. They vary in size, and can be found as singles or multiples. They are most commonly found in mature grey horses (less than 15 years old), typically under the tail, around the anus, and on the external genitalia.[10] Dermal melanomatosis[edit] These tumors are frequently malignant and have a high tendency to spread to other organs. They are most commonly found in gray horses over the age of 15 as a large coalescing mass under the tail, around the anus, on the external genitalia, or the parotid salivary gland.[10] Anaplastic melanoma[edit] These tumors are malignant and frequently spread to other organs. These are rare tumors, typically found in older (more than 20 years of age) non-gray horses.[10] Treatment[edit] There are several treatment options when a horse is found to have a melanoma tumor. Surgical removal[edit] The surgical removal of a melanoma tumor is performed when the tumors are small; this prevents the tumors from spreading to the surrounding areas.[11] Intralesional cisplatin[edit] Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that is injected into the tumor itself; this drug is commonly used along with surgical removal. That being said, this drug has been shown to resolve tumors with or without surgical removal for at least 2 years.[12] Cimetidine[edit] Cimetidine works by slowing tumor growth; it is a histamine blocker that maintains the body's immune response which aids in the killing of tumor cells. Cimetidine has not been proven to efficiently resolve tumors completely.[13] Melanoma vaccine[edit] A vaccine that is similar to the effective canine melanoma vaccine has been created for equine melanoma, [14] and is being studied at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida [4] References[edit] ^ "NADIS - National Animal Disease Information Service -". www.nadis.org.uk.

It was established in 2007 by Christopher Schwarz and John Hoffman.[1] The company publishes works that help the modern woodworker learn traditional hand-tool skills as they attempt to restore the balance between hand and machine work by unearthing the so-called "lost arts" of hand skills and explaining how they can be integrated with the machinery in the modern shop to help produce furniture that is crisp, well-proportioned, stout and quickly made. "The Anarchist's Tool Chest," written by Christopher Schwarz, paints a world where woodworking tools are at the center of an ethical life filled with creating furniture that will last for generations. It makes the case that you can build almost anything with a kit of fewer than 50 high-quality tools, and it shows you how to select real working tools, regardless of their vintage or brand name and guides you in building a proper chest for your toolkit that follows the ancient rules that have been forgotten or ignored. The "anarchism" mentioned in the title is individualist anarchism, specifically "aesthetic anarchism". References[edit] ^ "About Us & How to Contact Us". lostartpress.com. Retrieved 11 December 2016.

She grew up in Rudme in central Funen. From the age of 4, she became interested in music encouraged by her parents, Knud Stampe Øland and his wife Astrid,[3] who were both school teachers with a special interest in gymnastics. From the age of seven, Øland accompanied her father's gym pupils on the piano. In 1959, when she was 10, she played at a gymnastics presentation in Vejle in the presence of King Frederik IX.[4] After completing her high school education at Nykøbing Mors, Øland attended the Royal Danish Conservatory in Copenhagen where she studied under Herman D. Koppel, graduating in 1977. She continued her studies in Rome with Guido Agosti, Salzburg with Hans Leygraf and Geneva with Nikita Magaloff. She taught at the conservatory from 1980 to 2004 when she moved to the Aarhus Music Academy, receiving the title of professor in 2007.[5] For over 30 years, she was one of Denmark's leading pianists, performing both as a soloist and in chamber orchestras. She was the only Danish pianist to have played not only all of Carl Nielsen's works for piano but all 32 Beethoven sonatas. The latter she played in the Tivoli Concert Hall in 2002, devoting seven evening performances to the works.[5] There are recordings of her complete Carl Nielsen Works for Solo Piano (1988) and of her Complete Piano Sonatas of Beethoven (2009).[6] Øland was also a leading light as an educator, instructing celebrities such as Katrine Gislinge, Christina Bjørkøe, Nikolaj Koppel and Tanja Zapolski.[2] References[edit] ^ "Anne Øland" (in Danish).

He eventually moved to Ukraine, while his parents remained residents of Kursk.[5] In 2000, he graduated from Kiev University. From 1986–1990 Babaiev served in the Soviet Army. He was stationed in the Soviet Union's far east and later in Czechoslovakia. After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, Babaiev's unit withdrew from Czechoslovakia and he was stationed in Kiev. In 1990, he obtained Ukrainian citizenship. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Babaiev served as a reserve officer in the Ukrainian army until 1996, eventually reaching the rank of colonel.[6] He became Chairman of JSC Kremenchukm'yaso in 1998 and President of a football club, FC Vorskla Poltava, in 2005. He was also honorary president of FC Kremin Kremenchuk (lower leagues). Memorial to Oleh Babaiev located in Kremenchuk Babaiev was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) in the 2007 parliamentary election. He was a member of the All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland", but left the party in late 2010 after he was elected Mayor of Kremenchuk (with 42.34% of the votes), stating that "The mayor should be apolitical".[7] As mayor, Oleh Babaiev was perhaps best known for the recreational projects he promoted within the city. Being an avid sportsman, Babaiev invested heavily to rebuild the aging Soviet-era parks and sports stadiums within the city. Some of the most notable parks to be restored under Babaiev's tenure as mayor of Kremenchuk were the October Square, later renamed Babaiev Square after his honor, and the 18-hectare (44-acre) Pridneprovsky Park in the city's center.[8][9][10] Babaiev was shot dead on July 26, 2014.[11] According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, he was killed in his car in front of his house when an unidentified person fired three shots from a gun with a silencer from another car.[11] 50,000 people attended his funeral, including Kiev mayor Vitaly Klitchko.[12] On January 19, 2015, a memorial to Oleh Babaiev was unveiled in Kremenchuk. The building of the memorial was financed by the slain mayor's friends. Babaiev's parents opened the memorial. The memorial is located in one of the city parks that the mayor was instrumental in restoring.[13] References[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Oleh Babaiev. ^ (in Ukrainian) Biography, D A T A ^ a b c Oleg Babaev (in Ukrainian) ^ "More Azerbaijanis made it to Ukraine parliament".

Lyon (September 13, 1887 – July 20, 1960) was an American attorney from California who served as a Republican in the California State Assembly and the California State Senate. Lyon was Assembly Speaker from 1943 to 1946. Lyon was admitted to the bar in 1910 and was first elected to the Assembly in 1914.[1] Lyon served numerous terms in the Senate and Assembly and authored the legislation creating the UCLA campus.[2] Contents 1 Early life and career; fraternal activities 2 Political career 3 Scandal and later life 4 References Early life and career; fraternal activities[edit] Lyon was born in Los Angeles on September 13, 1887. He was the eighth of nine children of James H. and Laura Emma (Simpson) Lyon, who had moved to California from Maine. The family was distantly related to John Alden and to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. James Lyon was a carpenter foreman and architect.[3] Charles attended the public schools in Los Angeles and San Francisco,[4] then studied law at night while working for the Title Insurance and Trust Company in Los Angeles; he had begun working for the company at the age of fifteen. He was admitted to the California Bar at the age of 23 in 1910. He then went into private practice as a member of the firm of Fredericks & Hanna.[3] He married Nancy Janney, daughter of a well known Utah mining engineer on September 21, 1912,[3] and the couple would have three children.[4] At age 21, Lyon was elected president of Los Angeles Parlor No. 45 of the Native Sons of the Golden West. Lyon became state president of the California State Aerie of Eagles, which then had over thirty thousand members in California. In 1919, he was elected exalted ruler for 1919–20 of Santa Monica Elks Lodge.[3] Political career[edit] In 1914, Lyon became City Attorney of Venice, California, where he and his family were living as of 1921. Later that year, Lyon was elected to the California State Assembly as a Republican, and was reelected in 1916. While in the Assembly, he opposed the Populist reforms being enacted at that time. In 1918, he ran for the State Senate, and was elected. He remained in the Senate until defeated for re-election in 1930.[4] After two years out of office, Lyon ran for and was elected to the Assembly again, and would serve there until 1946. In the Assembly, he feared that Governor Frank Merriam would move to the left in response to the Depression, and actively opposed Merriam's Democratic successor, Culbert Olson.[4] While Lyon's 1938 re-election did not get any especial note at the time, it is remembered today because of the later careers of the opponents whom he defeated. Lyon cross-filed, running in both the Republican and Democratic primaries, and secured his re-election by defeating future Richard Nixon campaign manager Murray Chotiner in the Republican poll, and narrowly beating Robert A. Heinlein (who subsequently turned to writing science fiction) in the Democratic contest.[5] Heinlein's political short story, "A Bathroom of Her Own" is based on Heinlein's own political experiences in the race against Lyon. In 1939, Lyon became Assembly minority leader. The following year, during the special session, Republicans and conservative Democrats formed a ruling coalition, and Lyon became Chairman of the Rules Committee. The Republicans won a majority in the Assembly in 1942, and Lyon was elected Speaker the following year, a post he held for two terms.[4] By this time, Republican Earl Warren had defeated Olson for reelection, and Lyon cooperated with Warren on such issues as postwar planning.[6] In 1946, Lyon ran unsuccessfully for the position of Lieutenant Governor of California. In 1950, he recaptured a seat in the Assembly, and was reelected in 1952. Scandal and later life[edit] Lyon's political career ended in scandal when, in 1954, he was convicted in connection with a liquor license bribery scheme in Southern California. Lyon was convicted of grand theft and conspiracy to commit grand theft.[4] Lyon was paroled on November 5, 1956, after serving 18 months of a 5-year sentence at San Luis Obispo's Men's Colony.[7] In 1958, he was pardoned by Governor Goodwin Knight. He spent his final years as a lobbyist for the Southern California Merchants Association.[4] Lyon died of cancer in July 1960, in Beverly Hills, California. In December 1961, Governor Edmund G. "Pat" Brown pardoned Lyon's fellow conspirator, former Assembly Member Delbert Morris.[8] Charles W. Lyon is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery. References[edit] ^ LA Times, C.W.

(December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Digital sheet music used by Jordan Rudess (FreeHand MusicPad Pro) Digital sheet music is technology for representing and displaying sheet music in a computer-readable format. With the emergence of several technological innovations, sheet music evolved in several stages into what was to be termed digital sheet music. Contents 1 Music Notation Software 2 OMR 3 New commercial possibilities 4 Apps 5 Cloud-based apps 6 Reading digital sheet music 7 See also 8 References Music Notation Software[edit] With the increased use of professional and personal computers during the 1980s, different programmers[who?] started working on desktop publishing music notation software. Various boxed music notation software applications appeared on the market, allowing users to input and edit sheet music digitally. In the beginning, the software only permitted printing on paper. It took some time before other virtual formats became possible (e.g. standard MIDI file, audio (wav, mp3) and MusicXML export). These files allowed manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and even MIDI playback. In particular, software projects Finale and Sibelius grew to become successful commercial products and to define certain standards in digital music notation. Many free software projects also appeared (see list of scorewriters). Consequently, computer keyboard entry in combination with synthesizer keyboard entry became the most common method for music data entry in current digital use (Bainbridge & Bell 2001,[page needed]). OMR[edit] Optical music recognition (OMR) is software to “read” scanned sheet music. Although OMR contributed to the evolution of digital sheet music, it is currently still a complex problem (Johansen 2009). While the earliest attempts of OMR were made in the early 1970s, the first commercial products appeared in the early 90s. Currently, many commercial OMR tools are available: SharpEye2, SmartScore, Photoscore, CapellaScan (Bellini, Bruno, & Nesi 2007). OMR can be simplified into four smaller tasks: staff line identification, musical object location, musical feature classification and musical semantics (Bainbridge & Bell 2001). However, in most cases, these systems operate only properly with well-scanned documents of high quality. When it comes to precision and reliability, none of the commercial OMR systems solve the problem in a satisfactory way (Johansen 2009). Especially since the tradition of notating music is quite diffuse and varied, it remains difficult to reduce its aesthetics to a few principles for a machine to follow (Brandorff, Lindholm, & Christensen 2005,[page needed]). New commercial possibilities[edit] With the emergence of electronic commerce in the 2000s, some traditional sheet publishers, as well as new entrants, developed online retailer websites to offer sheet music in an electronic manner. The first to offer the service online was Sheet Music Direct (1997) but quickly followed by MusicNotes and Sheet Music Score who were able to offer interactive features like transposition and change of instrument using scorch (Avid) technology. Newcomer Sheet Music Plus only recently (2011) entered the market, offering PDF files only. Those commercial services started as worldwide retailers with a large base of licensed sheet music and fast delivery, but progressively offered digital print, ranging from PDF-files to more dynamic offerings such as Scorch technology (Avid) which allowed for midi accompaniment, and on-the-fly change of keys and instruments. In addition, the popular use of digital sheet music required interchangeable digital formats. As such, MusicXML became a common format to share sheet music files between applications and to archive sheet music files for future use. Apps[edit] The digital revolution of the 2010s introduced widespread use of mobile networked devices, mobile telephony and tablet computers. Tablet computers, in particular, introduced new opportunities for digital sheet music through their usable digital display (IBISWorld 2011; IBISWorld 2013). Consequently, many iOS and Android apps were introduced in the sheet music market, offering digital sheet music on various mobile platforms. The first generation viewers displayed PDF-files with features such as basic annotations, exportation of those annotations to other PDF readers and printing scores. PDFs are “static” files: you can read the music as it appears on the page, and you can only modify the notes by drawing digital ink markings or by typing text on the page (Hugh 2012). Cloud-based apps[edit] Most recently, the rise of cloud computing is further pushing the development of digital sheet music and enables creating and sharing written music online. A cloud-based application is immediately available on the web on any type of computer and does not need to be installed. HTML5 in particular spurs cloud computing, allowing development of device independent web applications and making digital sheet music responsive and appropriate on large as well as on small screens. Cloud-based music notation applications facilitate the creation and sharing of written music. Additionally, other cloud-based applications focus more on the practice and consumption side of music learning. These latter cloud-based applications integrate audio-output such as playback with a variety of tempi (speeds) and with different instrumentation for multi-part scores and make the viewing and playing more interactive by adding personal annotations, automatic page turning, or set lists. Reading digital sheet music[edit] Overall, four factors appear to facilitate digital sheet reading: computer, content, containers and controllers (Hugh 2012): Computer: depending on the musical work or performance, different form factors might facilitate the digital sheet music consumption Content: a choice of static content versus dynamic content, and a choice of open content versus proprietary content. Containers: hardware accessories used to hold or mount your computer Controllers: hardware accessories that enable you to work with your digital sheet music in a variety of ways, ranging from digital pens to draw annotations, to pedals and other switches that allow you to turn the pages without using your hands.

Biography[edit] Saint Rumon was likely a missionary originally from Ireland. Little else is known about him because, according to Father Alban Butler who cites William of Malmesbury, the history of his life was destroyed during war,[1][which?] but he was probably a brother of St Tudwal of Tréguier. Sometime before 960, Ordulf, Earl of Devon, built a church under his invocation.[1] Several other churches in Devon and Cornwall were also named after him[2] as well as the village of Romansleigh.[3] Some authorities believe him to be the same historical figure as St Ronan who is venerated in Brittany on 1 June.[4] Others[who?] think that he and St Kea were British monks who founded a monastery at Street, Somerset.[citation needed] Veneration[edit] In the Catholic Church, the feast of St Rumon is observed on various dates in different British locations. The translation of St Rumon is celebrated on 5 January.[5] The Holy Hierarch Rumon is venerated on 30 August according to the Julian Calendar in Western Orthodoxy.[3] References[edit] ^ a b "CatholicSaints.Info » Blog Archive » Butler’s Lives of the Saints – Saint Rumon, Bishop in England". catholicsaints.info.

The Milkmen had an even 4-4 won-loss card when they lost their last two games to Sta.Lucia, 101-116 on April 2, and were ousted by Swift in the All-Filipino Cup, 103-115 on April 11. [1] Before the start of the Commissioner's Cup, the Milkmen acquired Rene Hawkins from Sta.Lucia when they finally gave up on Paul Alvarez, who hasn't signed a contract nor joined the Milkmen's practice sessions by trading him to the Realtors. Alaska acquired another new player in Dondon Ampalayo of Ginebra just before the end of the eliminations as they traded Bobby Jose in return. Going into the last day of the semifinal round on August 22, the Milkmen were locked in a four-way race in a playoff for the second finals berth along with Shell, San Miguel and Purefoods. All four teams carry a 10-8 won-loss card. Alaska lost to Purefoods Oodles, 80-105, in their do-or-die game. Resident import Sean Chambers played three games for Alaska in the Governor's Cup, leading the Milkmen to an opening day 102-98 win against Ginebra on September 26. [2] The Milkmen lost their next two games and Chambers, hurting on his foot, temporarily given his spot to his recommended Rodney Fuller, who was below six feet and was replaced by Rodney Monroe after four games. Monroe played one game in Alaska's 87-91 loss to Purefoods in Iloilo City on October 23 and a contract dispute led to Monroe leaving. Sean Chambers was back from the injured list and scored a career-high 63 points upon his return as Alaska defeated Ginebra, 130-117 on October 26. The Milkmen failed to advance in the semifinal round as they lost to Swift, 97-100 in their last game in the eliminations on November 2.

It has been used as common land since the medieval period and is best known for the discovery of the preserved bog body of Lindow Man in 1984. The peat bog was formed in a collection of hollows left by melting ice at the end of the last ice age. It is believed to have been a site of religious significance to the ancient Celts.[1] The first written record of Lindow Moss was in 1421 when the lord of Mobberley and Wilmslow allowed people to dig peat from the mossland for use as fuel.[2] It originally covered over 600 hectares (1,500 acres), but has since shrunk to a tenth of its original size. The bog can be a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there.[3] For centuries, peat from the bog was used as fuel. It continues to be extracted but now for mixing within compost products. The process is now mechanised with a mechanical digger. The site is known for its flora and fauna such as hare's-tail cottongrass, common cottongrass[4] and green hairstreak butterfly. It also has been a habitat for water voles although their continued existence is threatened by sinking water levels. The Saltersley Common Preservation Society promotes the preservation of the moss.[5] In November 2011, they teamed up with a local amateur filmmaker to produce a short video detailing the history of the bog and some of the threats it faces.[6] See also[edit] Cheshire portal Lindow Common—adjacent SSSI Notes[edit] ^ "Lindow Man: Gruesome discovery who became 'international celebrity'".

The first woman to participate in documentary filmmaking, she is remembered for her ethnographic short films which explored the diversity of Colombian culture. Winning numerous awards, her work is part of the collection of the Latin American Film Archive at the MOMA in Manhattan. Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 3 Death and legacy 4 References 4.1 Citations 4.2 Bibliography Early life[edit] Gabriela Samper García was born on 31 March 1918 in Bogotá, Colombia to Saturia García Alvarez and Pedro Miguel Samper. Her father was an attorney, originally from Madrid.[1] From a well-to-do family,[2] she was educated at home by her mother and maternal grandmother, Saturia Alvarez de García, who had trained in pedagogy. She also had lessons from Elizabeth Birmingham, her Irish governess. In 1928, she enrolled at the Gimnasio Femenino (Women's Gymnasium) in Bogotá, graduating in 1936.[1][3] She traveled throughout Europe before enrolling in Columbia University in New York City[2] to study English literature[1] and take dance courses with Martha Graham.[4] Later she enrolled in dance classes at the Bodenwiser Academy and lived in Trinidad, before returning to Colombia and enrolling in the National University of Colombia, studying philosophy and letters.[1][4] Career[edit] In 1941, Samper received her professorship and married Ulric de Verteuil.[3] She began her career as a teacher of dance, English, and history at the Universidad de los Andes and the Free University of Colombia.[1] During La Violencia, the period between 1948 and 1958 marked by dictatorship and violence in Colombia, Samper was actively involved in the political movements opposed to the conflict and civil unrest.[3] In 1958, she joined the Grupo del Búho, a theater group, and was involved in producing works at the Open Air Theater "La Media Torta", the Teatro Colón and the Teatro Cultural. She directed performances at the Teatro El Burrito in 1960 and three years later was appointed director of the Cultural Theater of the National Park.[1] In the early years of her career, Samper was involved in children's theater and puppetry, which is what she is most remembered for in her home country. She produce television shows and participated in dance and literary works before turning to film making in 1963.[2] With her third husband, Ray Witlin, Samper founded Cinta Limited, a film production company and the couple made documentary and publicity films in Colombia and the United States.[2] Initially the two produced commercials, but in 1965, Samper wrote and directed El páramo de Cumanday (The Heights of Cumanday), a 22-minute film retelling a Colombian legend shot in the high Andes, as her first artistic film.[4] It explored the fears and struggles of muleteers, fight against the elements and environment.[5] El páramo de Cumanday won the third prize for short films in the 1965 Festival of Puerto Rico.[1][5] Her ethnographic shorts, focus on the cultural diversity of Colombia.[2] Her Historia de muchos años (History of Many Years, 1965) and Qué es Intercol (What is Intercol, 1965), respectively won the Catalina de Oro and a Gold Mention at the VII Festival of Cartagena.[1][5] She made two films in the United States in 1967,[4] Una máscara para ti, una máscara para mí (A Mask for You, a Mask for Me) and Ciudades en crisis ¿qué pasa? (Cities in Crisis, What’s Happening?).[5] Returning to Colombia, in 1969, Samper produced three films: Festival folclórico de Fomenque (Fomenque Folk Festival), Los santísimos hermanos (The Brotherhood of the Most Hoy), and El hombre de la sal (The Salt Maker).[1][5] Los santísimos hermanos explores a religious sect which arose in the 1960s in the mountains of the Tolima Department, who reacted to the era's violence by withdrawing and seeking peace through penance. The documentary is preserved in the Museum of Modern Art's Latin American Film Archive in Manhattan.[5] El hombre de la sal was an exploration by Samper of the conflict between traditional artistry and technology.[5] The film won recognition at the Festival de Valencia in Valencia, Venezuela and took the Cruz de Málta at the First Latin American Film Festival in Córdoba, Argentina.[1][5] In 1972, while working as the director of cultural distribution at the Agustín Codazzi Institute, Samper was arrested and charged as a member of the National Liberation Army. Undergoing both physical and psychological torture,[3][2] she was released after five months in prison, because of a lack of evidence. Leaving the country, she spent the next year and a half studying at Cornell University.[2] Death and legacy[edit] Diagnosed with cancer Samper died on 16 May 1974 in Bogotá.[2][1] She is seen as one of the pioneering women in Colombian film production, as her ethnographic works inspired Marta Rodríguez, Jorge Silva and Gloria Triana to make films on marginalized populations in Colombia and document cultural traditions.[4] Posthumously, a collection of her short stories, La Guandoca, which relates her experiences as a political prisoner was published.[1][3] In 2009, the Aurelio Arturo Auditorium of the National Library hosted a cinematographic exhibition of the works of Gabriela and her daughter Mady, also a filmmaker.[3] In 2014, Albeiro Pérez directed a performance at the Pequeño Teatro of Gilberto Martínez's adaptation of La Guandoca for the stage.[6] References[edit] Citations[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l Samper 2011. ^ a b c d e f g h Kuhn & Radstone 1990, p. 350. ^ a b c d e f Santos Molano 2009. ^ a b c d e Rist 2014, p. 507. ^ a b c d e f g h Calle Guerrero 2015. ^ Tejada 2014.
