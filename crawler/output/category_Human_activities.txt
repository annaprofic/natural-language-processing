Contents 1 Bounty mutiny 2 Personal life 3 Death 4 Further reading 5 References 6 External links Bounty mutiny[edit] Following the mutiny led by Fletcher Christian, the Bounty was taken to Tahiti for a few days before being compelled to set sail. McCoy joined Christian and seven other mutineers. They took eleven Tahitian women and six men with them. After months at sea, the mutineers discovered the uninhabited Pitcairn Island and settled there in January 1790. Personal life[edit] McCoy had one consort, Teio, and fathered two children, Daniel and Catherine. After three years, a conflict broke out between the Tahitian men and the mutineers, resulting in the deaths of all the Tahitian men and five of the Englishmen (including Fletcher Christian). McCoy (Scottish) was one of the survivors. Death[edit] McCoy discovered how to distill alcohol from the sweet syrup of the ti tree root.[1][2] He, Matthew Quintal, and some of the women would lie around all day in a drunken stupor. On 20 April 1798, while drunk, he killed himself by tying a stone to his neck and leaping off a cliff.[3][4] Further reading[edit] Christiane Conway (2005) Letters from the Isle of Man - The Bounty-Correspondence of Nessy and Peter Heywood, The Manx Experience, ISBN 1-873120-77-X References[edit] ^ "William McCoy".

Little is known of his life; his family is believed to have been from Nice originally, and his correspondence is mostly written in French. In 1850, when Piedmont decided to adopt the use of stamps to prepay for postal service, their first thought was to inquire in Paris about how stamps were designed and manufactured. But the report included a mention of an ongoing dispute over appropriate fees for engravers, so with only a couple months left before the stamps were to go on sale, the authorities turned to a local resource in the form of Matraire, whose prior experience was in labels for patent medicines and the general printing needs of Turin. Matraire did not have facilities for recess printing, so his first stamps were produced by lithography, later (1855) switching to letterpress. The authorities being concerned about forgery, he proposed the embossing that was used in the stamps of 1853 and thereafter. The last stamp produced by Matraire was the 15c blue issued in February 1863. Thereafter he mostly disappears from history, although he was known to be alive in 1884. References[edit] Roy A.

The district contains all of Blair County, Huntingdon County, Bedford County, Fulton County, Franklin County, and Adams County. It also includes most of Somerset County, and parts of Westmoreland County, Cambria County, and Cumberland County. Republican John Joyce has represented the district since 2019. Prior to February 2018, the district was located in southeastern Pennsylvania, covering eastern Montgomery County and Northeast Philadelphia. The district traditionally included most of Montgomery County, but was redrawn in 2002 to include part of Philadelphia, and altered again in 2012. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the district in February 2018 after ruling the previous map unconstitutional. The old 13th district became the 4th district, and what was the ninth district in the southwest part of the state was modified and redesignated the 13th district, for the 2018 elections and representation thereafter.[2] The previously drawn district had long been a Republican stronghold, like many suburban districts in the Northeast. However, the brand of Republicanism in southeastern Pennsylvania was a moderate one, and the district, like the Philadelphia suburbs as a whole, became friendlier to Democrats during the 1990s as the national party veered to the right. The district had not voted Republican for President since 1988. In 1992, the district elected its first Democratic representative in 86 years, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky. She was swept out in 1994 by Republican Jon D. Fox, but Joe Hoeffel regained the seat for the Democrats in 1998. It was in Democratic hands from then until the 2018 redistricting, and became even more Democratic since being pushed into Philadelphia after the 2000 census. The district is currently located in an area of the state that is, and has been, solidly Republican.

The film stars Rain, Shin Se-kyung and Yoo Jun-sang in lead roles. It was directed by Kim Dong-won and is a remake of Shin Sang-ok's 1964 film Red Scarf.[1][2] It is about a talented, yet troublemaking, elite air force pilot who is demoted to a combat flying unit.[3][4][5] It was released on 15 August 2012. Republic of Korea Air Force was heavily involved to support filming.[citation needed] The film was the final acting project for Rain, before he enlisted to serve his mandatory military service in October after filming wrapped in September 2011.[6] The film is also known under the alternate titles Black Eagle and Soar Into the Sun. Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 International release 4 References 5 External links Plot[edit] Captain Jung Tae-yoon (Rain), a South Korean Air Force pilot in the Black Eagles aerobatic team, performs a cocky and dangerous maneuver during an air show and is transferred to the 21st Fighter Wing, a combat unit flying the F-15K strike fighter. There he meets Cheol-hee (Yoo Jun-sang), the unit's own top gun. The two come into conflict immediately, since Tae-hun is free-spirited, whereas Cheol-hee plays by the rules. However, when a reconnaissance mission unexpectedly becomes an incident, the two team up to rescue their missing comrades and avert a nuclear exchange between North and South Korea. As a consequence of the mission, an F-15 has been shot down on the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone and a Korean People's Air Force MiG-29 entered South Korean airspace and bombed Seoul. A rescue mission is sent, with South Korean air force pararescue in heavily armed Blackhawk helicopters supported by a strike package involving a KAI T-50 and F-15s armed with Mavericks, JDAMS and Sidewinders. The F-15 pilots manage to down the rogue MiG-29 which earlier attacked Seoul and restore the honour of their country and their squadron by shooting it down using an AIM-9 sidewinder air-to-air missile. During the dogfight, the MiG stalls, giving the pilot of the F-15K an opportunity to shoot it down. The rescue mission and a strike against a nuclear silo are a success, however, the T-50 is lost while trying to evade a SAM. Despite the odds, the pilot survives; the end shows Jung giving his final respects to his fallen comrade.[7] Cast[edit] Rain - Captain Jung Tae-yoon, a former Black Eagles pilot who is reassigned to the 21st Fighter Wing as an F-15K pilot (he is the Korean counterpart of Maverick) Shin Se-kyung - Technical Sergeant Yoo Se-young, a 21st Fighter Wing mechanic & Tae-Yoon's love interest.

It endemic to Cuba and known from scattered localities in the western part of the island as well as from Isla de la Juventud (its type locality, formerly Isla de Pinos).[1][3] Common name Pinos robber frog has been coined for it.[3] Description[edit] Eleutherodactylus pinarensis is a relatively large species. The tympanum is relatively large, nearly as large as the eye. Fingers III and IV have developed disks. Toes are without webbing. Skin is uniformly shagreened above whereas the belly is feebly rugose. Coloration is marbled dark and light with indications of crossbars or dorso-lateral light lines.[2] Specimens described by Dunn as "cross-barred juveniles" were later described as a separate species, Eleutherodactylus klinikowskii.[4] Habitat and conservation[edit] Eleutherodactylus pinarensis occurs in rocky areas, coastal cliffs, and caves in mesic forests. It does not occur outside forest habitat. It is an uncommon species. It is threatened by habitat disturbance caused by tourist activities, including infrastructure development for tourism. It occurs in the Guanahacabibes National Park and in several other protected areas.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c Hedges, B.; Díaz, L. (2004). "Eleutherodactylus pinarensis".

He had been in prison from 1681 to 1719 and initiated a war to seize the throne in 1719. He was son of rebel Muhammad Akbar, son of Aurangzeb and was brought up in a harem in Agra. In 1695 he was 16 was appointed subehdar of Assam until 1701. In 1702 The Prince appointed Subehdar of Sindh by Aurangzeb he served until 1707. The local Minister Birbal (not the Birbal of Akbar's fame) used him as puppet and proclaimed him emperor, but since the prince had spent his life inside harem and talked like a catamite, he was laughingly ignored and again put in jail by the Syed Brothers.[1] He died in 1723 at age of 43.[2] Contents 1 War of Succession and fate 2 Ancestry 3 References 4 External links War of Succession and fate[edit] On 18 May 1719, the local governor of Agra; Birbal, brought out Prince Nekusiyar from his harem prison and, in order to enhance his own powers, proclaimed him Emperor of India at Agra Fort. However, an ambition so grand could not be accomplished, and the Syed Brothers defeated both Nekuseyar and Birbal by June and deposed both of them from their former posts. Nekusiyar was arrested on 13 August 1719, and again placed in his old harem prison at Agra. However, soon after, he was moved to Salimgarh in Delhi where he died on 12 April 1723 at the age of 43.

HartmannStarringJean HersholtNarrated byJean HersholtCinematographyMilton KrasnerDistributed byWar Activities Committee of the Motion Pictures IndustryRelease date16 April 1944Running time21 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglish To the People of the United States is a short propaganda film produced by the US Public Health Service in 1943 to warn the American GIs against syphilis. It was directed by Arthur Lubin and produced by Walter Wanger.[1][2] The film was subject to protests from the Catholic Legion of Decency.[3] Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Production 4 Reception 5 Protests 6 Awards 7 References 8 External links Plot[edit] The film opens with the ground crew of a flying fortress talking to their colleagues about being grounded. It seems the other planes in their unit are off to fight the enemy, but they and their plane lie idle because their pilot is "sick". The pilot, whose face is never shown, talks with a doctor, feeling very embarrassed and guilty about what has happened. The doctor assures him that he will fly again when he gets better. When the pilot interjects that he has heard he wouldn't, the doctor asks "Heard from who? The kid next door or the drug patent salesman? Surely not anyone who knew what he was talking about." The doctor then informs him that if the disease is caught early, and he keeps up a strict treatment he will be able to go about his business normally again. Once the pilot leaves the doctor addresses the audience "Do you want the facts? Well the first question is the extent of syphilis in America." A visit to the local draft board later reveals that nearly 47 of every thousand men called up have to be dismissed because they have syphilis. He then visits an Army hospital and is informed by the doctor that syphilis is like a "forest fire", no organization or saboteur could do half the damage that venereal disease does to the army. The doctor then goes into the social stigma associated with syphilis, and the fact that so many people will not get a blood test to check for syphilis. He notes that, in his native Scandinavia, people were much more open about it, and it was a normal sight for people to get a blood test for syphilis. He shows a diagram of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, which he says has a population comparable to the State of New York, and how fewer Scandinavians have VD than New Yorkers. The film ends with a plea for everyone to get a blood test. Cast[edit] Jean Hersholt as Colonel Jensen - Medical Corps. Norman T.

Hinds as Harrison - Member of Local Draft Board Arthur Loft as Griffith - Member of the Local Draft Board Robert Mitchum as Bomber Ground Crew Production[edit] The film was made at the request of the Public Health Service and the California State Department of Public Health, using public funds.[4] The director and all the actors volunteered their time for the film and it was shot in November 1943. The intent was for the film to be distributed free by the Public Health Service to the armed services, schools, civic organisations and industrial groups.[1] The film was made with the co operation of the office of the Surgeon General and the script was approved by the army and the Office of War Information.[5] Reception[edit] Diabolique magazine says the film "is the sort of doco that is easy to laugh at (“syphilis – say it!”) but actually has a fine message: don't be ashamed if you're infected, look to science rather than urban legend, get tested and treated, follow the example of Denmark when it comes to sex education. This is all sensible stuff, and accordingly offended the Catholic Legion of Decency."[6] Protests[edit] The Catholic Legion of Decency protested the finished film, saying it failed "to stress that promiscuity is the principal cause of venereal disease." The Legion said the film would "pave the way for a flood of pictures by producers who do not hesitate to avail themselves of every opportunity for lurid and pornographic material for financial gain."[7] Producer Wanger argued that the film did not violate the Production Code section on sex and hygenie as the Code did not apply to government films. He said the Code did apply to commercial pictures and would ensure any commercial film did not promote promiscuity. However the protests worked and on March 30, 1944 the Public Health Service withdrew its sponsorship of the film.[7] On April 16, the California Department of Health made the film available for public showing.[4] Catholics continued to protest the movie.[8] Awards[edit] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.[9][10] References[edit] ^ a b "Wagner, Lubin Make Social Disease Shortie".

The 2010 season started two weeks earlier than in previous years to accommodate the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, in which netball is a core sport. 69 matches were played over 17 weeks, including an initial 14-week round-robin stage, followed by a three-week finals stage. Several rule changes were also implemented in the 2010 season. After 14 weeks of round-robin competition, the Swifts emerged undefeated as minor premiers, progressing to the finals stage with the Thunderbirds, Magic and Steel. But the Thunderbirds progressed to the grand final, inflicting the first loss of the season for the Swifts, who lost the preliminary final to the Magic one week later. The grand final was contested on 11 July in Adelaide between the Thunderbirds and Magic. In front of a capacity crowd, the Thunderbirds defeated the Magic by 52–42 to emerge as champions for the 2010 season. Transfer season[edit] The 2010 ANZ Championship season, the third year of the competition was expected to be the best yet. Teams organised their franchises, and then went on the hunt to poach opposition players. There was excitement on both sides of the Tasman. New Zealand The Northern Mystics made the most changes to their squad from by keeping four of their twelve members from last year's squad. They were Samoan international shooter Catherine Latu (ineligible player), Silver Fern midfielder and Mystics captain Temepara George, Grace Rasmussen, and Finau Pulu. The Mystics signed Maria Tutaia and Joline Henry from Waikato/BOP Magic as well as Larrissa Willcox from the Canterbury Tactix. The Mystics also signed an import player, Althea Byfield, Jamaican international player who played for Central Pulse in 2009. In addition, the Mystics managed to sign former Silver Ferns player Jenny-May Coffin out of retirement and a couple of young players to their side. With these changes to their side, it also meant that eight members were not in the team including England shooter Pamela Cookey opted not to play as she decided to play in the English Netball Superleague and former Silver Fern and Fiji international Villi Davu. The Waikato/BOP Magic made some changes to their side by picking up Jodi Brown from the Tactix and Australian international and World 7 player Peta Scholz out of retirement to replace Maria Tutaia and Joline Henry who opted to play for the Mystics. The Magic also lost Leana de Bruin to the Steel and two other players Halana Leith and Nicola Pettit, both played in both 2008 and 2009 seasons. During the season, the Magic lost Peta Scholz due to knee injury and ruled her out for the remainder of the season. As a result, the team managed to replace her with England international Jade Clarke. The team kept their Silver Ferns players Irene van Dyk, Laura Langman (captain). Casey Williams and Samoan international Frances Solia (ineligible player). The Central Pulse lost Althea Byfield to the Mystics and replaced her with English import Ama Agbeze (import player) from Melbourne Vixens and Adelaide Thunderbirds bench player and former Australian international Jane Altschwager (captain and import player). They also gained Silver Fern defender Katrina Grant from the Southern Steel, to form a nice looking team. The team also features Silver Fern shooter Paula Griffin, and midcourter Camilla Lees. During the season, while Katrina Grant was out with injury, they managed to replace her with former Mystics player Rachel Rasmussen. With Rasmussen included to their team, they managed to have close games including the infamous draw against the Mystics and their second win in ANZ Championship history against the Canterbury Tactix. At the Canterbury Tactix, the retirement of captain Julie Seymour left the red and black's midcourt in all sorts of trouble. In addition, they lost Jodi Brown to the Magic and Sonia Mkoloma to the New South Wales Swifts. The Tactix managed to gain Southlander Hayley Crofts, but made no impact. They initially signed out of favour Queensland Firebirds defender Peta Stephens, but an injury ruled her out of contention. As a result, they gained Australian player Chelsea Pitman who previously played for the Swifts before the ANZ Championship. Unfortunately, during the season, the team had the most injuries. With these injuries, the Tactix were forced to bring back Angela Mitchell and Megan Hutton from retirement. They also tried to get England shooter Jo Harten to their lineup as a replacement player for Chelsea Pittman (from ACL) against the Mystics but failed. And down south at the Southern Steel, after the retirements of star players Donna Wilkins, Adine Wilson and Megan Hutton, along with Katrina Grant moving north, it left the Steel in trouble too. They still pulled together a play off potential side. Former Silver Fern and Sting player Leana de Bruin was back from pregnancy and was pulled into the backline. With the re-signing of internationals Daneka Wipiiti, Megan Dehn, Liana Leota, Wendy Frew and Sheryl Scanlan, Steel still had high chances for 2010. During the season, Scanlan received an injury that ended her 2010 season. Australia The Adelaide Thunderbirds gamble to sign Jamaican sharp shooter Carla Borrego (left) proved a success. Up north in Australia, the Queensland Firebirds answered their shooting problems, by snaring Australian Diamonds star Natalie Medhurst from the Adelaide Thunderbirds. She set up a wonderful combination with returning Jamaican import Romelda Aiken. In the Firebird's midcourt, Lauren Nourse led the way without Tamsin Greenway, but gained Vixens's Sarah Wall. In the Firebird's defence, both Peta Stephens and Demelza McCloud weren't included in the 2010 season, but they did gain Vixen's Amy Steel to partner with Australian defender Laura Geitz. Despite Greenway choosing to not return for a third year of ANZ Championships netball, the Firebirds pleaded to have her back to the team when Sarah Wall got a knee injury (ACL) against the Magic. But their efforts failed and were stuck with 11 members for the rest of the season. This ended up costing the Firebirds a spot in the top four for the third year in a row. At the NSW Swifts, after having their worst performance in the last season, with many critics believing Selina Gilsenan's retirement was the reason for their weak defence, the Sydney club picked up touring, English defender Sonia Mkoloma, to give her a third franchise to play at. Mkoloma, again along with Catherine Cox, Susan Pratley, Kimberlee Green, and Rebecca Bulley were the key players to their line-up. The Swifts also gained AIS players Courtney Tairi and Ashleigh Brazill to add in youth to their team. However, the team lost Erin Bell to the Thunderbirds in hopes of gaining more court time in the ANZ Championship. Overall, the team still kept six of their seven members since the inaugural season naming them the most consistent team of them all. Before the season, Kimberley Borger was out due to injury and was replaced by former Jaegar player Lara Welham. During the season, the Swifts lost Vanessa Ware during training from ACL and was replaced with Kristy Guthrie (née Durheim). The Melbourne Vixens opted against bringing in an import, resulting in Ama Agbeze playing for the Pulse. The 2009 champions kept consistency in their line up. Shooters Sharelle McMahon and Caitlin Thwaites, midcourter Natasha Chokljat and defenders Julie Corletto and Bianca Chatfield all inked again with the team. However, at times, injuries happened at crucial times, resulting in the lineup being changed consistently. Julie Corletto had a knee injury that had kept her out for most of the matches (especially in the second half of the season) with Queensland Firebirds defender Demelza McCloud. Also, Natasha Chokjat had a very bad ankle injury that sent her to the sidelines for half of the season, forcing the midcourt to shuffle around. In addition, Caitlin Thwaites form was questioned by the media in the article "Scratch Thwaites", written by former Australian international Eloise Southby-Halbish. Wendy Jones also returned to the team after suffering an injury in 2009. At the Thunderbirds, coach Jane Woodlands-Thompson returned as coach, along with stars Natalie von Bertouch, Kate Beveridge, Mo'onia Gerrard and import Geva Mentor. After the loss of Medhurst, and which speculation since has arisen Woodlands-Thompson wanted rid of her, she was replaced by former netballer, turned basketball player Carla Borrego. The tall Jamaican would become a huge hit. The cash strapped West Coast Fever again kept their coach Jane Searle, and the core group of players. There were no huge changes in the Perth team's line-up, apart from Leah Shoard returning to Australia, after a year with the Steel. However, the team did gained Thunderbirds player Bianca Reddy to replace the injured Josie Janz due to knee injury. The Fever also welcomed back tall shooter Janelle Lawson from the Firebirds.

In his second professional season he reached the last 32 or better in four tournaments, and a year later he reached the last 16 of the World Championship on his Crucible debut, to reach the top 32 of the rankings. He also won the BBC's "Shot of the Championship" that year at the Crucible for a long pot with safety in mind along almost the full length of the table. He then had two poorer seasons, before two quarter-finals in 1991/1992. A year later he reached the top 16, despite not reaching a quarter-final in that season. Roe spent three successive seasons in the Top 16 and reached a highest position of 13th in 1994/1995 (up from, and back down to, no. 16 in 1993/1994 and 1995/1996 respectively). He then plunged directly out of the top 32 after a succession of early defeats, and never regained this status. A run to the last 16 of the China Open was the highlight of Roe's 2005–06 season. He had to win three qualifying matches to secure his position at the Beijing event, where he defeated Li Yin Xi (a wild card) and Paul Hunter, before ultimately losing 5–3 to Joe Swail. In 2006/2007 his best were two last-32 runs,[1] and another followed at the 2008 Welsh Open, the highlight of a solid 2007/2008 season. Conversely he won just two matches in the 2008/2009 season, causing him to drop to no. 62 in the rankings, carrying a very low one-year total of 4320 into 2009/2010. Roe dropped off the tour at the end of the 2009/2010 season, after 24 years as a professional. He moved to Iran, where he currently coaches their national team, and converted to Islam.[2] Dave Roe is now a snooker coach at the Hong Kong Sports Institute for Elite Athletes.

He was initially an officer in the army of Duqaq, the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, together with his father Toghtekin. When the latter took power after Duqaq's death, Buri acted as regent and later became atabeg himself. Damascus's Burid dynasty was named for him. Contents 1 Biography 2 References 2.1 Citations 2.2 Bibliography Biography[edit] Buri is mentioned for the first time in 1099, when Duqaq sent him to take possession of Jableh, a town between Antioch and Tripoli which had rebelled against Fakhr al-Mulk ibn 'Ammar, qādī of Tripoli. Buri however acted as a despotic governor and the population appealed to Fakhr al-Mulk ibn 'Ammar, who captured him. Buri was however treated well and send back to Damascus.[1] In 1102, Raymond of Saint-Gilles besieged Tripoli. Fakhr al-Mulk sued for help to Damascus, but in vain. In 1104 Duqaq died and the power went to his vizier Toghtekin. In 1108 Fakhr al-Mulk went to Baghdad to obtain help from caliph al-Mustazhir, accompanied by Buri. When the two returned in Damascus, they were informed that Tripoli had fallen into Crusaders' hands.[2] In 1110, the eunuch al-Taj Gümüshtegin was deposed for intriguing against Buri's father; his domain around Baalbek was given to Buri.[3] In 1119, Buri led an army against king Baldwin II of Jerusalem, who had raided Adra'āt and halted him on a hill, where the Crusaders entrenched and stood against Buri's assault until he was crushed.[4] On 25 January 1126, Buri fought with his father against the Crusaders at the battle of Marj al-Saffar, but they were defeated by Baldwin II. The Franks suffered heavy losses, and could not march against Damascus, which was then largely undefended.[5] Buri succeeded Toghtekin, uncontested, in February 1128. The following year, his vizier discovered an alleged plot set by the Assassins to deliver Damascus to the Crusaders. Baldwin II, who ignored that the plot had been brought to light, arrived with his army near Damascus and besieged it. The siege lasted until 5 December 1129, when the western troops were forced to retreat after heavy rains had turned the surroundings of the city into a marsh.[6][7] In 1129, Buri assassinated the pro-Nizari vizier Abu Ali Tahir ibn Sa'id al-Mazadaqani. A general attack on the Assassins of Damascus occurred during the subsequent chaotic disorders and 6,000 or 10,000 of them were slain by the militia and the mob.[7] In 7 May 1131, two Assassins of Buri's personal guard, probably sent from Alamut for that purpose, tried to kill him, and he was severely wounded. Despite the care of Damascus' best physicians, he accelerated his convalescence. After riding a horse, his wound opened back, causing his death in 9 June 1132.[8][7] He was succeeded by his three sons Shams al-Mulk Isma'il, Shihab ed-Din Mahmud, and Jamal ad-Din Muhammad who fought one another over the inheritance.

He topped the Somerset averages in 1966 and 1968. After retiring as a player he went on to become a first-class cricket umpire and he umpired in 20 Test matches and 28 One-Day Internationals before retiring from that at the age of 65 in 2005. Contents 1 Background and early cricket career 2 Somerset regular 3 See also 4 References Background and early cricket career[edit] Kitchen was born in Nailsea, Somerset where his father played local club cricket.[2] He was educated locally at Backwell Secondary Modern School. He joined the playing staff at Somerset County Cricket Club as a 16-year-old in 1957 and appeared in the next three seasons for the county's second eleven in Minor Counties matches and, from 1959, in games in the newly constituted Second Eleven Championship.[3][4] He made his debut for the Somerset first eleven in 1960 as a middle-order batsman, but made little impact in that or the next season, and in 1962 and 1963, although he played in around half of Somerset's first-class matches, his batting average was below 20 and his place was often dependent on injuries to other players. At this stage in his career, he was primarily a defensive batsman "which suited neither his temperament, for he was not a selfish man, nor his technique", according to one history of Somerset cricket.[5] He played in most of Somerset's matches in the 1964 season and finally averaged more than 20 runs per innings, but returned to inconsistent performances and an uncertain place in the team in 1965.[6] Somerset regular[edit] At the end of the 1965 season, Peter Wight, who had been a fixture in the Somerset side since 1955, batting at No 3, but whose form had declined markedly in the previous three seasons, was not re-engaged for the following year. The resulting vacancy in the Somerset batting line-up in 1966 was filled by Kitchen and he responded with his most successful season, finishing top of the county's batting averages with 1422 runs in all first-class matches.[6] The batting style had changed as well, and Kitchen was a much more attacking player than he had been, exemplified by an innings in July in a non-first-class match against the International Cavaliers team at Bath, where he won the match by hitting both of the last two balls of a 38-over match from the South African Test bowler Neil Adcock for six.[7] After this innings, Kitchen became a much more confident batsman and in the space of just over a week at the end of the season he made his first two first-class centuries and was awarded his county cap: "Until then in 142 innings he had not scored a century and had averaged under 20," says the history of Somerset cricket.[5] See also[edit] List of Test cricket umpires List of One Day International cricket umpires References[edit] ^ "Mervyn Kitchen". www.cricketarchive.com.

In the 1980s and 1990s, St. Thomas was one of the city’s most dangerous and impoverished housing developments. It made national headlines in 1992 after the deadly shooting of Eric Boyd. In 1982 Helen Prejean moved into the St. Thomas development in order to live and work with the poor. While there, Sister Helen began corresponding with Patrick Sonnier, who had been sentenced to death for the murder of two teenagers. After witnessing the executions, she sat down and wrote a book, Dead Man Walking. The book inspired the 1995 film Dead Man Walking. In 1998 the project was demolished and replaced with mixed income "River Garden."[1] Contents 1 History 2 Demographics 3 Crime and violence 3.1 Shooting of Eric Boyd 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The St. Thomas was one of the oldest housing projects of New Orleans. It was bordered by St. Thomas Street to the south, a service alley between Constance and Laurel Streets to the north, Felicity Street to the east, and Josephine Street to the west. St. Thomas housing development was originally designated for white occupants only. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all of the city’s public housing projects were desegregated. At that time, the residents were a group of racially diverse, low-income, working-class families. In the mid/late 60s, many of these families were forced out when the federal government decided that their income was too high. At the same time, there was a decrease in social services in the housing developments – a decrease many attribute to the money going into the Vietnam war.[2] The exodus of industry from the inner city plunged the St. Thomas residents into great poverty, and subsequent White flight meant that, in recent years, residents have been primarily African American. Living conditions and crime became a problem during the mid-1970s when Heroin flooded the project. Problems in St. Thomas continued throughout the '80s and '90s. In 1996, the Housing Authority of New Orleans received a H.U.D. Hope VI grant to demolish and rebuild the area. The grant included the costs of relocating the nearly 3,000 then-residents to other properties. By the end of 2001, all of the buildings except a few had been demolished to create a mixed-income neighborhood named "River Garden." A section of Chippewa Street was re-aligned in the process. Also, a new Wal-Mart superstore was constructed on long-vacant property one block south of the former project site.[3] Surviving buildings from old St. Thomas Projects, New Orleans. Construction of the rental property was completed in early 2009, with a final phase of construction focusing on condominiums and ground floor retail space. The plans for condominiums did not materialize and were substituted with additional subsidized rental property. Single-family housing was built near the center of the development. HRI, the developer, built approximately one-third of the planned number of single-family homes. At the time of the writing, there were no plans to finish this aspect of the River Garden neighborhood. Demographics[edit] As of the census of 2000, there were 2,957 people, 834 households, and 608 families residing in the neighborhood.[4] The population density was 12,857 /mi² (4,928 /km²). As of the census of 2010, there were 2,161 people, 1,001 households, and 471 families residing in the neighborhood.[4] Crime and violence[edit] The St. Thomas Housing Development was often considered one of the most dangerous housing projects in the country in the 1980s.[5] Many residents boarded up their windows to prevent stray bullets from coming through.[6] Police were also hesitant driving through St. Thomas and would often avoid passing down St Thomas Street for their own safety.[7] In 1989, a stray bullet hit and killed a 5-year-old boy as well as injuring a 4-year-old girl. The bullet was not intended for the children, and hit the girl's shoulder while she played in a courtyard during a birthday party. Another 4-year-old girl was hit in the stomach as she played on her porch, and an 8-year-old girl was hit in the legs with a shotgun blast.[8] In 1991, St. Thomas led all housing projects in rates of violent crime, according to the Housing Authority. From 1987 and 1991, St. Thomas tenants reported 48 murders, 27 rapes, 370 robberies and 638 assaults.[9][10] Shooting of Eric Boyd[edit] On the morning of October 23, 1992 4-year old Eric Boyd was struck by a stray bullet in a courtyard in the St. Thomas Project. According to police, Boyd was stepping outside to walk to preschool when gunfire erupted in front of him in the courtyard. As the 4-year-old's family yelled for him to duck inside, a stray bullet pierced the wooden door frame and struck Eric in the chest.[11] See also[edit] New Orleans neighborhoods References[edit] ^ https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-apr-21-na-projects21-story.html ^ "St. Thomas Development Neighborhood Snapshot".

There have been a number of nuclear whistleblowers, often nuclear engineers, who have identified safety concerns about nuclear power and nuclear weapons production. In 1976 Gregory Minor, Richard Hubbard and Dale Bridenbaugh "blew the whistle" on safety problems at nuclear power plants in the United States, and Fukushima in Japan. George Galatis was a senior nuclear engineer who reported safety problems at the Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant, relating to reactor refueling procedures, in 1996.[1] Other nuclear power whistleblowers include Arnold Gundersen and David Lochbaum.

Perkins 15 John Pace and Dan Parks 16 Other nuclear whistleblowers 17 See also 18 References 19 External links Karen Silkwood[edit] Main article: Karen Silkwood The first prominent nuclear whistleblower was Karen Silkwood, who worked as a chemical technician at a Kerr-McGee nuclear fuel plant. Silkwood became an activist in the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union in order to protest health and safety issues. In 1974, she testified to the United States Atomic Energy Commission about her concerns.[2] A few months later she died in a car crash under mysterious conditions on the way to a meeting with a New York Times reporter and a national union leader.[3] The 1983 film Silkwood is an account of this story. The "GE Three"[edit] Main article: GE Three On 2 February 1976, Gregory C. Minor, Richard B. Hubbard, and Dale G. Bridenbaugh (known as the GE Three) "blew the whistle" on safety problems at nuclear power plants, and their action has been called "an exemplary instance of whistleblowing".[4] The three engineers gained the attention of journalists and their disclosures about the threats of nuclear power had a significant impact. They timed their statements to coincide with their resignations from responsible positions in General Electric's nuclear energy division, and later established themselves as consultants on the nuclear power industry for state governments, federal agencies, and overseas governments. The consulting firm they formed, MHB Technical Associates, was technical advisor for the movie, "The China Syndrome." The three engineers participated in Congressional hearings which their disclosures precipitated.[5][6] Browns Ferry Unit 1 under construction Browns Ferry nuclear power plant construction began in 1966. It was located in Alabama and in 1967 it earned a federal construction permit. The plant received new design standards which call for "physical separation of electrical cables." [7] There was an issue with the instructions on how to accomplish this so the AEC inspector F.U. Bower requested that the AEC elaborate; however, there was no response from the organization and installation went on. Still, no instructions were issued after five failed inspections in 1970. The lack of cable separation instructions led to the sacrifice of safety coolant systems in two of the units in order to improve one with severe safety violation. The ignorance of the AEC led to the fire that occurred on 22 March 1975, that almost led to a radiation leak. The substance separating the wires caught fire when tests to find air leaks with a candle ignited it thus resulting in damage to the control systems. With damage to the control systems, the cooling system that keeps the units from leaking radiation did not work properly. Somehow the situation was avoided and the units were put out of service. Throughout the occurrence of these events Bridenbaugh had been discussing his reservations on the safety at the plant in vain and in 1976 a year later Bridenbaugh, Hubbard and Minor resigned. Crystal River 3 and Lou Putney[edit] Main article: Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant Lou Putney came on the scene of the Crystal River 3 plant after receiving a call from a plant engineer. The engineer claimed that the managers hired engineers based on "good ol' boy mentality."[8] The plant had experience numerous shut downs since 1978. Along with this concern, the engineer was not confident that the manager possessed the qualifications to be a manager. Although the engineer pursued nothing further with his complaint, it prompted Putney to purchase shares of stock in the company that would allow him to file "shareholder resolutions." Putney had looked into the nuclear reactors that were built of an unsafe material for emergency cooling procedures. The NRC had placed Crystal River on the top 14 worst reactors list because of this. So, the shares were purchased in 1981, which is when Putney filed his first shareholder resolution requesting the plant be shut down. This tradition was upheld by Putney for seven years until he was required to purchase more stock in order to continue filing resolutions. Over the course of sixteen years, Putney filed a total of fourteen shareholder resolutions. All of these resolutions were ignored and were met with offers to buy out his shares so he could no longer file the resolutions.[8] The plant was officially decommissioned in September 2009. Ronald Goldstein[edit] Ronald J. Goldstein was a supervisor employed by EBASCO, which was a major contractor for the construction of the South Texas plants. In the summer of 1985, Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM, an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting, including noncompliance with safety procedures, the failure to issue safety compliance reports, and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant. SAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns. The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection. After he filed his report to SAFETEAM, Goldstein was fired. Subsequently, Goldstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes.[9] The U.S. Department of Labor ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid, a finding upheld by Labor Secretary Lynn Martin. The ruling was appealed and overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that private programs offered no protection to whistleblowers. After Goldstein lost his case, Congress amended the federal nuclear whistleblower law to provide protection reports made to internal systems and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers.[10] Fernald Nuclear Incidents[edit] Aerial view of Fernald Feed Materials Production Center Uranium components fabricated at Fernald Main article: Fernald Feed Materials Production Center The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center was built in Crosby Township, Ohio in 1951, and decommissioned in 1989. Fernald processed uranium trioxide and uranium tetrafluoride, among other radioactive materials, to produce the uranium fuel cores for nuclear weapons. It was shrouded in suspicion with many manager changes and the people of the town ill-informed of the purpose of the plant.[11] The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center also conducted an evaluation of how much material was contaminated by Radium. Using 138 pieces of the CR-39 film assays, they were able to determine that people working in the area where K-65 silos ( Underground chamber used to store missiles) had lower levels of exposure of materials contaminated by Radon than the Q-11 silos between the period of 1952-1988 Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology.Throughout 1951-1995 the plant had numerous scandals including faking numbers for contamination and disregarding evidence of ground water pollution. Among the citizens affected by the pollution was Mrs. Lisa Crawford who took action. Crawford and other residents filed a lawsuit in 1985 and became president of the organization FRESH (Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety and Health).[12] A lawsuit was then filed once again against Fernald by former employees several years later in 1990. After several years of being heavily advised not to blow the whistle, the workers earned themselves a $15 million settlement and lifelong medical monitoring.[12] In 1992, FERMCO was hired to construct a cleanup plan for the plant and in 1996, around accusations of wasteful spending, the cleanup of ground water and soil was completed.[12] Mordechai Vanunu[edit] Mordechai Vanunu 2009 Main article: Mordechai Vanunu Mordechai Vanunu blew the whistle on the nuclear plant in Dimona, Israel in an interview with The Sunday Times that was published on 5 October 1986. According to Vanunu, this plant had been producing nuclear weapons for 10 to 20 years.[13] It is estimated that there may be around 200 nuclear weapons in possession of Israel's nuclear weapons program.[14] Vanunu demonstrated his knowledge to Frank Barnaby and Theodore Taylor, and they confirmed the credibility of his story. Frank Barnaby wrote in his Declaration of Frank Barnaby in the Matter of Mordechai Vanunu that Vanunu had the bare minimum knowledge of nuclear physics that a technician should have and accurately described the makeup of the nuclear plant in Dimona.[15] Having served in full his 18 years prison term, ruled in closed door trial, including 11 years in solitary Vanunu has been further in and out of jail after. In 2007, sentenced to six months for violating terms of his parole, and in May 2010, again to three months for having met foreigners in violation of his release terms from jail. Vanunu is ethnic Mizrahi Jew, born in Marrakesh Morocco, having emigrated to Israel, following its independence in 1948, like many of the North African Jewish community did. Amnesty International issued a press release on 2 July 2007, stating that "The organisation considers Mordechai Vanunu to be a prisoner of conscience and calls for his immediate and unconditional release."[6] Vanunu has been characterized internationally as a whistleblower[7][8] and by Israel as a traitor. Despite the whistle blown towards the operation of the nuclear weapons program in Israel, the Israeli government denied the existence of all allegations.[16] Mordechai Vanunu is known as Israel`s Nuclear Whistleblower.[17] Arnold Gundersen[edit] Main article: Arnold Gundersen In 1990 Arnold Gundersen discovered radioactive material in an accounting safe at Nuclear Energy Services in Danbury, Connecticut, the consulting firm where he held a $120,000-a-year job as senior vice-president.[18] Three weeks after he notified the company president of what he believed to be radiation safety violations, Gundersen was fired. According to The New York Times, for three years, Gundersen "was awakened by harassing phone calls in the middle of the night" and he "became concerned about his family's safety". Gundersen believes he was blacklisted, harassed and fired for doing what he thought was right.[18] The New York Times reports that Gundersen's case is not uncommon, especially in the nuclear industry. Even though nuclear workers are encouraged to report potential safety hazards, those who do risk demotion and dismissal. Instead of correcting the problems, whistleblowers say, industry management and government agencies attack them as the cause of the problem. Driven out of their jobs and shunned by neighbors and co-workers, whistleblowers often turn to each other for support.[18] The Whistleblower Support Fund is an organization that has compiled resources for whistleblowers to access if they are considering whistleblowing. It was founded by Donald Ray Soeken, who has counseled whistleblowers for 35 years. In addition, a social network to connect whistleblowers to other whistleblowers will be implemented. It will be a private discussion where whistleblowers can safely seek support.[19] David Lochbaum[edit] Main article: David Lochbaum In the early 1990s, nuclear engineer David Lochbaum and a colleague, Don Prevatte, identified a safety problem in a plant where they were working, but were ignored when they raised the issue with the plant manager, the utility and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).[20] After bringing their concerns to Congress, the problem was corrected not just at the original nuclear plant but at plants across the country.[21] Gerald W. Brown[edit] Main article: Gerald W. Brown Gerald W. Brown Gerald W. Brown was the whistleblower on the Thermo-Lag scandal, as well as on silicone foam firestop issues in the US and Canada, exposing the fact that fireproofing of wiring between control rooms and reactors did not function as intended and exposing bounding and combustibility issues with organic firestops. George Galatis[edit] Main article: George Galatis George Galatis was a senior nuclear engineer and whistleblower who reported safety problems at the Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant, relating to reactor refueling procedures, in 1996.[1][22] The unsafe procedures meant that spent fuel rod pools at Unit 1 had the potential to boil, possibly releasing radioactive steam throughout the plant.[23] Galatis eventually took his concerns to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to find that they had "known about the unsafe procedures for years". As a result of going to the NRC, Galatis experienced "subtle forms of harassment, retaliation, and intimidation".[22] Rainer Moormann[edit] Rainer Moormann in 2004 Rainer Moormann is a German chemist and nuclear power whistleblower. Since 1976 he has been working at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, doing research on safety problems with pebble bed reactors, fusion power and spallation neutron sources. In 2008 Moormann published a critical paper on the safety of pebble bed reactors,[24][25] which raised attention among specialists in the field, and managed to distribute it via the media, facing considerable opposition. For doing this despite the occupational disadvantages he had to accept as a consequence, Moormann was awarded the whistleblower award of the Federation of German Scientists (VDW)[26] and of the German section of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms (IALANA). Setsuo Fujiwara[edit] Setsuo Fujiwara, who used to design reactors, said he clashed with supervisors over an inspection audit he conducted in March 2009 at the Tomari nuclear plant in Japan. Fujiwara refused to approve a routine test by the plant's operator, Hokkaido Electric Power, saying the test was flawed. A week later, he was summoned by his supervisor, who ordered him to correct his written report to indicate that the test had been done properly. After Fujiwara refused, his employment contract was not renewed. "They told me my job was just to approve reactors, not to raise doubts about them", said Fujiwara, 62, who is now suing the nuclear safety organization to get rehired. In a written response to questions from The New York Times, the agency said it could not comment while the court case was under way.[27] Along with the lawsuit Mr. Fujiwara filed against the agency he used to work for, he had gone to the Tokyo District Court to further write several complaints about how the JNES ( Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization) failed to follow the UN laws concerning how to properly inspect nuclear energy reactors. Mr. Fujiwara also submitted several documents and emails that dealt with how the reactor inspections were improperly handled by JNES even though JNES denies all allegations. [42] Walter Tamosaitis[edit] The Hanford site resulted in a number of whistleblowers during the efforts to clean the site up. Walter Tamosaitis blew the whistle on the Energy Department's plan for waste treatment at the Hanford site in 2011. Tamosaitis's concern was the possibility of explosive hydrogen gas being built up inside tanks that the company was to store the harmful chemical sludge they were trying to put into hibernation for its chemical life. Shortly after this Tamosaitis was demoted and two years later, fired which triggered his lawsuit for wrongful termination. A $4.1 million settlement was offered to Tamosaitis from AECOM on 12 August 2015.[28] Tamosaitis has since been reinstated. Donna Busche blew the whistle resulting in her 2013 lawsuit with claims that the URS "retaliated against her.[28] She was head of nuclear safety and a URS employee around the time when she expressed her concerns.[29][30] Gary Brunson reported 34 safety and engineering violations after quitting in 2012. Brunson was federal engineering chief before he quit.[31] Shelly Doss earned "$20,000 in emotional distress and $10,000 in callous disregard of her rights" as well as reinstatement in 2014.[28] Doss was an environmental specialist at the time of her firing in 2011 working for Washington River Protection Solutions. Larry Criscione and Richard H. Perkins[edit] In 2012, Larry Criscione and Richard H. Perkins publicly accused the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission of downplaying flood risks for nuclear plants which are sited on waterways downstream from large reservoirs and dams. They are engineers with over 20 years of combined government and military service who work for the NRC. Other nuclear safety advocates have supported their complaints.[32] John Pace and Dan Parks[edit] In 1959, John Pace was employed at the Santa Susana Field Lab, 36 miles from Los Angeles, at the time of the partial meltdown during the Sodium Reactor Experiment. According to Pace, the reactor building doors and reactor exhaust stack were opened, releasing radiation into the atmosphere. Dan Parks also worked at the Santa Susana Field Lab, as a health physicist in the 1960s, where he witnessed the burning of radioactive waste in burn pits, and frequently saw workers illegally vent radiation into the atmosphere. In 2015 they spoke out about the incident in an investigative report by NBC News.[33][34] Other nuclear whistleblowers[edit] Chuck Atkinson[35] Dale G.

Session (Father, deceased)Criminal chargeRape (posthumously overturned) Timothy Brian Cole (July 1, 1960 – December 2, 1999) was an African-American military veteran and a Texas Tech University student wrongfully convicted of raping a fellow student in 1985. Cole attended two years of college followed by two years of service in the U.S. Army. After his Army service, he returned to college at Texas Tech in Lubbock.[1] Cole died after serving 14 years in prison, but was posthumously pardoned. Contents 1 Crime and aftermath 2 Legislation 3 Memorials and posthumous degree 4 See also 5 References 6 Further reading 7 External links Crime and aftermath[edit] On March 24, 1985, Michele Mallin, a student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, had just parked her car when she was accosted by a man, forced back into the car, and raped.[2] The rape was one of a number of similar attacks in the area at the time. Police showed photographs of potential suspects to Mallin, including one of Cole, another student at Texas Tech. She picked his photograph and later picked him out from an identity parade.[1] Cole was convicted by a jury of rape, primarily based on the testimony of the victim. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. While incarcerated, he was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused.[1] Cole died in prison on December 2, 1999, during an asthma attack. His family, later joined by the victim, sought to clear his name through the Innocence Project of Texas.[2] Another man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape multiple times, starting in 1995.[2] Further, Mallin later admitted that she was mistaken as to the identity of her attacker. Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe asthma. DNA evidence later showed him to be innocent.[2] Johnson confirmed in court that he was the rapist and asked the victim and Cole's family to forgive him. "It's been on my heart to express my sincerest sorrow and regret and ask to be forgiven," said Johnson, who is serving life in prison for two other 1985 rapes. However, Johnson cannot be charged in the Mallin case because the statute of limitations has expired.[3][4] On February 6, 2009, a Texas district court judge announced "to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. The judge, Charlie Baird, reversed the conviction and ordered Cole's record expunged.[3][4] It was the first posthumous DNA exoneration in the history of the state of Texas.[5] Cole's exoneration led to numerous changes in Texas law. Legislation[edit] The Texas Senate passed legislation to exonerate Cole. The Texas House of Representatives bill passed through committee and then the full house. After that, it went to Governor Rick Perry to be signed into law.[6][7] Another bill, named after Cole, was passed by the legislature and sent to the governor on May 11, 2009. It made those who are falsely convicted of a crime eligible for $160,000 for each year of incarceration—half paid as a lump sum, and half paid out over the claimant’s lifetime as an annuity[8]—and provide them with free college tuition.[9][10] Texas law firm Glasheen, Valles & Inderman also worked with Texas Senator John Cornyn to convince the United States Internal Revenue Service that compensation for incarceration stemming from a wrongful conviction should not be treated as taxable income, that instead it should be treated the same as compensation for personal injuries which is not taxable income.[11] This ultimately led to the passing of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.[12] The bill also established the Timothy Cole Advisory Panel on Wrongful Convictions. A panel set up to study the causes of wrongful convictions and to devise ways of preventing them is to report to the Texas governor no later than 2011.[13] While Perry stated he wanted to issue a pardon, he felt that he was not legally able to do so. However, on January 7, 2010, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott issued an opinion which cleared the way for the governor to pardon Cole.[14] On March 2, 2010, Governor Perry granted Timothy Cole the state's first posthumous pardon. On May 19, 2015 Governor Greg Abbott signed the Tim Cole Exoneration Review Commission into law. The Tim Cole Commission will review past exonerations and make recommendations to the Texas Legislature regarding criminal justice reform. Memorials and posthumous degree[edit] Historical marker at Cole's grave On February 3, 2012, on the third anniversary of Cole's exoneration, the State of Texas unveiled a historical marker at his grave. In June 2012, the Lubbock City Council voted to honor Cole with a memorial. The statue, created by Lubbock-based sculptor Eddie Dixon[15], is the first of its kind to recognize a wrongfully convicted person.[16] The $250,000, 19-foot (5.8 m) bronze and granite statue, paid for by local attorney Kevin Glasheen, is located at 2500 19 Street, and was unveiled in September 2014.[17] During the first week of March 2015, the Texas Tech University System Board of Regents approved for Cole an honorary degree in law and social justice. A ceremony was held on May 15, 2015.[18][19] See also[edit] Innocent prisoner's dilemma List of wrongful convictions in the United States References[edit] ^ a b c Lavandera, Ed (2009-02-05).

It was produced by former Pixies producer Gil Norton. While not all that successful commercially, Chrome has been well received by critics. Contents 1 Background 2 Promotion and release 3 Reception 4 Track listing 5 Singles 6 Personnel 7 Charts 8 References 9 External links Background[edit] Chrome was intended by the band to be a departure into more hard rock territory when compared to their debut, Ferment. Bassist Dave Hawes explained, "The main thing I remember when going to record Chrome was that we didn't just want to make Ferment 2. And through continually touring between Ferment and going into record Chrome we had evolved into a harder sounding band. It just seemed a natural process and so Chrome turned into a harder sounding album and I think Gil Norton was the perfect producer for us at that point of time. We went in with the songs well-rehearsed and I really enjoyed recording Chrome especially doing it in Britannia Row Studios where Joy Division had recorded Closer (a personal favourite band and album of mine)".[2] The album cover photo was shot in an indoor swimming pool by Storm Thorgerson of the Hipgnosis design company. In 1999, the cover of this album appeared as the cover of the Hipgnosis/Thorgerson retrospective book Eye of the Storm: The Album Graphics of Storm Thorgerson (Sanctuary Publishing). The CD version was also available in a limited edition version with a shiny chrome-looking cover with embossed writing on it. The track "Ursa Major Space Station" was named after a guitar effects pedal,[3] while "Fripp" was named after King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp. Promotion and release[edit] Chrome peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart.[4] It was supported by the single "Crank", a No. 5 Modern Rock Tracks hit.[5] Music videos were filmed for singles "Crank", "Show Me Mary" and "The Nude". The video for "Crank" featured the band playing in a hotel elevator and lobby to a motley cast of hotel guests, with several scenes emulating the persecution, death, and resurrection of Jesus; "Show Me Mary" had the band being driven around in a taxi; "The Nude" featured the smearing of wet clay across a topless woman's torso. Catherine Wheel embarked on tours with Slowdive, Chapterhouse and INXS, among others, to promote this album. Reception[edit] Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[6]Entertainment WeeklyB+[7]NME7/10[8]Q[9] Melody Maker described Chrome as "a tighter, more robust affair" than Ferment and "perhaps the ultimate Catherine Wheel album".[10] NME called it "a triumph".[8] In Trouser Press, Jack Rabid wrote that the album "combines songwriting prowess with more raging playing, pop tunes gone kablooey and a huge bonfire sound with a faint metal edge."[11] Writing in The Rough Guide to Rock, Anna Robinson was less favourable, describing much of the album's material as "comparatively lightweight" compared to Ferment.[12] "Crank" was included in PopMatters' 2010 list of the "Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s".[13] In 2016, Chrome was placed 9th in Pitchfork's list of "The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time".[1] Track listing[edit] All tracks are written by Rob Dickinson and Brian Futter.No.TitleLength1."Kill Rhythm"3:512."I Confess"3:563."Crank"3:454."Broken Head"4:435."Pain"6:316."Strange Fruit"3:067."Chrome"3:538."The Nude"3:519."Ursa Major Space Station"5:0910."Fripp"7:3411."Half Life"4:0812."Show Me Mary"3:19 Singles[edit] "Crank" (1993) UK 12" vinyl picture disc "Crank" – 3:46 "Black Metallic" (Peel Session 1991) – 7:55 "Painful Thing" (Peel Session 1991) – 5:52 Netherlands CD single "Crank" – 3:45 "Come Back Again" – 4:24 UK CD single 1 "Crank" – 3:45 "La La Lala La" – 5:26 "Pleasure" – 5:22 "Tongue Twisted" – 4:50 UK CD single 2 "Crank" – 3:45 "La La Lala La" – 5:26 "Something Strange" – 1:46 UK CD single 3 "Crank" – 3:45 "Pleasure" – 5:22 "Tongue Twisted" – 4:50 UK cassette single (same two tracks on each side) "Crank" – 3:45 "Come Back Again" – 4:24 "Show Me Mary" (1993) UK CD single 1 "Show Me Mary" – 3:22 "These Four Walls" – 5:22 "Smother" – 7:09 UK CD single 2 "Show Me Mary" – 3:23 "Car" – 6:44 "Girl Stand Still" – 8:09 US promo CD single "Show Me Mary (Scott Litt Remix)" – 3:18 "Wish You Were Here" (Pink Floyd cover) – 2:56 UK 12" vinyl single, vinyl promo single and promo CD single "Show Me Mary" – 3:19 "High Heels" – 3:35 "Mouth Full of Air" – 2:42 UK 7" vinyl single "Show Me Mary" – 3:23 "Flower to Hide (Live)" – 5:03 "The Nude" (1993) UK promo CD single "The Nude (Scott Litt Remix)" – 4:05 Personnel[edit] Rob Dickinson – vocals, guitar Brian Futter – guitar, vocals Dave Hawes – bass guitar Neil Sims – percussion Tim Friese-Greene – Hammond organ Gil Norton – production John Lee – production, engineering Charts[edit] Chart (1993) Peakposition UK Albums (OCC)[14] 58 US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard)[4] 26 References[edit] ^ a b "The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time".

Later he served in the RAF as a photographer. On leaving the RAF he obtained a job with British Transport Films (BTF), filming all forms of transportation.[4] After this, it was to Iraq (where he later shot the opening scenes to The Exorcist, 1973), filming for the Iraq Petroleum Company. At this time he owned his own Arriflex camera. He spent several years in documentary work, hoping that one day he could break into features. Before his feature debut, he became a cameraman on commercials, where he made contact with future directors Ken Russell and John Schlesinger (who had directed for BTF as well).[5] In 1965 he shot his first feature as director of photography, having by-passed the focus puller and operator stages. His first feature offering was San Ferry Ann. He made several others before shooting Billion Dollar Brain with Russell in 1967.[1] Williams can be seen in a cameo in the film The Wind and the Lion (1975), playing a British nobleman living in Tangier who is killed in a shootout with Sean Connery's Berber tribesmen. He also appeared with Cher in 1987's Suspect. Williams retired on New Year's Day 1996. Since retirement he has travelled, conducting workshops on film. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours.[6] Williams is featured in a new book on cinematographers called Conversations with Cinematographers by David A Ellis and published by Scarecrow Press, which is part of the Rowman and Littlefield publishing group.[7] Selected filmography[edit] 1965: San Ferry Ann 1967: Billion Dollar Brain 1968: 30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia 1968: The Magus 1969: Women in Love 1970: Tam-Lin 1971: Sunday Bloody Sunday 1973: The Glass Menagerie 1973: The Exorcist 1975: The Wind and the Lion 1976: Voyage of the Damned 1977: The Devil's Advocate 1978: The Silent Partner 1979: Going in Style 1981: On Golden Pond 1982: Gandhi 1983: The Survivors 1984: Ordeal by Innocence 1985: Dreamchild 1987: Suspect 1989: The Rainbow 1990: Stella References[edit] ^ a b "Billy Williams". ^ "BSC Members - British Society of Cinematographers". bscine.com. ^ "Billy Williams - Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos - AllMovie".

For example, training software such as simulators are often used to help prepare first responders, word processors can keep form templates handy for printing and analytical software can be used to perform post-hoc examinations of the data captured during an incident. All of these systems are interrelated, as the results of an after-incident analysis can then be used to program training software to better prepare for a similar situation in the future. Crisis Information Management Software (CIMS) is the software found in emergency management operation centers (EOC) that supports the management of crisis information and the corresponding response by public safety agencies.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Characteristics 2.1 Interoperability 2.2 Crisis and emergency modeling and simulation 3 See also 4 References History[edit] Although such software had existed prior to 9/11, after 2001 there was a significant increase in focus on emergency management. A 2001 study by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) compared software features from 10 vendors. In 2004, the Institute for Security Technology Studies published a report addressing the interoperability of different software, which has remained a strong focus in the development of software for the Emergency Management field. To support National Incident Management System implementation, the Department of Homeland Security established the National Incident Management System Support Center (NIMS SC) and the Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (STEP) in 2005. In 2007 a study similar to the National Institute of Justice report was conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF).[2] In 2008 the United States Air Force and the University of Colorado Center for Homeland Security surveyed several hundred Emergency Management personnel seeking to prioritize user requirements.[3] Characteristics[edit] Common features of the software include Geographic Information Systems (GIS), weather and plume modeling, resource management, and Command, Control, and Communication (C3) functions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) supports evaluation of software through the National Incident Management System Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (NIMS STEP). As of October 1, 2013 the FEMA P-TAC Center (formally the NIMSSC) is no longer taking applications for STEP.[4] The National Preparedness Directorate Incident Management Systems Integration Division (NPD-IMSI) identifies criteria for this program to evaluate against. These criteria are derived primarily from the National Incident Management System.[5] For example: Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) as per National Response Framework (NRF) definition Incident Command Functions as per National Incident Management System Resource Management (preparedness, incident response, post-incident recovery, reimbursement) All-hazards philosophy as per the National Incident Management System Specific hazards identified as per National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600: Standard on Disaster / Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs Standardized framework / Common Operating Picture as per National Incident Management System Scalability as per National Incident Management System Command and Management – Incident Command System (ICS) as per National Incident Management System FEMA currently uses WebEOC as its emergency management software. [6] Interoperability[edit] The primary focus of these standards is interoperability. A lack of interoperability was identified as a key drawback (although not limited in scope to the software) in a National Institute of Justice feature comparison report conducted in 2001. In 2004, the Federal Emergency Management Agency created the National Incident Management System which addresses interoperability by providing standardized definitions for different software to utilize. The National Incident Management System prescribes several required features that these systems must incorporate.[7] American National Standards Institute InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (ANSI INCITS) 398-2005: Information Technology – Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1512-2006: Standard for Common Incident Management Message Sets for Use by Emergency Management Centers National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1221: Standard for Installation, Maintenance, and Use of Emergency Services Communications Systems Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.1 Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) Emergency Data Exchange Language (EDXL) Distribution Element v1.0 Crisis and emergency modeling and simulation[edit] Software simulation is mainly used in the preparedness phase of the emergency management process. Simulation can be performed both to analyze possible emergency scenarios, to evaluate recovery strategies and to train institutional or private operators in better facing a crisis. Simulations can deal with weather and climate forecasting, landslides, ash clouds propagation, earthquake impact, cyber attacks, people behavior, and critical infrastructures. Precondition to simulation is modeling. Furthermore, an increasing interest is in simulating socio-technical systems where the impact of an emergency (e.g., due to a natural disaster) should be considered on both infrastructures and population. For this purpose, a novel approach is to adopt domain-specific modeling techniques in order to support representation of a crisis scenario as an executable model.[8][9][10] See also[edit] Emergency management Emergency Communication System Emergency management information system (EMIS) EDXL Sharp References[edit] ^ Crisis Information Management System (CIMS) Feature Comparison Report National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, US Department of Justice 2001 ^ Commercial Emergency Management Software: Evaluation Methods and Findings Office of GeoIntegration, Air Force Space Command 2007 ^ USAF Emergency and Incident Management Systems: A Systematic Analysis of Functional Requirements Robillard & Sambrook 2008 ^ "Archived copy".

Estimates using redshift put the galaxy at about 59 million light years (18 megaparsecs) away.[3] It was discovered on 14 April 1789 by William Herschel,[6] and it was described as "pretty faint, small, round" by John Louis Emil Dreyer, the compiler of the New General Catalogue.[7] NGC 3921 is the remnant of a galaxy merger. The two progenitor galaxies are thought to have been disk galaxies that collided about 700 million years ago.[8] The image shows noticeable star formation and structures like loops, indicative of galaxies interacting.[8] Because of this, NGC 3921 was included in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the designation Arp 224.[4] Being a starburst galaxy, NGC 3921 has important features. One of them is an ultraluminous X-ray source, designated X-2, with an X-ray luminosity of 8×1039 erg/s.[9] Additionally, two candidates globular clusters have been detected within NGC 3921.[5] They are both fairly young, and are about half as massive as Omega Centauri: this demonstrates that mergers of gas-rich galaxies can also create more metal-rich globular clusters.[5] References[edit] ^ a b Skrutskie, M.

In April 2014, the record was reassigned back to Tim Vine following a decision from Guinness World Record officials. An official spokesman said that Anthony Lehmann had breached the guidelines.[8] Radio[edit] SAFM[edit] In 2003, Lehmo’s radio career started as co-host of SAFM breakfast show in Adelaide with Lisa "Milly" Millard.[9] In July 2020, Lehmo returned to SAFM to host breakfast alongside Rebecca Morse and Andrew Costello 'Cosi'.

It was built around 1901 as an elaborate residence for a wealthy businessman, then in 1972 sold to the city of Las Palmas for use as a music conservatory. The restored building is now a cultural center. Contents 1 Construction 2 Usage 3 Notes 4 Sources Construction[edit] The Palacete Rodríguez Quegles is at the corner of Pérez Galdós and Perdomo streets on a lot that held the orchard of the old Monastery of the Concepción Bernarda. Juan Rodríguez Quegles was a well-known lawyer, merchant, landowner and president of the Mercantile Society.[1] He had been born in Fuerteventura but then moved to Gran Canaria, from where he ran large businesses.[2] He loved European culture. He conceived the sumptuous palace as a gift of love to his wife, María Teresa González Díaz.[1] He had promised her the most beautiful house in the city.[2] The palace was built in the modernist style. The work was assigned to the Madrid architect Mariano Belmás Estrada.[3] Belmás advised Fernando Navarro y Navarro.[4] Navarro finally took over and executed the project.[1][5] Construction started in 1900. There is no record of the year of completion. The resulting mansion was completely eclectic in style, with foreign architectural and decorative styles typical of the tastes of the bourgeois of that period.[1] It is one of the most interesting buildings of the Triana neighborhood.[3] Usage[edit] The social and economic changes in the years that followed made it difficult for the heirs of Rodríguez Quegles to maintain the building, and it seemed inevitable that it would deteriorate and be ruined. The City Council of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria bought the building in 1972 to house the Higher Conservatory of Music[sp], and adapted it to this new use. After 16 years it could no longer accommodate the school's growing number of students, and the building was closed again.[1] In 1990 the City Council transferred it to the Canary Islands Ministry of Culture. Restoration revealed Venetian stucco, frescoes, tapestries and marbles, which had been hidden but were restored to their original state. The technicians restoring the exterior had to rely on the memories of the older neighbors to determine that it had been green.[1] On 12 September 1991 the General Directorate of Culture designated the palace as a historical-artistic monument, or Property of Cultural Interest.[6] The palace was occupied in turn by the Ministry of Education and Culture, the General Directorate of Universities and Research and the Canary Islands Academy of Language.[3] The palace today is used as an exhibition space and as a center for coordinating cultural activities in the city by the CreActiva project of the City Council.[7] As of 2020 it was the headquarters of the Las Palmas de Gran Canaria International Film Festival and the Philharmonic Society.[3] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Palacete Rodríguez Quegles.

The International Research and Exchanges Board’s (IREX) Media Sustainability Index (MSI) is a tool to evaluate the global development of independent media. The MSI is one of the most important indices "to assess how media systems change over time and across borders",[1] in addition to the Freedom of the Press Index compiled by Freedom House and the Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. In 2018, IREX launched a dynamic data platform, the Media Sustainability Explorer, that enables users to analyze and examine data from all years of the Europe and Eurasia MSI and to compare data trends across time, MSI objectives, regions and individual countries.

Middle East & North Africa were added first in 2005 and the Africa MSI was launched in 2007.[5] The MSI does not gauge Western Europe or the United States.[6] The surveys are funded by USAID, the US state department, UNESCO, Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the People Technology Foundation.[7] "Sustainability" within this concept "refers to the ability of media to play its vital role as the ‘fourth estate’".[8] In other words it relates to a media system that provides citizens with "useful, timely and objective information" [9] and as well to a media system that can operate free and independent without political, legal, social or economic restrictions.[10] Furthermore it refers to a media system in which Journalists have professional standards. And to a system where everybody has the right of free speech and access to information as the Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says. With the aid of the MSI an international comparison of the independence and/or sustainability of media systems is possible. An international comparison allows policymakers to parse media systems and examine the areas in which media development assistance can advance citizens’ access to news and information. Moreover, the results of the MSI provide essential information for the media, their representatives and outlets and inform them as well as the civil society and the governments of the strengths and weaknesses of each country.[11] Methodology[edit] Scoring system[edit] The MSI uses five fundamental objectives to assess to what extent a media system is independent, sustainable and successful. The five objectives are: "Legal and social norms protect and promote free speech and access to public information. Journalism meets professional standards of quality. Multiple news sources provide citizens with reliable, objective news. Media are well-managed enterprises, allowing editorial independence. Supporting institutions function in the professional interests of independent media".[12] These five objectives are the most central aspects of a sustainable and independent media system. Under each of these objectives are seven to nine indicators defining how well a country achieves that objective. Each indicator is scored from 0 to 4. A country scouring 0 does not fulfill the indicator and there might be forces holding back the implementation of the objective.[13] Score 1 signifies the country slightly reaches the characteristics of the indicator. That means the government or other forces do not actively combat its implementation, but business environment do not foster it and also government or profession do not entirely support the progress.[14] Score 2 implies that the country accomplishes many aspects of the indicator, but it is too early to evaluate the development. The country could still depend for example on present political forces.[15] Score 3 connotes that the country reaches most features of the indicator. Implementation of the indicator has appeared over a number of years and/or during changes in government. The score refers to likely sustainability.[16] Score 4 is the best score a panelist can give. It means the country fulfils all characteristics of the indicator. Implementation has endured intact over several changes in government and/or economy, shifts in public opinion and social conventions.[17] The scores for the indicators are then averaged to generate a single score for each objective. Next the five objectives’ scores are averaged to produce a final score for every country. In a following step the final score is interpreted as shown below: 0 - 1.00 = unsustainable, anti-free: Country does not reach or just slightly reaches objectives. Government and legislation actively holding back free media development. Country has little professionalism and low media-industry activity.[18] 1.01 - 2.00 = unsustainable mixed system: Country marginally approaches objectives. Country has parts of a legal system, government is against a free media system, but there is obvious improvement in free-press advocacy and increasing professionalism. To evaluate sustainability one must continue to observe the development of new media businesses.[19] 2.01 - 3.00 = near sustainability: Country approaches multiple objectives concerning legal norms, professionalism and a business environment supporting independent media. Improvements have survived shifts in government and have been established in law and practice. Nevertheless the country needs more time to guarantee that change and to maintain the increased professionalism and the still young media business environment.[20] 3.01 - 4.00 = sustainable: The media in the country is assumed to be professional, free and sustainable, or approaches these objectives almost. The systems fostering free media are still extant after several governments, after an unsteady economy and after changes in civic opinion or social conventions.[21] Scoring process[edit] In each country IREX compiles a panel of local experts who undertake the scoring. The recruited experts represent a broad range of local media workers (editors, reports, owners, managers, media development workers) of urban and rural populations, of the main local ethnic groups in addition to representatives from different geographic regions as well as representatives from academia, NGO’s and the legal field.[22][23][24] All panelists receive the objectives, the indicators with descriptions and an explanation of how the scoring is done correctly. First each panel member individually completes the questionnaire and scores the indicators. In a second step the panelists get together to talk about the objectives and indicators. This discussion is written up by a panel moderator, mostly a representative of the country’s media or an NGO. Then it is revised by IREX editorial staff. Panelists are allowed to change their scores during the discussion, but it is not promoted by IREX.[25][26] In a third step the "IREX editorial staff review the panelists’ scores, and then score the country independently of the MSI panel" . Comparing the MSI (IREX) to the Freedom of the Press Index (Freedom House)[edit] The following two tables show a synopsis of the Media Sustainability Index (MSI) and the Freedom of the Press Index compiled by Freedom House. Table 1 compares the basic characteristics of the two indices, whereas table 2 is a more detailed analysis of the questionnaires. Comparing the characteristics of the indices[edit] First of all you can see in table 1 that there are some similarities between the indices. Both IREX and Freedom House have their headquarters in America, both are nonprofit organizations, which receive financial support from the American government or from agencies like USAID or NED, which are subsidized on their part by the government.[27] Furthermore both indices measures are designed to evaluate characteristics of media systems from the point of view of elite evaluators. Means the survey in a certain country is conducted by experts of the media environment of the country concerned. But the two indices do not assess the same number of countries. The MSI rates 80 countries, whereas the Freedom of the Press Index rates more than twice as much countries. Another difference is that Freedom House captures all 196 countries in one annual report, which allows a comparison of all 196 countries at the same time, whereas IREX assesses the 80 countries in five studies (Africa, Asia, Europe & Eurasia and Middle East & North Africa), that are not published simultaneously and some of them not even annually. For example the last report of Middle East & North Africa one can download is from 2009.[28] This means it is not possible to compare the development of the media environment in the surveyed countries at the same time within one year. Another point is that Freedom House has measured Freedom of the Press since 1980, more than twenty years longer than IREX measures Media Sustainability. So it becomes evident that Freedom House has more experience in conducting these studies. Furthermore the two indices have different underlying concepts. The underlying concept of the Freedom of the Press Index is to evaluate the status of press freedom in an individual country.[29] IREX’s concept however is to assess how successful, independent, sustainable a media system is in an individual country and “how media systems change over time and across borders”.[30] To evaluate their respective target they use different questionnaires and scoring systems. The scoring systems as one can see in table 1 do not have much in common. IREX uses scores from 0 to 4, in which 0 is the worst score. Freedom House uses scores from 0 to 100, in which 0 is the best score. In advance Freedom House attaches different importance to the questions by giving some questions higher scores than others. So the panelists score the questions of the Freedom of the Press Index with a different number of points. The scoring system of the MSI is constantly the same. The surveyed persons score each indicator from 0 to 4. For this reason the MSI questionnaire seems to be clearer and more transparent and the questions can be better compared to each other.

Panelists score each indicator from 0-4.[42] 3 topics with 7-8 methodology questions (23 in total). Each methodology question has 3-8 sub-questions. Panelists score each methodology question, but not each sub-question. The sub-questions are meant to provide guidance for the meaning of the methodology question. Each methodology question is scored with a different number of points.[43] Comparing the questionnaires[edit] At first glance the questionnaires [44] appear to differ because of their different content and categories, their different structure and different number of questions, which you can see in table 1. But recent literature shows that there are similarities. For example Becker and Vlad found out that although the indices pretend to measure different concepts (sustainable media vs. press freedom) they have a high average correlation (*Pearson r .87) across the years 2001 to 2007.[45] This is so because press freedom is clearly a part of what the MSI assesses, because a media system cannot be sustainable without having a high level of press freedom. So press freedom is definitely one condition for a sustainable media system and therefore it becomes evident that the indices examine much the same phenomenon. It also explains why only about one-third of the questions could not be assigned in table 2 or why about two thirds of the questionnaires could be assigned. To find out what questions of the two indices really match and measure the same issues, the questionnaires need to be regarded in more detail. For that reason each single question of the two indices is compared to each other and assigned to new categories in table 2. Questions concerning the same subject but of two different indices are opposed to each other in two columns. If only one index measures a certain issue or category, the corresponding place in the second column remains empty, meaning this issue is not covered by the other index. As some questions contain different aspects, sometimes only one of the aspects fits to the associated question. To make this clear the non-fitting aspect is written in italics in table 2. Table 2 is based on the questionnaires of the MSI and the Freedom of the Press Index [46][47] Categories Media Sustainability Index (IREX) Freedom of the Press Index (Freedom House) Protection of free speech 1.1.

The MSI as well as the Freedom of the Press Index contain questions concerning the following categories: Protection of free speech The questions are about legal protection for free speech. But there are slight differences between the questions. For example the MSI includes social protection and a distinction between state and public media. The Freedom of the Press Index contains in addition or penalties of journalists and also the distinction between freedom of expression and freedom of the press. However, they both measure protection of free speech. Free access to media In this category the questions are all about free access to media and its protection. Here the MSI specifies the protection against economic threats and law restrictions. Whereas the Freedom of the Press Index just asks about it in general. The MSI also makes a distinction between local and international sources and only the Freedom of the Press Index differentiates between official and unofficial sources. Diversity of viewpoints The MSI has more than one question regarding this category because it specifies the viewpoints. Private and public news sources, niche reporting and programming, local, national and international information as well as social interests and minority languages should be reflected. This differentiation cannot be found in the Freedom of the Press Index. So Freedom House includes the access to plurality viewpoints, which is no subject within the MSI. Access to information Here the MSI differentiates between access to information for media, journalists and citizens, whereas the Index of Freedom House focuses more on existing laws protecting the access to information for journalists. Entry to media markets MSI compares the entry to the media market to entries to other industries. The Freedom of the Press Index operates in this category on a more specific and operational level. It includes both individuals and business entities, which can establish and operate media. And it also deals with the legal regulations for establishing media. Crimes against media workers The Freedom of the Press Index distinguishes between crimes committed by the state, authorities and other actors and the type of crimes such as legal intimidation, physical violence. It examines if local and foreign journalists can work freely without harassments. The MSI deals with legal prosecution of the crime but does not specify the type of crime nor who commits the crime. Both indices, however, differentiate against whom crimes are committed. Penalties for libeling The question about libeling asked by the Freedom of the Press Index concerns existing penalties for libeling officials or the state. The MSI relates more to the person who is defamed and what they can do to prevent libeling (e.g. public officials are held to higher standards, must prove falsity). Furthermore the MSI question contains the aspect of the civil law against libeling. Access to journalistic education Both indices ask if everyone has the freedom to become a professional journalist. But MSI also raises the question if there are restrictions against or special laws in favour of freedom. The Freedom of the Press Index instead contains the question if professional groups have the freedom to support journalists. This is just one example for the fact that the MSI as well as the Freedom of the Press Index sometimes ask two questions in one, which makes it difficult for the panelists to score. Self-censorship In this category the questions are relatively similar except that the MSI also queries the self-censorship of the editors. Another little difference is the fact that the MSI indicator is formulated negatively. Corruption Only the Freedom of the Press Index differentiates between private and public payments. Overall the question about corruption is put more directly in the Freedom of the Press Index than in the MSI. The MSI asks in one question if the payment of journalists is high enough and if the quality standard of the journalists is good enough to prevent corruption. Put that way, the question concerning corruption seems less direct and aggressive in the MSI index. Transparency of media ownership and of media concentration Both indices ask if media ownership and concentration allows transparency so that consumers are able to judge the content and have access to different points of view. In the Freedom of the Press Index the question to what extent the government controls the media and what impact control has on the diversity of views is put in a way that public broadcasting is subliminally criticized. IREX, however, words the question in a more positive way. The way of putting a question, the choice of words may have an influence on the valuation. Subvention system Again the question of the Freedom of the Press Index is asked more directly than the MSI one. It focuses on the control-aspect someone (state or other actors) can have through subsidies or advertising. By contrast the MSI indicator deals more with a fair and law-based distribution of subsidies and advertising that promotes editorial independence. But the MSI question does not refer to subsidies and advertising from other actors than the government. External media bodies and evaluations Here all questions are put positively. But they contain different external media bodies. Whereas the MSI indicators include independent broadcasting ratings and market researches and its duties, the question of the Freedom of the Press Index includes independent media regulatory bodies like the communications council. Distribution and production restrictions The MSI questions in this category are more detailed. They divide production and distribution in their different branches like media equipment, newsprint, and printing facilities, kiosks, transmitters, cable, Internet, mobile. And again the questions are devised positively with words like apolitical or not restricted. In contrast the Freedom of the Press Index does not divide production and distribution in different branches and here again the question is asked in a direct way in order to get an exact answer to what it wants to measure: the restrictions. Political parallelism These questions examine to what extent the state, politicians or others affect or influence the media content and diversity. Again the MSI question is put in a more positive way due to the use of positive adjectives, whereas the Freedom of the Press Index uses negatively connoted verbs like determine. Generally speaking, the Freedom of the Press Index operates with more direct questions and on a more restrictive level. The questions mostly refer to possible media restrictions, influences or control by someone or something. As already indicated by its name, this way of asking questions shows the Freedom of the Press Index’s main concern and underlying concept - that is the freedom of the press. This concept of the freedom of the press must be seen together with "the legal environment for the media, political pressures that influence reporting, and economic factors that affect access to information".[48] So the Freedom of the Press Index also includes for example questions about independent judiciary, censorship and the impact of the overall economic stability on the media, subjects that are not covered by the MSI. The MSI, however, operates on a wider field. That means it also focuses on professional standards, quality journalism, trainees for journalists, modern technical facilities for distributing and infrastructure, NGOs supporting free media, and the existence of private media as one can see in table 2. But one should keep in mind that both indices have an American bias underlying their measures and concepts. Therefore the indices may not fit perfectly in order to access media freedom in countries with a different cultural background.

McGee (1923 - March 19, 1945) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II. Contents 1 Biography 2 Medal of Honor citation 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Biography[edit] McGee joined the Army from his birth city of Indianapolis, Indiana in 1943,[1] and by March 18, 1945 was serving as a private in the Medical Detachment of the 304th Infantry Regiment, 76th Infantry Division. On that day, near Mülheim, Germany, he voluntarily walked into a minefield to aid two comrades who had been wounded by anti-personnel mines. After carrying one man to safety, he returned to rescue the second man but stepped on a mine and was himself seriously wounded. He ordered his fellow soldiers to stay out of the minefield and not risk their safety by trying to rescue him; McGee died of his injuries the next day. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor a year later, on February 26, 1946. McGee was buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery in the city of Luxembourg. His grave can be found in plot C-7-13. Medal of Honor citation[edit] Private McGee's official Medal of Honor citation reads: A medical aid man, he made a night crossing of the Moselle River with troops endeavoring to capture the town of Mulheim. The enemy had retreated in the sector where the assault boats landed, but had left the shore heavily strewn with antipersonnel mines. Two men of the first wave attempting to work their way forward detonated mines which wounded them seriously, leaving them bleeding and in great pain beyond the reach of their comrades. Entirely on his own initiative, Pvt. McGee entered the minefield, brought out 1 of the injured to comparative safety, and had returned to rescue the second victim when he stepped on a mine and was severely wounded in the resulting explosion. Although suffering intensely and bleeding profusely, he shouted orders that none of his comrades was to risk his life by entering the death-sown field to render first aid that might have saved his life. In making the supreme sacrifice, Pvt. demonstrated a concern for the well-being of his fellow soldiers that transcended all considerations for his own safety and a gallantry in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.

Over a four-year period, Bowen took about £170,000 in goods and coinage and retired to Bourbon for a brief period of time before his death in 1704. Contents 1 Early life 2 Piratical career 2.1 Captain of the Speaker 2.2 As captain of the Speedy Return 3 Return to Rajapura, retirement and death 4 References 5 External links Early life[edit] Born on Bermuda, Bowen later moved to the proprietary colony of Carolina, where he signed on an English ship, serving as a petty officer.[4] However, Bowen's ship was attacked and he was captured by French pirates. The pirates crossed the Atlantic Ocean, heading to Madagascar, but they ran aground near Elesa on the south of the island. Bowen and the other English prisoners managed to seize the ship's longboat, They sailed the 15 leagues (45 miles) to St. Augustine. Bowen remained at St. Augustine for the next 18 months before finally deciding to become a pirate himself. He joined the crew of Captain Read, being elected sailing master by the crew. Following Read's capture of a large Indian ship, Bowen returned to Madagascar and joined George Booth as a crewman. In April 1699, Booth captured a 450-ton, 50-gun former slave ship, the Speaker. Bowen served under Booth's command until 1700, when Booth was killed by Arabs at Zanzibar when negotiating for the resupplying of his ship. Piratical career[edit] Captain of the Speaker[edit] Bowen was initially successful. He attacked a 13-strong fleet of Moorish ships and, though some of them escaped in darkness, captured a prize with an estimated value of £100,000.[5][6] Following this, Bowen attacked a number of ships, including an English East Indiaman commanded by Captain Conway in November 1701, off the coast of Malabar. Despite these attacks, Bowen was able to continue to trade in local ports - following his attack on the East Indiaman, Bowen openly towed her into the nearby port of Callicoon and sold her in three shares to local merchants. The Speaker was lost in late 1701 when, during a voyage to Madagascar, she ran aground St. Thomas' Reef off Mauritius.[7] However, Bowen and most of the crew were able to reach the shore. After three months on the island, they were able to purchase a sloop and, after converting it into a brigantine (later renamed as the Content) he and his crew left and, upon arriving at Madagascar founded a town and at fort Maratan. As captain of the Speedy Return[edit] In early 1702, Bowen and a number of pirates seized the Speedy Return, commanded by Captain Drummond, as well as the aged Brigantine Content (some sources say Continent), both owned by the Company of Scotland, which Drummond had planned to fill with slaves from Île Sainte-Marie to sale to Portuguese cocoa plantation owners in Africa. The brigantine was found to be useless for piracy and was burned. The Speedy Return was refitted to use against commercial vessels. The Speedy Return and the Content left Maratan together, but on the first night of the voyage, the Content ran aground on a ledge. Unaware of this, Bowen continued to sail for the Mascarene Islands. He expected to find the Rook Galley, as the ship had been sighted there earlier by former members of Drummond's crew. However, the Rook Galley was gone and Bowen decided to sail to Mauritius to look for her. Still unable to find the vessel, Bowen did not attack the ships in the harbour, since he did not know their strength. Instead, he sailed to Augustin Bay, where he met the Content. However, when the Content was examined, he found it to be useless to him and had the vessel burned. The crew came aboard the Speedy Return. In late 1702 Bowen once again met Thomas Howard, who, after leaving Bowen's crew at Madagascar following the loss of the Speaker had, along with a group of pirates, taken the 36-gun Prosperous, at the port of Mayotta. By Christmas, Bowen and Howard decided to join their forces. In March 1703 Bowen had the Speedy Return careened and it was not until the August 1703 that together they attacked and plundered the East Indiaman Pembroke near Johanna Island, one of the Comoros Islands. Bowen and Howard then attacked two Indian ships in the Red Sea, capturing the larger and renaming her Defiant. Return to Rajapura, retirement and death[edit] After declaring the Speedy Return and Prosperous unsound, they were burned and Bowen took command of the Defiant. Having also taken a sum of £70,000, Bowen returned to the port of Rajapura where the plunder was divided, and Thomas Howard remained, and then on to the Mascarene Islands where he and 40 others left the Defiant, with his intention being to retire from piracy and to return to Madagascar. However, within six months Bowen died of an unspecified intestinal disease and was buried on Bourbon. Following his retirement, Nathaniel North was elected to replace him as Captain of the Defiant. Bowen's career as a pirate was later profiled by Captain Charles Johnson - commonly believed to be a pseudonym of Daniel Defoe - in A General History of the Pyrates.[8] References[edit] General Seitz, Don Carlos, Howard F.

The number of species that exhibit small body size generally far exceed the number of species that are large-bodied. Macroecology has long sought to understand the mechanisms that underlie the patterns of biodiversity, such as the body size-species richness pattern. This pattern was first observed by Hutchinson and MacArthur (1959),[1] and it appears to apply equally well to a broad range of taxa: from birds and mammals to insects, bacteria (May, 1978;[2] Brown and Nicoletto, 1991[3]) and deep sea gastropods (McClain, 2004[4]). Nonetheless, its ubiquity remains undecided. Most studies focus on the distribution of taxonomic fractions of largely non-interacting species such as birds or mammals; this article is primarily based on those data. Figure 1. The Frequency distribution of North American land mammals (n=465). The figure shows a right skewed distribution, with a mode tending to smaller species (50–100 g). The x-axis encompasses mammals ranging in size from 3 grams to 393 kilograms.

Traditionally the pattern has been explored by plotting the number of species on the y-axis and the logarithm to the base two of the species body mass (g) on the x-axis. This yields a highly right skewed body size distribution with a mode centered near species with a mass ranging from 50-100 grams. Although this relationship is very distinct at large spatial scales, the pattern breaks down when the sampling area is small (Hutchinson and MacArthur, 1959;[1] Brown and Maurer 1989;[5] Brown and Nicoletto 1991;[3] Bakker and Kelt 2000[6]). Scale dependence of the pattern[edit] At small spatial scales (e.g. a dozen hectares or a local community) the body size-species richness pattern dissolves and the number of species per body size class is almost uniform (i.e. there is an equal number of small and large bodied species in the community (see fig. 2 b)). Researchers have documented this transition by sampling species at different spatial scales; at intermediate spatial scales (e.g. a thousand hectares or a biome) the body size-species richness distribution begins to shift from being right skewed (from fewer large-bodied species) towards a normal distribution. Finally, when macroecologists compare the body size-species richness distributions of continents to those of communities the distributions are significantly different (Hutchinson and MacArthur, 1959;[1] Brown and Maurer, 1989;[5] Brown and Nicoletto, 1991;[3] Bakker and Kelt, 2000[6]) (see fig. 1 vs. fig. 2 b)). Figure 2. a) Figure 2. b) Figure 2. The Frequency distribution of land mammals at two different spatial scales. The figure shows a shift from a slightly right skewed distribution at the biome scale (a) to a normal distribution at the community level (b). The x-axis ranges from 0 to 20 on a log-scale in both graphs. Redrawn from Brown and Nicoletto (1991).[3] Counter examples[edit] Not all geographic subsets of taxonomic groups follow this broad pattern, in contrast, Northwest European land snails exhibit a normal distribution (Hausdorf, 2006[8]). Additionally, the terrestrial mammals of the islands of Madagascar, New Guinea and Australia do not show a right skewed body size-species richness distribution (Maurer et al. 1992[7]). Given the limited amount of non-conforming data it is not possible to determine if this phenomenon is universal or is simply novel in certain environments. Underreporting of taxonomic and geographic subsets that do not conform to this pattern may be partially responsible for this unresolve. Possible mechanisms[edit] If it were possible to randomly sample a subset of the known continental species pool for mammals, one would expect the body size-species richness distribution of this sample to roughly mirror that of the entire continent. Since it does not, and if it is assumed that the observed distribution of species among body sizes is not a sampling bias, then some ecological interactions must underlie this pattern. Explanations in the literature suggest the rates of speciation and/or dispersal ability vary with size and could lead to more small bodied organisms (May, 1978[2]). Additionally, extinction risk, competition and energetic restraints have also been proposed as critical mechanisms that may drive this pattern (Brown and Maurer, 1989;[5] Brown and Nicoletto, 1991[3]). Finally, the metabolic theory of ecology explains how there is a negative relationship between number of individuals (N) and size (M) ( N = M − 3 / 4 {\displaystyle N=M^{-3/4}} ), but it is silent on species richness. Remember, while there are fewer individuals in the largest size classes, energy availability is equal across all classes of interacting organisms (i.e. they share the same energy pool and are thus part of the same ecosystem) (energetic equivalence) (May, 1988[9]). It is important to note that the 3 sub-mechanisms: dispersal, competition and energetic restraints must in some manner feed back into either speciation or extinction rates as these are the only ultimate processes (see Tinbergen's four questions) governing the number of species on earth and hence the body size-species richness pattern. Speciation rates[edit] Small organisms generally have shorter generation times and are quick to mature and reproduce (May, 1978;[2] Denney et al. 2002;[10] Savage et al. 2004[11]). These traits may promote speciation through increased mutation and selection events as molecular evolution scales with metabolic rate (Gillooly et al. 2005[12]) and thus with body size. For example, bacteria can evolve a degree of antibiotic resistance in a very short time period. This evolution is facilitated by a short generation time and presumably would not be possible for species with slower life histories. Thus, one can think of it as if the "evolutionary clock ticks faster" (May, 1978[2]) for small organisms. If this were true then a simple explanation of why there are more small species on earth would be because they speciate faster. However, a recent analysis by Cardillo and colleagues (2003)[13] revealed that body size did not influence the speciation rates of Australia's mammals. Similarly, a study using birds failed to demonstrate that body size and speciation rates were negatively correlated (Nee et al. 1992[14]). Differential extinction rates[edit] It is known that extinction risk is directly correlated to the size of a species population. Small populations tend to go extinct more frequently than large ones (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967[15]). As large species require more daily resources they are forced to have low population densities, thereby lowering the size of the population in a given area and allowing each individual to have access to enough resources to survive. In order to increase the population size and avoid extinction, large organisms are constrained to have large ranges (see Range (biology)). Thus, the extinction of large species with small ranges becomes inevitable (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967;[15] Brown and Maurer, 1989;[5] Brown and Nicoletto, 1991[3]). This results in the amount of space limiting the overall number of large animals that can be present on a continent, while range size (and risk of extinction) prevents large animals from inhabiting only a small area. These constraints undoubtedly have implications for the species richness patterns for both large and small-bodied organisms, however the specifics have yet to be elucidated. Dispersal rate[edit] Understanding dispersal is an important mechanism that may underlie the body size-species richness pattern. Mainly, dispersal ability can affect speciation rates in various ways: if an organism is capable of dispersing across great distances which span variable habitat, it will be more likely that individuals that settle in these new areas will be subject to different selection regimes, leading to new species through natural selection. Alternatively, great dispersal ability can act against the efforts of natural selection by facilitating geneflow. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability may in fact have lower speciation rates. Then again, if a species disperses long distances and has a large range, it may also be more likely to have its range bisected by natural barriers which could promote allopatric speciation over evolutionary time. Researchers have shown that body size and dispersal ability do not correlate (Jenkins et al. 2007[16]). However, this finding rests heavily on the fact that active and passive dispersers have been grouped together in the analyses. When the same data are separated into two categories (active and passive dispersers) a pattern emerges. Jenkins and others (2007[16]) have found that for active dispersers larger organisms will disperse greater distances. Regardless of this correlation its effects on speciation rates remain unclear. Interspecific competition[edit] Could similar sized species be mitigating the effects of competition by avoiding each other? Interspecific competition is in fact strong among species that are the same size (Bowers and Brown, 1982[17]). Researchers have proposed that in order to lessen the burden of competition among animals within the same guild (see Guild (ecology)), they must vary in size (Brown and Maurer, 1989;[5] Brown and Nicoletto, 1991[3]). For example, Bowers and Brown (1982)[17] found that the number of similar sized species in a community of granivorous rodents was fewer than expected. They believe that these results suggest that competition between same-sized species is prohibiting co-existence in this community. Energetic constraints[edit] A small bodied animal has a greater capacity to be more abundant than a large bodied one. Purely as a function of geometry many more small things can be packed into a given space than can large things into the same area. However, these limits are generally never reached in ecological systems as other resources become limiting long before the packing limits are reached. Additionally, smaller species may have many more ecological niches available to them and thus facilitating the diversification of life (Hutchinson and MacArthur, 1959[1]). Larger organisms require more food overall (Blackburn and Gaston, 1997[18]), however they require less energy per unit of body mass. As a result, larger species are able to survive on a lower quality diet than smaller species. For example, grazing animals make up for their poor quality diet by digesting food longer and are able to extract more energy from it (Maurer et al. 1992[7]). Smaller species tend to specialize in a habitat that can provide them with a high quality diet. Habitat quality is highly variable and as a result smaller species tend to be present in less of their range. Instead, they are only found in patches of their range where there is good habitat. A correlate to this argument is that the opposite is true for larger species. Larger species have lower beta diversity and are replaced less frequently across landscapes and as a result tend to occupy more of their range (see Occupancy-abundance relationship relationships) (Brown and Maurer, 1989;[5] Brown and Nicoletto, 1991[3]). This mechanism likely contributes to the shift in body size-species richness distribution observed between continental and local scales. Recently, the metabolic theory of ecology has been used to explain macroecological patterns. According to May (1978[9]) there is equal energy flow through all size classes of interacting organisms. This has implications for the number of individuals in each size class and potentially the number of species as well. May (1978[2]) was the first to describe a mathematical equation that could be used to explain the right hand side of the body size-species richness pattern . His equation states that the number of species (S) is proportional to the length (L) of the species raised to the exponent of negative two ( S = L − 2 {\displaystyle S=L^{-2}} ). This theory is based on data from many different terrestrial animals (mammals, birds, beetles, and butterflies) and has garnered further support from a more recent study by Rice and Gislason (1996).[19] These new results also demonstrate a slope of negative two with respect to the right side of the body size-species richness pattern in the fish assemblage of the North Sea. Whether a slope of -2 is universal and what the mechanisms are that underlie this theory remain unclear. Figure 3. The Frequency distribution of North American land mammals (n=465).

Worcester County is usually considered to be in central Massachusetts (light green), although western parts of Worcester County are sometimes considered Western Massachusetts. Western Massachusetts is a region in Massachusetts, one of the six U.S. states that make up the New England region of the United States. Western Massachusetts has diverse topography; 22 colleges and universities, with approximately 100,000 students;[1][dead link] and such institutions as Tanglewood, the Springfield Armory, and Jacob's Pillow. The western part of Western Massachusetts includes the Berkshire Mountains, where there are several vacation resorts. The eastern part of the region includes the Connecticut River Valley, which has a number of university towns, the major city Springfield, and numerous agricultural hamlets.[2] In the eastern part of the area, the Quabbin region is a place of outdoor recreation.[3] Contents 1 History 1.1 Native inhabitants 1.2 Colonial and early Federal period 2 Geography 2.1 Berkshire Mountains 2.2 Connecticut River Valley 2.3 The Hilltowns 2.4 The Quabbin and Quaboag Regions 2.5 Geology 3 Demographics 4 Economy 5 Education 5.1 Colleges and universities 6 Government and politics 6.1 Counties 6.2 Attitude towards Eastern Massachusetts/Boston 7 Transportation 7.1 Interstates 7.2 U.S. Routes 7.3 State highways 7.4 Bridges and tunnels 7.5 Airports 7.5.1 Nearby airports in other states 7.6 Rail and bus 8 Leisure activities and places of historical interest 8.1 Outdoor recreation 9 See also 10 Citations 11 General references 12 External links History[edit] Native inhabitants[edit] Archeological efforts in the Connecticut River Valley have revealed traces of human life dating back at least 9,000 years. Pocumtuck tradition describes the creation of Lake Hitchcock in Deerfield by a giant beaver, possibly representing the action of a glacier that retracted at least 12,000 years ago. Western Massachusetts was originally settled by Native American societies, including the Pocomtuc, Nonotuck Mohawk, Nipmuck, and Mahican. Various sites indicate millennia of fishing, horticulture, beaver-hunting, and burials. The passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990 ordered museums across Western Mass and the country to repatriate these remains to Native peoples, an ongoing process. The region was inhabited by several Algonkian-speaking Native American communities, culturally connected but distinguished by the place names they assigned to their respective communities: Agawam (low land), Woronco (in a circular way), Nonotuck (in the midst of the river), Pocumtuck (narrow, swift river), and Sokoki (separated from their neighbors). The modern-day Springfield metropolitan area was inhabited by the Agawam people.[4] The Agawam, as well as other groups, belong to the larger cultural category of Alongkian Indians. In 1634, a plague, probably smallpox, reduced the Native American population of the Connecticut River Valley to a tiny percentage of its previous size. Governor Bradford of Massachusetts writes that in Windsor, notably the site of a trading post, where European diseases often spread to Native populations, "of 1,000 of [the Indians] 150 of them died." With so many dead, British colonists were emboldened to attempt significant settlement of the region.[5] Colonial and early Federal period[edit] The first European explorers to reach Western Massachusetts were English Puritans, who in 1635, at the request of William Pynchon, settled the land that they considered most advantageous for both agriculture and trading - in modern Agawam, adjacent to modern Metro Center, Springfield. In 1636, a group of English settlers—lured by the promise of a "great river" and the northeast's most fertile farmland—ventured to Springfield, where they established a permanent colony. Originally, this settlement was called Agawam Plantation, and administered by the Connecticut Colony. (Springfield lies only 4 miles north of Connecticut; however, Agawam included lands as far south as Windsor Locks, as far north as Holyoke, and as far west as Westfield.[6]) In 1640, Springfield voted to separate from the Connecticut Colony following a series of contentious incidents, and after a brief period of independence, decided to align with the coastal Massachusetts Bay Colony, shaping the region's political boundaries. The Massachusetts Bay Colony settled at the Connecticut River Valley's most fertile land - stretching from Windsor, Connecticut, (once part of Springfield,) to Northampton, Massachusetts - from 1636 to 1654. For the next several decades, Native people experienced a complex relationship with European settlers. The fur trade stood at the heart of their economic interactions, a lucrative business that guided many other policy decisions. White settlers traded wampum, cloth and metal in exchange for furs, as well as horticultural produce. Because of the seasonal nature of goods provided by Native people, compared with the constant availability of English ones, a credit system developed. Land, the natural resource whose availability did not fluctuate, served as collateral for mortgages in which Native people bought English goods in exchange for the future promise of beavers. However, trade with the English made pelts so lucrative that the beaver was rapidly overhunted. The volume of the trade fell, from a 1654 high of 3723 pelts to a mere 191 ten years later. With every mortgage, Native people lost more land, although their population recovered and expanded from the old plague.[7] In a process that Lisa Brooks calls “the deed game,” [8] the English took more land from Native people through debt, alcohol, and other methods. Native people began to construct and gather in palisaded “forts” - structures that were not necessary beforehand. These sites were excavated in the 19th and 20th centuries by anthropologists who took cultural objects and human remains and displayed them for years in area museums. With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, a long process of repatriation began. Some individuals became deeply enmeshed in colonial life, even becoming employed by white households. However, there was a simultaneous effort by the English to enforce social division, including bans on interracial marriage, English habitation among Indians, and Native presence in English towns during nighttime hours. In 1662, the leader of the Eastern Massachusetts Wampanoag Indian tribe, Wamsutta, died shortly after being questioned at gunpoint by Plymouth colonists. This came after years of English settlers encroaching upon Native land and decimating the native population with European diseases. Wamsutta's brother, Chief Metacomet (known to inhabitants of Springfield as "Philip,") began a struggle against the English known as "King Philip's War" which spread across the region. As the conflict grew in its initial months, the English in Western Massachusetts were deeply concerned with maintaining the loyalty of “their Indians.”[9] The Agawams cooperated, even providing valuable intelligence to the English. In August 1675, English soldiers in Hadley demanded the disarming of a “fort” of Nonotuck Indians. Unwilling to relinquish their weapons, they left on the night of August 25. A hundred English soldiers pursued them, catching up to them at the foot of Sugarloaf Hill, which was a sacred space for the Nonotucks called the Great Beaver. The English attacked, but the Nonotucks forced them to withdraw and were able to keep moving.[10] The shedding of Native blood on sacred land was an attack on their entire kinship network, and caused Native peoples in Western Massachusetts to join the war. Following the war, the greater part of the Native American population left Western Massachusetts behind.[11] Many refugees of the war joined the Wabanaki in the north, where their descendants remain today. Native American influence remains evident in the land and culture of Western Massachusetts, from the practice of tobacco farming to the names of cities and rivers[12] In 1777, George Washington and Henry Knox selected Springfield for the site of the fledgling United States' National Armory. Built atop a high bluff overlooking the Connecticut River, Washington and Knox agreed that Springfield provided an ideal location—beside a great river and at the confluence of major rivers and highways. For the following 200 years, the Springfield Armory would bring concentrated prosperity and innovation to Springfield and its surrounding towns. After the American Revolution, a rebellion led by Daniel Shays culminated in a battle at the National Armory in Springfield. Geography[edit] Berkshire Mountains[edit] The Berkshires have long been patronized by artists (e.g. Herman Melville, who wrote Moby-Dick while living in Pittsfield; Edith Wharton, who wrote The House of Mirth and Ethan Frome while living in Lenox; and Norman Rockwell, many of whose painting were based on scenes that he observed in the town of Stockbridge. Cultural institutions include Lenox's Tanglewood, Becket's Jacob's Pillow, and Stockbridge's Norman Rockwell Museum, as well the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown. The city of Pittsfield is the largest community located in the Berkshires. Connecticut River Valley[edit] New England's largest river, the Connecticut, flows through the center of its agricultural valley. Nearly bisected by the American east coast's only east-west mountain ranges (the Holyoke Range and the Mount Tom Range), this relatively small area contains a number of college towns, urban environments, and rural hamlets. The portion of this valley in Massachusetts is also commonly referred to as the Pioneer Valley. At its southern tip, the Springfield-Hartford region is home to 29 colleges and universities and over 160,000 university students—the United States' second highest concentration of higher learning institutions after the Boston metropolitan area.[13][better source needed] Innovations originating in the valley include the sports of basketball (James Naismith, 1895) and volleyball (William Morgan, 1895); the first American automobile (Duryea, 1893); the first motorcycle company (Indian, 1901); the first use of interchangeable parts in manufacturing (Thomas Blanchard, 1825); and the first commercial radio station, (WBZ, 1920, from Springfield's Kimball Hotel). Significant Massachusetts towns and cities in the valley's so-called "Knowledge Corridor" include Northampton, Amherst, Easthampton, Holyoke, Chicopee, West Springfield, East Longmeadow, Longmeadow, Ludlow, Agawam, and Westfield. The Hilltowns[edit] The Hilltowns include the areas of Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden Counties west of and above the escarpment bordering the ancient rift valley through which the Connecticut River flows. Elevations increase from about 200 feet (60 meters) to at least 1,000 feet in the escarpment zone. On top, elevations rise gradually to the west. Williamsburg in Hampshire County and Becket in Berkshire County are prominent Hilltowns. Generally, the Hilltowns west of the Connecticut River Valley were less attractive for agricultural uses, which resulted in later migration there than, for example, the fertile Connecticut River Valley. Subsistence farming predominated in this area. The 1,000 foot (300 meter) elevation difference between uplands and the Connecticut River Valley produced streams and rivers with gradients around 40′/mile (8 meters/km) flowing through steep-sided valleys, notably the Westfield and Deerfield Rivers and their larger tributaries. Mills were built to exploit the kinetic energy of falling water and mill towns grew up around them, or company towns integrating production, residential and commercial activities. The development of steam engines to free industrialization from reliance on water power brought about the so-called Second Industrial Revolution when railroads were built along the rivers to take advantage of relatively gentle grades over the Appalachians. And so as hilltop farming towns declined in importance, industrial towns in the river valleys rose to local prominence. The Quabbin and Quaboag Regions[edit] In northern Massachusetts, the higher altitude area to the east of the Connecticut River Valley is known as the North Quabbin region. These northern municipalities include Warwick, Orange, Petersham, Phillipston, Wendell, New Salem, and Athol near the New Hampshire border. The South Quabbin region (formerly the Swift River Valley) includes the towns of Barre, Belchertown, Pelham, Ware, Hardwick, Leverett, and Shutesbury. This area once included the four "Lost Towns" of Enfield, Dana, Greenwich, and Prescott, which were destroyed to make way for the Quabbin Reservoir. Farther south, the area called the Quaboag Hills includes Hampden, Monson, Wales, Warren, Holland, and Wilbraham on the Connecticut border. Numerous other towns stretching east towards Worcester are sometimes included in the Quaboag Valley region. Geology is similar to the Hilltown-Berkshire uplands with resistant metamorphic rocks overlain by thin and rocky soil. With less relief, the river valleys are less pronounced, but still moderately high gradient. The Quaboag Hills and Valley, the Quabbin Regions, and populated places stretching east towards Worcester are all locally known as "Hill Towns"; a term interchangeable with the Hill Towns west of the Pioneer Valley. Geology[edit] The mountain range in Berkshire County at the western end of Massachusetts is conventionally known as the "Berkshires". Geologically, however, the Berkshires are a westward continuation of uplands west of the Connecticut River and a southern extension of Vermont's Green Mountains. The Hilltown-Berkshire upland ends at the valley of the Housatonic River which flows south to Long Island Sound, and in the extreme north west of Massachusetts at the Hoosic River, a tributary of the Hudson. From these valleys, uplands to the east appear as a rounded mountain range, rising some 1,600 feet (500 meters) although they are actually a plateau. West of the Housatonic-Hoosic valley system rises the narrower Taconic Range along the New York border. Upper tributaries of the Hoosic separate Massachusetts' highest peak, Mount Greylock 3,491′ (1,064 meters) from both ranges, however Greylock's geology connects it with the Taconics. Most of this region is a rolling upland of schist, gneiss and other resistant metamorphics with intrusions of pegmatite and granite. Scraping by continental glaciers during the Pleistocene left thin, rocky soil that supported hardscrabble subsistence farming before the Industrial Revolution. There was hardly a land rush into such marginal land, but the uplands were slowly settled by farmers throughout most of the 18th century and organized into townships. Then in the early 1800s better land opened up in Western New York and the Northwest Territory. The hilltown agricultural population went into a long decline and fields began reverting to forest. The Connecticut River Valley is an ancient downfaulted graben or rift valley that formed during the Mesozoic Era when rifting developed in the Pangaea supercontinent to separate North America from Europe and South America from Africa. Secondary rifts branched off the main crustal fracture, and this one was eventually occupied by the Connecticut River. The Metacomet Ridge is a series of narrow traprock ridges where lava penetrated this rift zone, beginning at the northern end of the graben near Greenfield and extending south across Massachusetts and Connecticut to Long Island Sound. Fossil dinosaur footprints in Holyoke attest to the life present in this region during the Mesozoic. As continental glaciers receded near the end of the last glacial period, a moraine at Rocky Hill, Connecticut dammed the river to create Lake Hitchcock, extending northward some 200 miles (320 km) inundating places such as Springfield, Agawam, and West Springfield, while certain highlands remained above water, (i.e. sections of Holyoke). Accumulation of fine sediments during the era of Lake Hitchcock accounts for this region's exceptionally rich agricultural soil, which attracted settlers as early as 1635. Although the Connecticut River Valley's soil is the richest in New England, many of its fields have been covered by urban and suburban development. Regardless, the valley remains New England's most productive farmland. Tobacco, tomatoes, sweet corn, and other vegetables are still produced there in commercial quantities. Demographics[edit] Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire and Hampden counties, in the year 2000 collectively had 814,967 residents, a population greater than that of any one of the six smallest U.S. states. The population amounted to approximately 12.84% of the 2000 population of the entire state of Massachusetts, which was 6,349,097.[14] Its average population density is 293.07 inhabitants per square mile (113.16/km2), compared to 422.34/km2 (1,093.87/sq mi) for the rest of Massachusetts, and 312.68/km2 (809.83/sq mi) for the state as a whole. Western Massachusetts' population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs along the Connecticut River in an urban axis surrounding Springfield that is contiguous with greater Hartford, Connecticut (i.e. the Knowledge Corridor.) A secondary population concentration exists in the Housatonic-Hoosic valley due to the industrial heritage of Pittsfield and North Adams, and the development of tourism throughout that valley. This far-western zone is linked to New York City and Albany, New York more than with the rest of Massachusetts, however both populated zones are ultimately part of the Northeast megalopolis. The rest of Western Massachusetts is lightly populated, particularly the Hilltowns where densities below 50 persons per square mile (20 per km2) are the rule. In descending order of size, its largest communities are: Springfield, Chicopee, Pittsfield, Westfield, Holyoke, Northampton, Agawam, West Springfield, Amherst Center (CDP), Easthampton, Longmeadow (CDP), East Longmeadow, North Adams, and Greenfield (CDP). Economy[edit] Western Massachusetts has been compared as a microcosm of the rest of the United States.[15] The third largest city in Massachusetts, Springfield is situated in the region, and it has struggle financially coming close to bankruptcy at the beginning of the 21st century.[16] The unemployment rate in the area lags behind that of Eastern Massachusetts by double[17][18] though officials have pushed for ways to lure more longer term business growth into the region to tap the abundance of students being turned out by colleges and universities in the area.[19] To combat the higher cost of telecommunications which were roughly double that of Eastern Massachusetts, the government of the Commonwealth invested $45.4 Million in building out a broadband network using Federal grant under the 'Massachusetts Technology Park - MassBroadband 123' initiative,[20] funds which were matched by $45 million in federal investment.[21] The 1,200 mile 'middle mile' project was completed in early 2014,[22] connecting public institutions throughout central and western Massachusetts, but also providing a fiber-optic backbone to allow for further expansion in these regions. Building off of that project, the Commonwealth launched a 'Last Mile' initiative targeting 54 communities that were unserved or under-served by broadband. That program has invested in municipal fiber-to-the-home networks,[23] which are also supported by municipal bonds; private provider projects;[24] and advanced wireless projects[25] to connect homes and businesses in these communities. Small, rural towns such as Mount Washington, Mass., now have access to internet speeds that reach 500 megabit per second (Mbps) symmetrical service.[26] In recent years there has been a push for adding high-speed rail from Western Massachusetts for Eastern Massachusetts.[27][28] The residents of Western Massachusetts have vibrant culture in and support the local mix of arts, tourism, and culture.[29] Education[edit] The decline of manufacturing as the region's economic engine since World War II—and in particular, since the controversial closing of the Springfield Armory—was counterbalanced in Western Massachusetts by growth in post-secondary education and healthcare. This created new jobs, land development, and had gentrifying effects in many college towns. State and community-funded schools (e.g., University of Massachusetts Amherst and Westfield State University) were conspicuous in their growth, as were the region's highly regarded liberal arts colleges, including Williams founded 1793, Amherst founded 1821, Mount Holyoke founded 1837, Smith founded 1871, and American International founded 1885. Despite the gains in higher ed, the region has sought to obtain equitable share of the state's education budget to place into local primary education as well. Several communities in Western Mass have fought to have changes made the Chapter 70 structure which the state presently uses to allocate education funding to cities and towns.[30] Colleges and universities[edit] Amherst College American International College Bard College at Simon's Rock Bay Path University Berkshire Community College Cambridge College Conway School of Landscape Design Elms College Five Colleges Association Greenfield Community College Hallmark Institute of Photography Hampshire College Holyoke Community College Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts Mount Holyoke College Smith College Springfield College Springfield Technical Community College University of Massachusetts Amherst Westfield State University Western New England University Williams College Government and politics[edit] Western Massachusetts used to be the Republican stronghold in an otherwise heavily Democratic state, but it is now consistently viewed by political analysts as one of the most politically liberal regions in the United States. In 2006 and 2010, the region voted heavily in favor of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Deval Patrick. In Crash!ng the Party, Ralph Nader includes Western Massachusetts as one of the few places in the country where he believes small-town spirit is still strong. In a 2010 editorial, the Boston Globe berated communities in northern Western Massachusetts for resisting efforts to force consolidation of local school districts.[31] In response, the Franklin County School Committee Caucus released a map that overlaid the county north-to-south over Metro Boston. The overlay reached from Rhode Island in the south to New Hampshire in the north and Framingham in the west. In 2008 the Office of the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts opened a local office in Western Massachusetts. Counties[edit] The western portion of Massachusetts consists approximately of the four counties of Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden and Berkshire. This set of four counties is sometimes regarded as defining Western Massachusetts; for example, the Western Massachusetts Office of the Governor serves residents of these counties. Towns at the western edge of Worcester County, especially those near the Quabbin Reservoir, may be considered to be in western Massachusetts for some purposes; for example, two Worcester County towns have telephone numbers in western Massachusetts's area code 413. Hampden County, with over half of the population of western Massachusetts, includes the City of Springfield; to the north, Hampshire County contains the college towns of Northampton, Amherst and South Hadley; further north, rural Franklin County borders Vermont and New Hampshire; to the west is Berkshire County, bordering New York, Vermont and Connecticut and the other three counties. After a number of county governments were eliminated in Massachusetts in the late 1990s (including Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden, Berkshire and Worcester), most county functions were assigned to the state government. The municipalities of Franklin and Hampshire counties then organized two voluntary county-oriented "regional councils of government". Attitude towards Eastern Massachusetts/Boston[edit] Some residents of Western Massachusetts are critical towards Boston, the state's capital and largest city. This group believes that the Massachusetts legislative and executive branches know little of and care little about Western Massachusetts, which comprises 20% of the total population of the state.[32] Among the incidents that have created this feeling: The dismantling, submerging and disincorporation of four Western Massachusetts towns, Prescott, Enfield, Greenwich (formerly in Hampshire County) and Dana (formerly in Worcester County), to build the Quabbin Reservoir that supplies water to Boston. Also disruption of small towns accompanying flood control projects such as Knightville Reservoir and Cobble Mountain Reservoir, and construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Extreme inequities in additional state assistances per capita for Western Massachusetts cities compared with Eastern Massachusetts cities—for example, in 2006, for every $278.66 Boston received, its neighbor Cambridge received $176.37, Greater Boston's westernmost city, Worcester, received $67.50, while the City of Springfield received $12.04 per person.[33] Former state House Speaker Tom Finneran's use of parliamentary rules to deny Northampton an election to fill a vacant House seat.[34][35] Abolishing county governance[36] placed formerly local property and employees under the direct administration of the eastern capital. This also affected representation of low-population/large-land rural towns which previously relied on their county seat in budgeting of road maintenance funding. Long a haven for small, independent businesses, Western Massachusetts has expressed conflicted feelings towards big box corporations, leading to controversies about zoning changes and variances that would allow companies such as Wal-Mart to build in Western Massachusetts towns. The debate has been particularly strong in northern towns; for example, in Greenfield, Massachusetts and Hadley, Massachusetts.[37] Transportation[edit] See also: Transportation in Massachusetts Interstates[edit] I-84 I-90 I-91 I‑291 I‑391 U.S. Routes[edit] US 5 US 7 US 20 US 202 State highways[edit] Route 2 Route 2A Route 5A Route 7A Route 8 Route 8A Route 9 Route 10 Route 19 Route 20A Route 21 Route 23 Route 30 Route 32 Route 33 Route 38 Route 41 Route 43 Route 47 Route 57 Route 62 Route 63 Route 66 Route 67 Route 71 Route 75 Route 78 Route 83 Route 97 Route 102 Route 106 Route 112 Route 122 Route 141 Route 142 Route 143 Route 147 Route 159 Route 168 Route 181 Route 183 Route 186 Route 187 Route 189 Route 192 Route 225 Route 295 Bridges and tunnels[edit] Hoosac Tunnel Airports[edit] Logan International Airport in Boston, 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of downtown Boston, New England's largest transportation center Great Barrington Airport Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, New Hampshire North Adams Airport Northampton Airport Orange Municipal Airport Pittsfield Municipal Airport Turners Falls Airport Westover Airport Worcester Regional Airport Nearby airports in other states[edit] Albany International Airport, West of the Berkshires in upstate New York Bradley International Airport, South of Springfield in Connecticut Rail and bus[edit] See also: Hartford Line (Amtrak) The Hartford Line provides regular commuter rail service between Springfield, Hartford, and New Haven, with tentative plans to increase service frequency and provide additional stops[38] Amtrak operates three lines through Western Massachusetts. All three stop at Springfield Union Station.

Olver Transit Center (Greenfield, MA). CTRail's Hartford Line started operating to Union Station-Springfield as the northern terminus. Trains operate from New Haven, CT with multiple stops in Connecticut along the way. The New Haven–Springfield Line was upgraded in conjunction with the launch of the Hartford Line service. The project received funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Federal Government, and the State of Connecticut. Amtrak trains on the route between New Haven and Springfield reach speeds of 110 mph (177 km/h). Central Corridor Rail Line A proposed line is under review from New London, CT.

Do you agree that same-sex couples or groups should not be allowed to adopt and raise children? Do you agree that schools cannot require children to participate in education pertaining to sexual behaviour or euthanasia if the children or their parents don’t agree?[11] A fourth question on registered partners was rejected by the Constitutional Court.[1] In order for the proposal to be approved, voter turnout needed to be at least 50%.[1] Campaign[edit] Supporters of the referendum campaigned predominantly in churches,[12] with the Conference of Slovak Bishops raising funds for the campaign.[13] 62% of Slovaks identify as Catholics, and although less than 40 percent of those attend mass regularly, Reuters describes Slovakia as "one of the most religious countries in Europe on the surface".[4] The vote, which cost more than €6.3 million to run, led to conservative groups spending around €110,000 on advertisements.[14] The Christian conservative activism platform CitizenGo, run by Brian S. Brown, the American founder of the National Organization for Marriage, supported the referendum.[15] Slovakia's LGBT groups, which are smaller and less organised than their opponents, encouraged people not to vote at all, for fear that "no" voters might push turnout over 50%.[11][16][17] Reactions[edit] Former Slovak Prime Minister Iveta Radičová said that if the referendum passes, "It will not improve the standing of families and marriages; and there won’t be any more children, either."[18] She criticised the referendum as being pushed by people "want to cover up the real problems" in Slovakia, like "balancing of work responsibilities with childcare, unemployment," financial insecurity and domestic violence. Radičová described the movement as motivated by "the fear of the new, the unknown, and the other" and condemned opposition to sex education, pointing out that it is proven to reduce sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, and delay sexual experimentation. The libertarian party Freedom and Solidarity criticised the referendum,[8] as did the EU parliament's Socialists and Democrats.[3] Boris Dittrich criticised the involvement of American Evangelical donors like Alliance Defending Freedom in determining the social agenda in Eastern European democracies, when they had lost on same-sex marriage in America.[19] Amnesty International has condemned the country's discrimination against LGBT people[20][21][22] and the international media, including The Economist, critiqued the political process in the country.[23] Gay rights groups criticised the referendum, saying "unemployment, social problems and alcoholism" would not be solved by a vote to ban gay marriages or adoptions.[8] International critics criticised the ruling social democratic party for pandering to populist religious homophobia, and critiqued the ballot as a waste of millions of euros,[24] and a distraction from Slovakia's economic woes,[25] and "genuine problems of Slovak public policy."[26] Pope Francis supported the referendum, blessing the opponents of gay rights, stating “I greet the pilgrims from Slovakia and, through them, I wish to express my appreciation to the entire Slovak church, encouraging everyone to continue their efforts in defense of the family, the vital cell of society.”[27][28][29] A group of theologians issued a position paper claiming that the referendum is touching on ethical questions and those should be solved by discussion rather than by voting. The authors of the position Ondrej Prostredník, František Ábel and Igor Kišš, all from the Lutheran Theological Faculty of Comenius University in Bratislava also claimed that several times in history the way of shortcuts and authoritarian decisions in favor of Christian values proved to be bad and damaged the very cause of Christ’s Gospel. They also criticized the referendum as an immoral attempt to shift the responsibility for the crisis of family values in the Slovak society to homosexuals. The position paper as joined by 48 theologians and intellectuals from different churches and sectors of the society.[30] Another EU nation, Croatia, banned same-sex marriages in a constitutional referendum on 1 December 2013. Turnout in Croatia was also less than 50%, but its constitution does not invalidate a referendum based on turnout. Opinion polls[edit] A Eurobarometer poll on in 2006 found that 19% of Slovaks supported same sex marriage and 81% opposed, while 12% supported and 84% opposed LGBT adoption.[31] A European Social Survey in 2010 found that 42% of Slovaks believe that “gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own lives as they wish.”[32] Polls suggested that only 35% of the population intended to vote in the referendum, with 85% of respondents supporting the first motion banning same sex marriage, 78% supporting a ban on LGBT adoption, and 70% supporting the third question on sex education.[33] Opposition towards the referendum questions was higher amongst students, single people, those under 35, supporters of the libertarian party Freedom and Solidarity, those with openly gay family members or colleagues, people who live in more progressive town environments, and atheists and people with weaker religious beliefs. Results[edit] The referendum was deemed invalid due to low turnout, with just 21.4% of eligible voters casting votes,[34] far short of the 50% required for the results to be legally binding.

Stehlík and Loužná 7 References History[edit] The first written mention of the village dates back to 1558[1] when the village named Loužná is listed in the property of Adam of Sternberg. The village was a part of the Zelenohorské and then a plan estate, owned by the Šternberks and later Martinice. No information is known about the establishment of the village, but it is likely to be related to the operation of the Cistercian monastery under Zelena Hora. The name Loužná means a floodplain village (ie a village lying near a puddle, "lúžě"). Old Czech dictionaries do not accurately reflect the word "lúžě", but it seems that the word also referred to a slightly larger water surface than the word puddle, pool. In the past, the name of the village was recorded in the form: Lauzna, Laucžna or Lauschna. The village has two parts: Stankovy (no. 28 to the north) and Loužná (no. 11 to the south). On the map of the first military survey from the 1860s the village is captured without the later part of Stankovy. At that time, the individual houses were situated practically only around a relatively large village square, on which a large cross was drawn, which preceded the local chapel, and a small pond. Part of Stankovy began to be built in the first half of the 19th century. At present, Loužná is an integrated municipality of Myslív, including the Myslív parish. Chapel of the Virgin Mary Queen[edit] The chapel on the village square in Loužná was built in 1920. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary Queen and the pilgrimage is celebrated here on the first Sunday after 24 August. It's rectangular in shape, the roof is covered with tiles. In the 1970s a major repair of the interior of the chapel was made and was plastered from the outside. In 2009 - 2010 the chapel acquired a new roof and a copper bell tower. In front of the chapel stands a monument to the fallen soldiers of the I. and II. World War II, which was in 2011 replaced by a new granite monument and a new plaque. Genealogy and Immigration to America[edit] So far, about 65 people born in Loužná have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on FamilySearch. The earliest was probably Vaclav Sabek, who immigrated to Baltimore in 1870. He was soon followed by Anna Smolikova, who immigrated with her new husband Frantisek Duspiva in 1870 to St. Louis, Missouri, finally settling in Fayette County, Illinois. Several members of the Koncal, Urs, and Stipek families died tragically.

It is a nature reserve "V Morávkách". Luhanův mlýn[edit] Luhanův mlýn with a pond is not far from the village. Since 1870 the mill belonged to František and Anna Melichar. Around 1900 the miller Petr Mareš was sitting on the mill and this surname remained connected with the mill until the 1970s. It grinded even during the war. After 1948 the mill served as a feed store. Now it is listed as a holiday house. In the middle of the last century, the pond at the mill was filled, it was named Luhanův. L. Stehlík and Loužná[edit] It is known from the stories of witnesses that Ladislav Stehlík often visited the "U Čistotů" building No. 45 here today.

He has served in the government of Austria as Minister of Transport and Economy from June 1986 to April 1992.[1] Streicher is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ). Life and career[edit] Born in Wallsee-Sindelburg, Streicher was an apprentice in the Voest Alpine AG. He later attended the University of Leoben.

The name Christie originated from Italy in 1222,[citation needed] and derives from the Greek names Christos (a reference to Christ, literally 'anointed one') and Christiana (meaning 'follower of Christ').[citation needed] The name Christy appears in Ireland in 1345,[citation needed] and is a common masculine name there. When used as a personal name in English, it is usually a diminutive form of the personal names Christian, Christopher, etc. (masculine), or Christine, Christina, etc. (feminine). In modern name-your-baby books and websites, the name has been assigned other connotations, such as 'angel', 'elegant', 'graceful', 'beautiful', 'lovely', even 'princess', but these are fanciful notions without etymological support.

The company manufactured centrifugal radiators, carburetors, and micrometers, before branching into assist motors and bicycles. The moped originally created during World War II and mass-produced between 1946 and 1988 came in various iterations, whilst keeping the same concept of a motor with roller resting on the front wheel of a bicycle. Referred to the company's advertisement as the 'bicycle which drives itself' (« la bicyclette qui roule toute seule »), it became extremely popular with school children, students or plant workers because it was light and extremely economical.

History[edit] The Solex motorized bicycle was conceived during World War II and marketed in 1946, with 8 million being sold between 1946 and 1988 in France and internationally, having been marketed in some 70 countries. The French design ceased production in 1988.[1] It lived on for almost two decades as a licensed design produced in China and Hungary. Production returned to France in 2005, and as of 2011[update] the S4800 model was being marketed by VeloSolex America in North Bergen, New Jersey.[2] Models and modifications[edit] 1941: Prototype created of which only a few remain, based on a bicycle 1946: A 45 cc model, of which many evolutions were made, with a 45 cc engine developing 0.4 hp (0.30 kW) and no clutch, the engine has to be restarted every time the rider comes to a stop 1953: Model 330 with a 49 cc engine and 0.5 hp (0.37 kW) using the same frame as the 45 but boosting power 1955: Model 660 with a new dedicated bicycle frame, but an unchanged engine 1957: Model 1010 updates the engine 1958: Model 1400 1959: Model 1700 uses the same frame as the previous version but introduce an automatic clutch and air cooling of the engine 1961: Model S2200 with an engine which power is boosted to 0.7 hp (0.52 kW) over the next three years to version will be produced V1 and V2 1964: Model S3300 with a new square tube frame which will remain the same until end of production, adds a drum brake on the rear wheel 1966: Model S3800, which is the most common and most sold version of the brand over the years, later a Luxure or 'Luxe' version "S3800 luxe" and "S3800 super luxe" introduce color to the frame which was always black (including the motor) until then, as well as having large wheels with blackwall tires. In 1968, the twist grip appear allowing to reduce throttle at stops A smaller (children's) version is produced, the F4 with a replica plastic motor emitting clicking sounds to replicate the adult version 1968: the Micron, which has very small wheels and no pedals.

It is not produced under the Solex brand but rather Mopex 2011: Model 'e-Solex', an electric motor powered bicycle which can be folded; Model 'Solexity', an electric motor powered bicycle with an axle transmission Electric[edit] As of 2012[update], the French company offered three products: Velosolex — an electric folding bike which can reach speeds of up to 25 km/h (16 mph) and has a range of up to 50 km (31 mi).[3] Solexity — an electric assisted bicycle which can reach speeds of up to 25 km/h (16 mph) [Pedelec norm] and has a range of up to 60 km (37 mi).[4] e-Solex — an electric bike which can reach speeds of 25–35 km/h (16–22 mph) and has a range of up to 40 km (25 mi).[5] In popular culture[edit] In the 1958 French comedy Mon Oncle, the main character Monsieur Hulot (Jacques Tati) is a day-dreaming and impractical uncle who, while perplexed by the cutting-edge lifestyle of his sister and brother-in-law, still maintains a VéloSoleX motorized bicycle as his main transportation. Primo Levi, in one of the autobiographic short stories in his collection The Periodic Table, mentions that he would be able switch from a bicycle to a VéloSoleX if he managed to conclude a business deal with a cosmetics manufacturer.[6] In the 2007 film Mr. Bean's Holiday, the titular character attempts to hitchhike on an elderly man's VéloSoleX to get to Cannes, only to weigh the back of it down, and when the latter gets off to fix the problem, Mr Bean uses this as an opportunity to hijack the bike, but fails. In the 1975 Sydney Pollack thriller Three Days of the Condor, Robert Redford rides a Solex to work in New York which sets his character as an unassuming intellectual. He thwarts two youths who try to steal it.

Derived from the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, the phrase is often used to express the distinct Dominican theory of Christian vocation, and for that reason it became a motto of the Order.[1] Contents 1 Original text 2 Dominican spirituality 3 References 4 External links Original text[edit] In his Summa Theologiae, begun in 1265 circa 50 years after St. Dominic founded the Dominican Order, St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that "Vita contemplativa simpliciter est melior quam activa quae occupatur circa corporales actus, sed vita activa secundum quam aliquis praedicando et docendo contemplata aliis tradit, est perfectior quam vita quae solum contemplatur, quia talis vita praesupponit abundantiam contemplationis. Et ideo Christus talem vitam elegit" (Summa Theologiae, III, Q. 40, A. 1, Ad 2). A translation is: "the contemplative life is, absolutely speaking, more perfect than the active life, because the latter is taken up with bodily actions: yet that form of active life in which a man, by preaching and teaching, delivers to others the fruits of his contemplation, is more perfect than the life that stops at contemplation, because such a life is built on an abundance of contemplation, and consequently such was the life chosen by Christ."[2] The literal expression comes from his treatment of the contemplative and active lives in the Second Part of the Summa Theologiae, where he states that, "just as it is better to enlighten than merely to shine, so is it better to give to others the fruits of one's contemplation (contemplata aliis tradere) than merely to contemplate (contemplari)." (Summa Theologiae, II-II Q. 188, A. 6) Dominican spirituality[edit] The phrase came to express the essence of the vocation and spirituality of the Dominicans, and is a principal motto of the Order. Since the foundation of the Order in 1216 by Saint Dominic and under his direct inspiration, the Dominicans dedicated themselves to the meditation and study of Sacred Scripture while having the explicit objective of serving in apostolic ministry, which for them is the fruit of their contemplative life.

At the end of World War II he served in the United States Army as Lieutenant of chemical weaponry. In 1944 he became a US citizen. In 1948 he earned a PhD in chemistry under Melvin S. Newman at Ohio State University.[2] Wotiz was an instructor and from 1954 an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He went to work in industry at the Diamond Alkali Company in Painesville in 1957. There he was involved in authoring 44 patents. In 1962 he became a professor at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, and in 1967 at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.[2] External video SIU Connections Kekule Riddle, PBS, March 22, 1993 In 1980 Wotiz was Chairman of the History Division of the American Chemical Society. Starting in 1971 he organized trips to Europe regarding the history of chemistry. As a chemical historian, he was particularly concerned with August Kekulé.[5][6][7][8][9] He was involved in establishing a center for the history of chemistry, the Chemical Heritage Foundation (now the Science History Institute).[10][2] Wotiz retired in 1989. He was particularly committed to international exchange with Eastern Europe and was involved in comparative studies of chemical education in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Asia.[2] He and his wife Kathryn died as a result of a car accident on August 21, 2001.[3][1] Awards[edit] In 1982 Wotiz received the Dexter Award, in part for his contributions to the establishment of a center for the history of chemistry.[11][10] In 1998 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Technical University of Ostrava (in his home town) after receiving their gold medal in 1982.[2] Works[edit] The Kekulé riddle : a challenge for chemists and psychologists.

He arrived in Bristol in 1800, and began to design and build unique Federal-style houses for the upper and middle class residents of that town.[1] In 1823, Warren left Providence and went south to Georgetown, South Carolina, where he became a building contractor.[2] In 1826 Warren moved back to Rhode Island, opening an architect's office in Providence.[3] In 1828, he collaborated with fellow Providence architect James C. Bucklin of Tallman & Bucklin in the design of the Westminster Arcade, designing the Westminster Street facade. He joined Tallman & Bucklin formally in 1830, the firm becoming Warren, Tallman & Bucklin. This firm was dissolved the following year, although they occasionally collaborated in later years.[4] Warren would become the foremost architect in southeastern New England, working as far away as Plymouth. For a few months in 1835 and 1836, Warren worked with Alexander J. Davis in New York, who had recently left his partnership with Ithiel Town. The Congregational Church in New Bedford was conceived under Davis at this time, but was built by Warren after he had returned to Providence. Although he had never been to Greece, Warren was a master of Greek architectural styles.[5] In 1838, he designed a set of three Greek Revival houses within 50 feet of each other on Hope Street in Bristol. Each house represented one of the different Greek styles: an Ionic house for future governor Francis M. Dimond, a Corinthian house for Captain Josiah Talbot, and a Doric house for Captain John Fletcher.[5] The latter is now demolished.[5] Warren continued in solo practice until 1846, when he took his son Osborn Warren as partner. The new firm was known as Russell Warren & Son, and lasted for two years, when Russell and Osborn are listed separately in the directory.[6] From then until his death, Warren practiced independently. His commissions waned in the 1850s, owing to the emergence of other architects such as Thomas A. Tefft and Alpheus C. Morse. Warren died in 1860. In 1842, at the dedication at New Bedford of Warren's new Parker House, the president of the corporation said of Warren and Providence, "Her architects have made it a “City of Palaces”; she has furnished us with hosts who will give to the world a stranger’s welcome."[7] Architectural works[edit] William DeWolf House (1808, demolished) Russell Warren, 1800–1823 and 1826–1830[edit] William van Doorn House, 86 State St., Bristol, RI (1807)[8] Hey-Bonnie Hall (William DeWolf House), 127 Poppasquash Rd., Bristol, RI (1808) - Demolished 1944.[9] Russell Warren House, 92 State St., Bristol, RI (1810)[8] Thomas Nelson House, 82 State St., Bristol, RI (1810)[8] Linden Place (George DeWolf House), 500 Hope St., Bristol, RI (1810)[8] Benjamin Bosworth House, 515 Hope St., Bristol, RI (1815) - Demolished.[10] Westminster Arcade, 130 Westminster St., Providence, RI (1827–28) - Designed in association with Tallman & Bucklin.[11] Bristol County Courthouse, 441 County St., New Bedford, MA (1828–31)[12] Westminster Congregational Church, 121 Mathewson St., Providence, RI (1828–29) - Later the Rialto Theatre.

The station is located on the southern part of the Northeast Corridor, between the Newark, DE and Aberdeen, MD stations. Although Amtrak does not regularly serve the station, a single Amtrak train—Northeast Regional No. 111—stops at Perryville to board MARC ticket holders traveling south.[3] The station is also the northernmost in the MARC system and the terminus for the Penn Line.[4] Contents 1 History 2 Station layout 3 References 4 External links History[edit] A Metroliner passes through Perryville station in 1979 The Perryville station was originally built by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad in 1905 and adopted by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and is located within a wye for the PW&B's Port Deposit Branch. When Amtrak took over passenger service in 1971, the station was closed but later in the decade became a stop for the Chesapeake between Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, until it was acquired by MARC.[5] The station was remodeled to its original specifications in 1992,[6] and is located near an Amtrak maintenance facility. The station also contains the Perryville Railroad Museum, open on Sunday afternoons, which includes a model train layout and exhibits about the history of railroads in Perryville.

It is to be contrasted with thermodynamics, which deals with the direction in which a process occurs but in itself tells nothing about its rate. Chemical kinetics includes investigations of how experimental conditions influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield information about the reaction's mechanism and transition states, as well as the construction of mathematical models that also can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction.

Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), first order reactions, and second order reactions, and can be derived for others. Elementary reactions follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reactions has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring equation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction. Gorban and Yablonsky have suggested that the history of chemical dynamics can be divided into three eras.[6] The first is the van 't Hoff wave searching for the general laws of chemical reactions and relating kinetics to thermodynamics. The second may be called the Semenov--Hinshelwood wave with emphasis on reaction mechanisms, especially for chain reactions. The third is associated with Aris and the detailed mathematical description of chemical reaction networks. Factors affecting reaction rate Nature of the reactants The reaction rate varies depending upon what substances are reacting. Acid/base reactions, the formation of salts, and ion exchange are usually fast reactions. When covalent bond formation takes place between the molecules and when large molecules are formed, the reactions tend to be slower. The nature and strength of bonds in reactant molecules greatly influence the rate of their transformation into products. Physical state The physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a reactant is also an important factor of the rate of change. When reactants are in the same phase, as in aqueous solution, thermal motion brings them into contact. However, when they are in separate phases, the reaction is limited to the interface between the reactants. Reaction can occur only at their area of contact; in the case of a liquid and a gas, at the surface of the liquid. Vigorous shaking and stirring may be needed to bring the reaction to completion. This means that the more finely divided a solid or liquid reactant the greater its surface area per unit volume and the more contact it with the other reactant, thus the faster the reaction. To make an analogy, for example, when one starts a fire, one uses wood chips and small branches — one does not start with large logs right away. In organic chemistry, on water reactions are the exception to the rule that homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous reactions ( are those reactions in which solute and solvent not mix properly) Surface area of solid state In a solid, only those particles that are at the surface can be involved in a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid (a weak organic acid) and sodium hydrogen carbonate. On contact with the saliva in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control the rate at which the fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create diverse effects. For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected. Concentration Main article: Rate equation The reactions are due to collisions of reactant species. The frequency with which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more crowded the molecules are, the more likely they are to collide and react with one another. Thus, an increase in the concentrations of the reactants will usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example, combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen). The rate equation shows the detailed dependence of the reaction rate on the concentrations of reactants and other species present. The mathematical forms depend on the reaction mechanism. The actual rate equation for a given reaction is determined experimentally and provides information about the reaction mechanism. The mathematical expression of the rate equation is often given by v = d c d t = k ∏ i c i m i {\displaystyle v={\frac {\mathrm {d} c}{\mathrm {d} t}}=k\prod _{i}c_{i}^{m_{i}}} Here k {\displaystyle k} is the reaction rate constant, c i {\displaystyle c_{i}} is the molar concentration of reactant i and m i {\displaystyle m_{i}} is the partial order of reaction for this reactant. The partial order for a reactant can only be determined experimentally and is often not indicated by its stoichiometric coefficient. Temperature Main article: Arrhenius equation Temperature usually has a major effect on the rate of a chemical reaction. Molecules at a higher temperature have more thermal energy. Although collision frequency is greater at higher temperatures, this alone contributes only a very small proportion to the increase in rate of reaction. Much more important is the fact that the proportion of reactant molecules with sufficient energy to react (energy greater than activation energy: E > Ea) is significantly higher and is explained in detail by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of molecular energies. The effect of temperature on the reaction rate constant usually obeys the Arrhenius equation k = A e − E a / ( R T ) {\displaystyle k=Ae^{-E_{\rm {a}}/(RT)}} , where A is the pre-exponential factor or A-factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the molar gas constant and T is the absolute temperature.[7] At a given temperature, the chemical rate of a reaction depends on the value of the A-factor, the magnitude of the activation energy, and the concentrations of the reactants. Usually, rapid reactions require relatively small activation energies. The 'rule of thumb' that the rate of chemical reactions doubles for every 10 °C temperature rise is a common misconception. This may have been generalized from the special case of biological systems, where the α (temperature coefficient) is often between 1.5 and 2.5. The kinetics of rapid reactions can be studied with the temperature jump method. This involves using a sharp rise in temperature and observing the relaxation time of the return to equilibrium. A particularly useful form of temperature jump apparatus is a shock tube, which can rapidly increase a gas's temperature by more than 1000 degrees. Catalysts Main article: Catalysis Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in a hypothetical endothermic chemical reaction. The presence of the catalyst opens a new reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same. A catalyst is a substance that alters the rate of a chemical reaction but it remains chemically unchanged afterwards. The catalyst increases the rate of the reaction by providing a new reaction mechanism to occur with in a lower activation energy. In autocatalysis a reaction product is itself a catalyst for that reaction leading to positive feedback. Proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions are called enzymes. Michaelis–Menten kinetics describe the rate of enzyme mediated reactions. A catalyst does not affect the position of the equilibrium, as the catalyst speeds up the backward and forward reactions equally. In certain organic molecules, specific substituents can have an influence on reaction rate in neighbouring group participation.[citation needed] Pressure Increasing the pressure in a gaseous reaction will increase the number of collisions between reactants, increasing the rate of reaction. This is because the activity of a gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. This is similar to the effect of increasing the concentration of a solution. In addition to this straightforward mass-action effect, the rate coefficients themselves can change due to pressure. The rate coefficients and products of many high-temperature gas-phase reactions change if an inert gas is added to the mixture; variations on this effect are called fall-off and chemical activation. These phenomena are due to exothermic or endothermic reactions occurring faster than heat transfer, causing the reacting molecules to have non-thermal energy distributions (non-Boltzmann distribution). Increasing the pressure increases the heat transfer rate between the reacting molecules and the rest of the system, reducing this effect. Condensed-phase rate coefficients can also be affected by pressure, although rather high pressures are required for a measurable effect because ions and molecules are not very compressible. This effect is often studied using diamond anvils. A reaction's kinetics can also be studied with a pressure jump approach. This involves making fast changes in pressure and observing the relaxation time of the return to equilibrium. Absorption of light The activation energy for a chemical reaction can be provided when one reactant molecule absorbs light of suitable wavelength and is promoted to an excited state. The study of reactions initiated by light is photochemistry, one prominent example being photosynthesis. Experimental methods The Spinco Division Model 260 Reaction Kinetics System measured the precise rate constants of molecular reactions. The experimental determination of reaction rates involves measuring how the concentrations of reactants or products change over time. For example, the concentration of a reactant can be measured by spectrophotometry at a wavelength where no other reactant or product in the system absorbs light. For reactions which take at least several minutes, it is possible to start the observations after the reactants have been mixed at the temperature of interest. Fast reactions For faster reactions, the time required to mix the reactants and bring them to a specified temperature may be comparable or longer than the half-life of the reaction.[8] Special methods to start fast reactions without slow mixing step include Stopped flow methods, which can reduce the mixing time to the order of a millisecond[8][9][10] The stopped flow methods have limitation, for example, we need to consider about the time it takes to mix gases or solutions and are not suitable if the half-life is less than about a hundredth of a second. Chemical relaxation methods such as temperature jump and pressure jump, in which a pre-mixed system initially at equilibrium is perturbed by rapid heating or depressurization so that it is no longer at equilibrium, and the relaxation back to equilibrium is observed.[8][11][12][13] For example, this method has been used to study the neutralization H3O+ + OH− with a half-life of 1 μs or less under ordinary conditions.[8][13] Flash photolysis, in which a laser pulse produces highly excited species such as free radicals, whose reactions are then studied.[10][14][15][16] Equilibrium While chemical kinetics is concerned with the rate of a chemical reaction, thermodynamics determines the extent to which reactions occur. In a reversible reaction, chemical equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal (the principle of dynamic equilibrium) and the concentrations of the reactants and products no longer change. This is demonstrated by, for example, the Haber–Bosch process for combining nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia. Chemical clock reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction demonstrate that component concentrations can oscillate for a long time before finally attaining the equilibrium. Free energy In general terms, the free energy change (ΔG) of a reaction determines whether a chemical change will take place, but kinetics describes how fast the reaction is. A reaction can be very exothermic and have a very positive entropy change but will not happen in practice if the reaction is too slow. If a reactant can produce two products, the thermodynamically most stable one will form in general, except in special circumstances when the reaction is said to be under kinetic reaction control. The Curtin–Hammett principle applies when determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting rapidly, each going to a distinct product. It is possible to make predictions about reaction rate constants for a reaction from free-energy relationships. The kinetic isotope effect is the difference in the rate of a chemical reaction when an atom in one of the reactants is replaced by one of its isotopes. Chemical kinetics provides information on residence time and heat transfer in a chemical reactor in chemical engineering and the molar mass distribution in polymer chemistry. It is also provides information in corrosion engineering. Applications and models The mathematical models that describe chemical reaction kinetics provide chemists and chemical engineers with tools to better understand and describe chemical processes such as food decomposition, microorganism growth, stratospheric ozone decomposition, and the chemistry of biological systems. These models can also be used in the design or modification of chemical reactors to optimize product yield, more efficiently separate products, and eliminate environmentally harmful by-products. When performing catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline and light gas, for example, kinetic models can be used to find the temperature and pressure at which the highest yield of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline will occur. Chemical Kinetics is frequently validated and explored through modeling in specialized packages as a function of ordinary differential equation-solving (ODE-solving) and curve-fitting.[17] References ^ C.M.

Line traffic. She was later rebuilt as a cruiseship and known under names MS Sundancer and MS Pegasus. She was scrapped in 1995 in Aliağa, Turkey. Contents 1 History 1.1 1975–1984 1.2 1984–1995 2 Facilities 3 References History[edit] 1975–1984[edit] MS Svea Corona was the first of the so-called "second generation French sisters" to be built for Silja Line traffic. The first generation French sisters, MS Aallotar and MS Svea Regina were delivered in 1972 and started year-round ferry traffic between Helsinki, the capital of Finland and Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. After just three years, three new ships of similar but larger construction replaced the first generation ships. The new ships were the Svea Corona and her sisters MS Wellamo and MS Bore Star.[3] These ships started a new era in Baltic Sea ferry traffic, being larger than any previous ferries to have sailed in those waters. On 24 May 1975, the Svea Corona started service for the Silja Line. She damaged her bow thruster during the maiden voyage, and it was not repaired until 10 June of the same year during an extra docking at Vuosaaren telakka, Helsinki.[1] With all three ships in operation, there wasn't enough passenger traffic on the route to support three ships through the entire year. As an initial solution, the Bore Star was chartered to Finnlines for winter seasons 1975-76 and 1976-77 while Svea Corona and Wellamo served the route as a two-ship operation. During the summer seasons, an unusual schedule allowing two daily departures from each port with three ships was adopted instead of the route's normal one daily departure per port arrangement.[3] On 14 April 1977 there was a bomb threat on board the Svea Corona, but it turned out to be false.[citation needed] After September 1977, the Svea Corona served on the Turku–Mariehamn–Stockholm route during the winter season (between September and May) and spent the summer months as a third ship on the Helsinki–Stockholm service. The arrangement lasted until 1981 when larger tonnage was delivered to the Helsinki–Stockholm route, and Svea Corona alongside her sister Bore Star (which had been renamed Silja Star the previous year after a change of ownership) transferred permanently to the Turku–Stockholm service. In 1978, Rederi AB Svea signed a memorandum of agreement to sell Svea Corona to DFDS on delivery of the new Helsinki–Stockholm ship, but this agreement was not exercised and DFDS acquired Effoa's Wellamo instead. On 24 November 1981, Johnson Line purchased Rederi AB Svea, owner of Svea Corona. As a result, the ship lost her original white/black funnel colours and gained Johnson Line's blue/yellow colours.[1] 1984–1995[edit] In February 1984 Svea Corona ceased service with Silja Line, and was sold to Sundance Cruises,[1][2] a company owned by Effoa, Johnson Line and McDonald Enterprises.[1][4] She was rebuilt at Oskarshamns Varv, Sweden as MS Sundancer for cruising on the west coast of North America. However, on what was just her third cruise as the Sundancer, The ship hit a rock on her starboard side on Maud island while trying to turn to starboard to enter Seymour Narrows. She entered Menzies Bay to try to run aground but decided to try to run south in Discovery passage to the Elk Falls Mill to try and come alongside the paper dock. The M/V Seymour Crown, a Tug based at the mill was called out and managed to reverse the starboard list to a port list against the dock and mill employees managed to remove all on board with no loss of life. In August 1984 the Sundancer was refloated and towed into Burrard Shipyard, Vancouver, where she was examined and declared a constructive total loss. The ship was left laid up at the shipyard, awaiting potential buyers.[1] In November 1984 she was sold to the Greece-based Epirotiki Line, and during December 1984 the ship was towed to Pireus, Greece, where she was restored during the year 1985 as the cruise ship MS Pegasus.[1][2] During early 1986 she was chartered to V.T.C. for cruising on the east coast of South America. Between May and September of the same year she returned to Vancouver, where she was laid up as a hotel ship. After the charter she was used by Epirotiki Lines on cruises on the Mediterranean and between 1989 and 1990 also on the Caribbean.[1][2] On June 2, 1991 a fire broke out onboard while the ship was in Venice, preparing to depart on a product exhibition cruise for Bosch.[1] She partially sank in the shallow waters, and was declared a total constructive loss for the second time. In August of the same year she was towed to Pireus where she was laid up for the next three years awaiting buyers.[1][2] Finally in 1994 a buyer emerged. The Greece-based Strintzis Lines purchased the ship and renamed her Ionian Express, with intention to rebuild her as a car-passenger ferry for their Swansea Cork Ferries (although officially renamed Ionian Express, this name was never painted on her hull[5]). A fire broke out in her engine room while the rebuilding at Perama, Greece, and for a third time the ship was declared a total constructive loss. No further buyers were found to restore the ill-fated ship, and she was towed to the scrapyard in Aliağa, Turkey, on 29 March 1995,[3] and was subsequently broken up.[1][2] Her engines were sold to Med Link Line and installed on their M/S Agios Andreas.[1] Facilities[edit] Interior features of the Svea Corona (and her sisters) included a sauna and swimming pool, several restaurants, conference facilities for 140 people, a night club, movie theatre and a children's playroom.

For other uses, see Neotraditional. Seaside, Florida New Urbanism is an urban design movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating walkable neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types. It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development, urban planning, and municipal land-use strategies. New urbanism attempts to address the ills associated with urban sprawl and post-Second World War suburban development.[1] New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD).[2] These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.[3] Market Street, Celebration, Florida The organizing body for New Urbanism is the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the Charter of the New Urbanism, which begins: We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, ecology, and building practice.[4] New Urbanists support regional planning for open space; context-appropriate architecture and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres;[5] and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in suburban sprawl. The Charter of the New Urbanism also covers issues such as historic preservation, safe streets, green building, and the re-development of brownfield land. The ten Principles of Intelligent Urbanism also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches. Architecturally, new urbanist developments are often accompanied by New Classical, postmodern, or vernacular styles, although that is not always the case. The movement's principles are reflected in the field of Complementary architecture.

For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of mass transit the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as streetcar suburbs. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car.[6] Specifically, after World War II urban planning largely centered around the use of municipal zoning ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing middle class. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of automobile dependency. Beach Drive, St. Petersburg, Florida This new system of development, with its rigorous separation of uses, arose after World War II and became known as "conventional suburban development"[7] or pejoratively as urban sprawl. The majority of U.S. citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last fifty years, and automobile use per capita has soared. Celebration, FL Post Office, designed by architect Michael Graves Although New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later, a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the modernist planning techniques being put into practice. Social philosopher and historian Lewis Mumford criticized the "anti-urban" development of post-war America. The Death and Life of Great American Cities, written by Jane Jacobs in the early 1960s, called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects, large car-dependent thoroughfares, and segregated commercial centers that had become the "norm". The French architect François Spoerry has developed in the 60's the concept of "soft architecture" that he applied to Port Grimaud, a new marina in south of France. The success of this project had a considerable influence and led to many new projects of soft architecture like Port Liberté in New Jersey or Le Plessis-Robinson in France.[citation needed] Rooted in these early dissenters, the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the "European" city proposed by architect Leon Krier, and the pattern language theories of Christopher Alexander. The term "new urbanism" itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s,[8][9] but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.[10] In 1991, the Local Government Commission, a private nonprofit group in Sacramento, California, invited architects Peter Calthorpe, Michael Corbett, Andrés Duany, Elizabeth Moule, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Stefanos Polyzoides, and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the Ahwahnee Principles (after Yosemite National Park's Ahwahnee Hotel), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.[11] Calthorpe, Duany, Moule, Plater-Zyberk, Polyzoides, and Solomon founded the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993. The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members, and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles. It holds annual Congresses in various U.S. cities. In 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are "a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world". They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a "culture of permanence".[12] New Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales. And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant, New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning, architecture, and public policy.[13] Defining elements[edit] New Urbanism Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the Victorian neighborhoods of New Haven, Connecticut. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following: A park in Celebration, Florida Great King St, New Town, Edinburgh The neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center. Most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly 0.25 miles (0.40 km). There are a variety of dwelling types — usually houses, rowhouses, and apartments — so that younger and older people, singles and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live. At the edge of the neighborhood, there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household. A small ancillary building or garage apartment is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work (for example, an office or craft workshop). An elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home. There are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away. Streets within the neighborhood form a connected network, which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination. The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles. Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor room. Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys. Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, and religious or cultural activities. Terminology[edit] A Mediterranean Revival house in Celebration, Florida Several terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development[14] or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the "new" moniker. The term "Walkable Urbanism" was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger.[15] Many debate whether Smart Growth and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe[16] and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term sustainable development is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the United Nations and Agenda 21 to include human development issues (e.g., developing country) that exceed the scope of land development intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or Sustainable Urbanism. The term "livability" or "livable communities" was popular under the Obama administration,[17] though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the Local Government Commission.[18] A Key West style house in Baldwin Park, Florida Planning magazine discussed the proliferation of "urbanisms" in an article in 2011 titled "A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms".[19] Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including Sustainable Urbanism and Tactical Urbanism[20] (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide.[21] In 2011 Andres Duany authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design.[22] In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder Andres Duany began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism[23] which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism. Other terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski,[24] Ecological Urbanism, and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. Landscape urbanism was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University.[25] Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents, edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of urbanism.[26] Organizations[edit] New urbanist Sankt Eriksområdet quarter in Stockholm, Sweden, built in the 1990s. (More photos) The primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions. CNU members promote the principles of CNU's Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including: Livable streets arranged in compact, walkable blocks. A range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels. Schools, stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking, bicycling or transit service. An affirming, human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces. The CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings. The CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters.[27] By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more. As of 2013[update], Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states. While the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU),[28] the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism. By 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the Savannah College of Art and Design, University of Georgia, University of Notre Dame, and the University of Miami. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C. and began developing a "Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists". The Next Generation of New Urbanists held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually as of 2014[update] with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first Tactical Urbanism Guide.[29] The CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the New Urban News and the New Town Paper. Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies. In the United Kingdom New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment. Around the world, other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as INTBAU, A Vision of Europe, Council for European Urbanism, and others. The CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of Smart Growth also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism. In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the United States Green Building Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop the LEED for Neighborhood Development standards, and with the Institute of Transportation Engineers to develop a Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS) Design manual. Film[edit] The New Urbanism Film Festival[30] was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics. The 2011 film Urbanized by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen Dunham-Jones[31] and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States. The 2004 documentary The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream argues that the depletion of oil will result in the demise of the sprawl-type development.[32] Criticism[edit] The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this article, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new article, as appropriate. (February 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) New Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the political spectrum.[33] It has been criticized both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers. Journalist Alex Marshall has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans.[34] In a 1996 article in Metropolis magazine, Marshall denounced New Urbanism as "a grand fraud".[35] The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the Washington Post in September of the same year,[36] and in Marshall's first book, How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken.[37] Critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence.[38] Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments,[39][40] but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.[41] Some parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that "communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car".[4] Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of car-free developments. Steve Melia proposes the idea of "filtered permeability" (see Permeability (spatial and transport planning)) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.[42] In response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism's claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, LEED-ND, was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU),[43] to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design.[44] New Urbanist and board member of CNU Doug Farr has taken a step further and coined Sustainable Urbanism, which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure. Criticizing the lack of evidence for low greenhouse gas emissions results, Susan Subak[45] has pointed out that while New Urbanism emphasizes walkability and building variety, it is the scale of dwellings, especially the absence of large houses that may determine successful, low carbon outcomes at the community level. New Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, "instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves".[46] It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.[47] Examples[edit] Main article: Examples of New Urbanism United States[edit] New Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region.[citation needed] Miami, Florida has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.[48] More than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of smart growth legislation. In the mid-1990s, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibillion-dollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide. New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations. Most were driven by the private sector, but many, including HUD projects, used public money. Prospect New Town Founded in the mid-1990s, Prospect New Town is Colorado's first full-scale New Urbanist community.[49] Developer Kiki Wallace worked the firm of Duany Plater Zyberk & Company to develop the 32-acre (130,000 m2) neighborhood that was formerly his family's tree farm. Currently in its final phase of development, the neighborhood is intended to have a population of approximately 2,000 people in 585 units on 340 lots. The development includes a town center interwoven into the center of the residential area, with businesses ranging from restaurants to professional offices. The streets are oriented to maximize the view of the mountains, and the traditional town center is no more than five minutes on foot from any place in the neighborhood. University Place in Memphis[edit] In 2010, University Place in Memphis, Tennessee became the second only U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED certified neighborhood. LEED ND (neighborhood development) standards integrates principles of smart growth, urbanism and green building and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC, Congress for the New Urbanism, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. University Place, developed by McCormack Baron Salazar, is a 405-unit, 30-acre (120,000 m2), mixed-income, mixed use, multigenerational, HOPE VI grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site.[50] The Cotton District[edit] The Cotton District in Starkville, Mississippi was the first New Urbanist development, begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized.[51] The District borders Mississippi State University, and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants, bars and retail. The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill. Seaside[edit] Seaside, Florida, the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on 80 acres (324,000 m²) of Florida Panhandle coastline. It was featured on the cover of the Atlantic Monthly in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and has become internationally famous for its architecture, and the quality of its streets and public spaces.[52] Seaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie The Truman Show. Lots sold for $15,000 in the early 1980s, and slightly over a decade later, the price had escalated to about $200,000. Today, most lots sell for more than $1 million, and some houses top $5 million.[citation needed] Mueller Community[edit] The Mueller Community is located on the 700-acre (2.8 km2) site of the former Robert Mueller Municipal Airport in Austin, Texas, which closed in 1999. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise 4.2 million square feet of non-residential development, 650,000-square-foot (60,000 m2) of retail space, 4,600 homes, and 140-acre (57 ha) of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete. The Mueller Community also has more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States – a fact partially attributable to an incentive program. Stapleton[edit] The site of the former Stapleton International Airport in Denver and Aurora, Colorado, closed in 1995, is now being redeveloped by Forest City Enterprises.[53] Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30,000 residents, six schools and 2 million square feet (180,000 m²) of retail. Construction began in 2001.[54][55] Northfield Stapleton, one of the development's major retail centers, recently opened. San Antonio[edit] In 1997 San Antonio, Texas, as part of a new master plan, created new regulations called the Unified Development Code (UDC), largely influenced by New Urbanism. One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts: Conservation Development, Commercial Center Development, Office or Institutional Campus Development, Commercial Retrofit Development, Tradition Neighborhood Development, Transit Oriented Development. Each district has specific standards and design regulation. The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns.[56] Mountain House[edit] Mountain House, one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States, is a new town located near Tracy, California. Construction started in 2001. Mountain House will consist of 12 villages, each with its own elementary school, park, and commercial area. In addition, a future train station, transit center and bus system are planned for Mountain House. Mesa del Sol[edit] Mesa del Sol, New Mexico—the largest New Urbanist project in the United States—was designed by architect Peter Calthorpe, and is being developed by Forest City Enterprises. Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full build-out, at which time it should have 38,000 residential units, housing a population of 100,000; a 1,400-acre (5.7 km2) industrial office park; four town centers; an urban center; and a downtown that would provide a twin city within Albuquerque. I'On[edit] Located in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, I'On is a traditional neighborhood development, mixed with a new urbanism styled architecture, reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of Charleston, South Carolina. Founded on April 30, 1995, I'On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl & Partners and Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company, and currently holds over 750 single family homes. Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared public greens and parks, trails and a grid of narrow, traffic calming streets. Most homes are required to have a front porch of not less than eight feet (2.46 m) in depth. Floor heights of 10 feet (3.1 m), raised foundations and smaller lot sizes give the community a dense, vertical feel. Haile Plantation[edit] Haile Plantation, Florida, is a 2,600-household (1,700 acres (6.9 km2)) development of regional impact southwest of the city of Gainesville, within Alachua County. Haile Village Center is a traditional neighborhood center within the development. It was originally started in 1978 and completed in 2007. In addition to the 2,600 homes the neighborhood consists of two merchant centers (one a New England narrow street village and the other a chain grocery strip mall). There are also two public elementary schools and an 18-hole golf course. Celebration, Florida[edit] In June 1996, the Walt Disney Company unveiled its 5,000 acre (20 km²) town of Celebration, near Orlando, Florida. Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996, relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside, whose downtown was nearly complete. Disney shuns the label New Urbanism, calling Celebration simply a "town". Celebration's Downtown has become one of the area's most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a "sense of place".[57] Jersey City[edit] The construction of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail in Hudson County, New Jersey has spurred transit-oriented development. In Jersey City, two projects are planned to transform brownfield sites, both of which have required remediation of toxic waste by previous owners. Bayfront, once site of a Honeywell plant is a 100 acres (0.40 km2) site on the Hackensack River, and is nearby the planned West Campus of New Jersey City University. Canal Crossing, named for the former Morris Canal, was once partially owned by PPG Industries, and is a 117 acres (0.47 km2) site west of Liberty State Park. Old York Village, Chesterfield Township, New Jersey[edit] The sparsely developed agricultural Township of Chesterfield in New Jersey covers approximately 21.61 square miles (56.0 km2) and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s. Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than 7,000 acres (28 km2) of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated "receiving area" known as Old York Village. Old York Village is a neo-traditional, new urbanism town on 560 acres (2.3 km2) incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village. Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.[58][59][60] Civita[edit] Civita is a sustainable, transit-oriented 230-acre (93 ha) master-planned village under development in the Mission Valley area of San Diego, California, United States. Located on a former quarry site, the urban-style village is organized around a community park that cascades down the terraced property.[61] Civita development plans call for 70-acre (28 ha) of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 affordable units), an approximately 480,000-square-foot (45,000 m2) retail center, and 420,000-square-foot (39,000 m2) for an office/business campus.[62][63] Sudberry Properties, the developer of Civita, incorporated numerous green building practices in the Civita design.[64] In 2009, Civita achieved a Stage 1 Gold rating for the U.S. Green Building Council's 2009 LEED-ND (Neighborhood Development) pilot and received the California Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award.[62][65] In 2010, Civita was designated as a California Catalyst Community by the California Department of Housing and Community Development to support innovation and test sustainable strategies that reflect the interdependence of environmental, economic, and community health.[66] Del Mar Station[edit] Del Mar Station, which won a Congress for the New Urbanism Charter Award in 2003,[67] is a transit-oriented development surrounding a prominent Metro Rail stop on the Gold Line, which connects Los Angeles and Pasadena. Located at the southern edge of downtown Pasadena, it serves as a gateway to the city with 347 apartments, out of which 15% are affordable units. Approximately 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) of retail is linked with a network of public plazas, paseos and private courtyards. The 3.4-acre (14,000 m2), $77 million project sits above a 1,200-car multi-level subterranean parking garage, with 600 spaces dedicated to transit. The light rail right of way, detailed as a public street, bisects the site. It was designed by Moule & Polyzoides.[68][69] Norfolk VA East Beach[edit] Norfolk, VA, East Beach. designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages. The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of “New Urbanism” by world renowned TND master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk. Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes, and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay.[70] Other countries[edit] New Urbanism is closely related to the Urban village movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is Poundbury in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall under the overview of Prince Charles. The original masterplan was designed by Leon Krier. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce car dependency had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.[71] The Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.'s New Urbanists. CEU's Charter is a development of the Congress for the New Urbanism Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A New Zealand Urban Design Protocol was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005. There are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent: Europe[edit] Le Plessis-Robinson, a 21st-century example of neo-traditionalism,[72] in the south-west of Paris. This city is in the process of transforming itself, destroying old modern blocklike buildings and replacing them with traditional buildings and houses in one of the biggest worldwide projects with Val d'Europe. In 2008 the city was nominated best architectural project of the European Union.[73] Poundbury, in Dorset, England, is a neotraditionalist urban extension focussed on high quality urban realm and the expression of traditional modes of urban or village life.[74] Tornagrain, Between Inverness and Nairn, Scotland, The design is based on the architectural and planning traditions of the Highlands and the rest of Scotland.[75] Val d'Europe, east of Paris, France. Developed by Disneyland Resort Paris, this town is a kind of European counterpart to Walt Disney World Celebration City. Jakriborg, in Southern Sweden, is a recent example of the New Urbanist movement. Brandevoort, in Helmond, in the Netherlands, is a new example of the New Urbanist movement. Sankt Eriksområdet quarter in Stockholm, Sweden, built in the 1990s. Other developments can be found at Heulebrug, part of Knokke-Heist, in Belgium, and Fonti di Matilde in San Bartolomeo (outside of Reggio Emilia),[76] Italy. Kartanonkoski, in Vantaa, Finland, is the only example of neotraditional architecture in Finland implemented on a larger scale. The area has around 4000 inhabitants and its architecture has been mainly influenced by Nordic Classicism. Americas[edit] Mahogany Bay Village, Belize, is 24-hectare (59-acre) New Urbanist community on Ambergris Caye, Belize. Orchid Bay, Belize, is one of the largest New Urbanist projects in Central America and the Caribbean. Las Catalinas, Costa Rica, is a coastal town in the Guanacaste Province of Northwest Costa Rica. Envisioned as a compact, walkable beach town, Las Catalinas was founded in 2006 by Charles Brewer and incorporates many of the principles of New Urbanism. McKenzie Towne is a New Urbanist development which commenced in 1995 by Carma Developers LP in Calgary. Cornell, within the city of Markham, Ontario, was designed with walkable neighborhoods, density to support public transit, a variety of housing types and retail.[77] New Amherst is a new urbanist development in the town of Cobourg, Ontario. UniverCity, beside the Simon Fraser University campus on Burnaby Mountain in Burnaby, British Columbia, is an award-winning sustainable community that is designed to be walkable, dense, and well connected to public transit networks. Asia[edit] Traffic along Lornie Road, Singapore. The structure plan for Thimphu, Bhutan, follows Principles of Intelligent Urbanism, which share underlying axioms with the New Urbanism. Africa[edit] There are several such developments in South Africa. The most notable is Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. Triple Point is a comparable mixed-use development in East London, in Eastern Cape province. The development, announced in 2007, comprises 30 hectares. It is made up of three apartment complexes together with over 30 residential sites as well as 20,000 sq m of residential and office space. The development is valued at over R2 billion ($250 million).[78] There have been cases where market forces of urban decay are confused with new urbanism in African cities.[79] This has led to a form of suburban mixed-use development that does not promote walkability.[80][81] Australia[edit] Most new developments on the edges of Australia's major cities are master planned, often guided expressly by the principles of New Urbanism. The relationship between housing, activity centres, the transport network and key social infrastructure (sporting facilities, libraries, community centres etc.) is defined at structure planning stage.[5] Tullimbar Village, NSW Australia, is a new development which follows the principles of New Urbanism.[82][failed verification][non-primary source needed] Another important factor or principle of New Urbanism that guides Australia's major cities is how good their foot circulation seems to be which is guided by the wayfinding systems that are implemented. Kenneth B. Hall, Jr. and Gerald A. Porterfield said in their book, "Community by Design," the way to gain good circulation is to take some thoughtful consideration to things like wayfinding, sight lines, transition, visual clues, and reference points.[83] Circulation design should work to create an interesting and informative system that utilizes subtle elements as well as technical ones.[83] City of Port Philip, Australia, is a good example of wayfinding where they have come up with a comprehensive pedestrian signage system, specifically for their local areas of St Kilda, South Melbourne and Port Melbourne.[84][85] The city's wayfinding system consists of 26 individually designed panels that are placed on some major streets such as St Kilda and St Kilda East, linking St Kilda Junction and Balaclava Station to the foreshore via Fitzroy, Carlisle and Acland Streets.[84][85] City of Port Philip also created directional signage systems that makes use of the already existing street furniture such as trash cans to help provide for 130 directional indicators across Port Melbourne.[84][85] 20-minute neighbourhoods[edit] Melbourne followed up a 2014 plan[86] by launching 20-minute neighbourhoods in January 2018, aiming to provide for most daily needs within a 20-minute walk from home, together with safe cycling and public transport options.[87] Another definition has used the time taken to cycle, or take a bus.[88] In Melbourne the concept was initiated in the suburbs of Croydon South, Strathmore, and Sunshine West.[89] The concept has since expanded to other cities, such as Singapore[90] and Hamilton in New Zealand.[91] Critics have pointed out that Melbourne's plan excludes jobs and that a previous target for public transport use has been shelved.[92] The concept has been equated with localism.[86] See also[edit] List of examples of New Urbanism Urban planners, architects and New Urbanists[edit] See also: New Classical Architecture § New Classical Architects Ivan Chtcheglov Walter F.

Conrad's Arrival[edit] Conrad arrived in Charnham in September 2004 to sort out Number 10 Stanley Street, his late father's house. Conrad was pretty rude towards his neighbours at first but then mellowed once Sharon Ingram caught his attention. Relationship with Sharon and arrival of the kids[edit] Conrad and Sharon began dating, but things became difficult when Bradley Foster, Sharon's son faced allegations of molesting Conrad's Neighbour Gary Costello's daughter, Chloe. At about this time, Katie Williams and Alex Williams two of Conrad's children came to live with him, following their mother, Ella's decision to move to Los Angeles. Exit[edit] In October 2005, Conrad left Charnham for Fiji, with his lover Tanya Woods after she had left her husband, John Stokes following her miscarriage.

The main building, known as the Kingswood Building, remains a Grade II listed building.[1] History[edit] The facility has its origins in the Ecclesall Bierlow Union Workhouse which was designed by William Flockton and opened in 1844.[2] The dining hall and nurses' home were damaged by enemy bombing in December 1940 during the Second World War.[2] It became Nether Edge Hospital in 1929 and joined the National Health Service in 1948.[2] The main hospital closed in 1990 and most of the site was acquired by Gleeson Homes in 1997 and subsequently developed for residential use.[3] Some of the newer buildings, located off Osborne Road, were retained by the NHS and amalgamated to form the Michael Carlisle Centre which was officially opened as a mental health facility by the Duchess of Gloucester in October 1999.[4] Gallery[edit] The Right Lodge The Left Lodge The workhouse offices References[edit] ^ Historic England.

It is considered one of the most dangerous highways of Brazil, due to the high number of accidents.[1] Sometimes it is even nicknamed "Rodovia da Morte" (Death Highway).[1] It also leads the number of ambiental accidents in the state of São Paulo. Duplication[edit] Régis Bittencourt was, for the most part, duplicated around the year 2000. However, there was a stretch on a simple track, 19 km long, in the mountain region between Miracatu and Juquitiba, called Serra do Cafezal, in the state of São Paulo. In this stretch, the heavy traffic of heavy cargo vehicles (corresponding to up to 60% of the total), the rugged topography and poor conservation, have been causing increasing traffic jams and fatal accidents, being one of the highways with the highest rate of accidents with fatalities. As of 2008, long negotiations dragged on between the concessionaire and IBAMA, dominated by socialists who hampered the execution of the work, on the route with the least environmental impact and the lowest cost of carrying out the duplication of the most rugged topography stretch Serra do Cafezal, until the final project was released. After protests by the Brazilian population, the concessionaire began the duplication works of Serra do Cafezal, also known as "Serra dos 90", in 2010. The first duplicated sections were partially delivered between 2012 and 2015. The works were fully concluded in December 2017, after bureaucratic obstacles involving environmental licenses.[2] See also[edit] Highway system of São Paulo Brazilian Highway System References[edit] ^ a b "ISTOÉ Online – Travessia mortal" (in Portuguese).

They are called sonic, or acoustic, black holes because these trapped phonons are analogous to light in astrophysical (gravitational) black holes. Physicists are interested in them because they have many properties similar to astrophysical black holes and, in particular, emit a phononic version of Hawking radiation.[1][2] The border of a sonic black hole, at which the flow speed changes from being greater than the speed of sound to less than the speed of sound, is called the event horizon. At this point the frequency of phonons approaches zero.[citation needed] A rotating sonic black hole was used in 2010 to give the first laboratory testing of superradiance, a process whereby energy is extracted from a black hole.[3] Sonic black holes are possible because phonons in perfect fluids exhibit the same properties of motion as fields, such as gravity, in space and time.[1] For this reason, a system in which a sonic black hole can be created is called a gravity analogue. Nearly any fluid can be used to create an acoustic event horizon, but the viscosity of most fluids creates random motion[citation needed] that makes features like Hawking radiation nearly impossible to detect. The complexity of such a system would make it very difficult to gain any knowledge about such features even if they could be detected.[4] Many nearly perfect fluids have been suggested for use in creating sonic black holes, such as superfluid helium, one–dimensional degenerate Fermi gases, and Bose–Einstein condensate. Gravity analogues other than phonons in a fluid, such as slow light and a system of ions, have also been proposed for studying black hole analogues.[5] The fact that so many systems mimic gravity is sometimes used as evidence for the theory of emergent gravity, which could help reconcile relativity, and quantum mechanics.[6] Acoustic black holes were first theorized to be useful by William Unruh in 1981.[7] However, the first black hole analogue was not created in a laboratory until 2009. It was created in a rubidium Bose–Einstein condensate using a technique called density inversion. This technique creates a flow by repelling the condensate with a potential minimum. The surface gravity and temperature of the sonic black hole were measured, but no attempt was made to detect Hawking radiation. However, the scientists who created it predicted that the experiment was suitable for detection and suggested a method by which it might be done by lasing the phonons.[8] In 2014, self-amplifying Hawking radiation was observed in an analogue black-hole laser by the same researchers.[2] See also[edit] Quantum gravity Analog models of gravity Black hole Acoustic metric Optical black hole Notes[edit] ^ a b Visser, Matt (1998).

His first goal came on 21 March 2009, in a 1–3 away loss against Atlético. Deportes Quindío[edit] In 2010, Tesillo moved to Categoría Primera A side Deportes Quindío, along with three other Centauros teammates.[3] He made his debut in the category on 4 April, starting in a 0–1 away loss against Boyacá Chicó. Tesillo scored his first goal in the top tier on 8 May 2011, netting his team's third in a 4–3 home success over Deportivo Pereira.[4] An undisputed starter for the club, and left with 134 official appearances. Junior[edit] On 19 December 2013, Tesillo signed a one-year loan deal with fellow top-tier club Junior.[5] He made his debut for the club the following 25 January, coming on as a late substitute for Luis Enrique Quiñones in a 3–2 win at Atlético Huila.[6] Tesillo became an undisputed starter at the club, and had his loan extended for a further year in December 2014. He left the club after his loan expired, and the club opted to not activate his buyout clause. Santa Fe[edit] On 29 December 2015, Tesillo signed a three-year contract with Independiente Santa Fe.[7] He made his debut for the club on 31 January of the following year by playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 win at Boyacá Chicó.[8] Immediately a first-choice, Tesillo scored his first goal on 21 February 2016, but in a 1–2 away loss against Envigado.[9] He contributed with a career-best four goals in 36 appearances. International career[edit] Tesillo was named in Colombia's provisional squad for Copa América Centenario but was cut from the final squad.[10] On 15 July, he was included in the 18-man squad ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[11] Tesillo appeared in all four matches during the tournament, as his side was knocked out by eventual champions Brazil in the quarterfinals. In May 2018 he was named in Colombia's preliminary 35 man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.[12] However, he did not make the final cut to 23.[13] On June 28, 2019, his missed penalty kick in the shootout, saw Colombia eliminated by Chile in the 2019 Copa America quarterfinals.

The college began when a group of local parents from both Catholic and Protestant traditions came together to seek integrated second level provision in the Armagh City area. The college was an all-ability, co-educational school, open to all children. The school opened in September 2004. It brought secondary level integrated education to the Armagh area, with many new students coming from the local integrated primary school (Saints and Scholars Integrated) and other schools. Due to falling enrollment the closed its doors in August 2009. Many of the remaining students transferred to the integrated college in Dungannon.

He was educated in the East End of London at Coopers' Company School. Career[edit] After a short spell in the securities industry, Brewerton moved into financial journalism working initially for the Exchange Telegraph newswire. In the late sixties he joined the Financial Times and in 1970 moved to the City desk of The Daily Telegraph. Brewerton moved again in 1986 when he helped found The Independent as City Editor and was awarded the London Business School Prize as Financial Journalist Of The Year. During his time at The Independent he was responsible for breaking most of the stories on the notorious Guinness Affair which led to several leading businessmen—including Gerald Ronson and Ernest Saunders—being sent to prison. In 1988 Brewerton was recruited by Rupert Murdoch as Executive Editor of The Times Business News. At the end of his agreed contract with Murdoch, Brewerton became a partner in the public relations consultancy Brunswick where he advised major corporations on how to deal with the media.[2] He left the business in 2002 to develop his third career as an author and freelance journalist. In journalism, he specialises in writing obituaries of business personalities, principally for the Guardian newspaper. Brewerton's first full-length novel, Impeccable Sources, is due out in 2007 and draws on his long experience of newspapers and in particular of investigative stories. His non-fiction work includes A History of the Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company. Brewerton is a Trustee of The Ragged School Museum Trust References[edit] ^ Fletcher, Richard (29 July 2001). "Squarecanary takes off". Daily Telegraph.

Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes was extremely unreliable. Most east Pacific storms were of no threat to land. Contents 1 Systems 1.1 Hurricane One 1.2 Tropical Cyclone Two 1.3 Hurricane Three 1.4 Hurricane Four 1.5 Hurricane Five 2 See also 3 References Systems[edit] Hurricane One[edit] On June 4, a tropical cyclone formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It paralleled the coast, became a hurricane, and approached the coast. On June 11, it made landfall north of Mazatlán and dissipated inland. Some damage in Mazatlán was reported.[1] Tropical Cyclone Two[edit] From August 18 to 20, a tropical cyclone existed in the waters west of Manzanillo. A ship reported a pressure of 29.63 inHg (100.3 kPa).[2] Hurricane Three[edit] On October 3, a tropical cyclone formed near the Revillagigedo Islands. It slowly moved northeasterly, became very intense, and made landfall north of Mazatlán on October 4 or October 5. Once inland, it greatly increased in speed, and dissipated October 7, while over Arkansas. A ship in the eye of the hurricane reported a pressure of 27.72 inHg (93.9 kPa), low enough to make this the most intense Pacific hurricane in Mexican waters known at the time.[3] This hurricane hassled a number of ships. One of them needed to be repaired at a cost of $10,000 (1930 USD), and another had its cargo damaged.[3] Hurricane Four[edit] On October 9, a tropical cyclone formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Eventually becoming a hurricane, it moved up the coast as far as Acapulco. It was last seen on October 11. The lowest pressure reported was 29 inHg (98 kPa).[3] This hurricane caused damage in Acapulco. Many buildings were demolished by the storm, and roads and telegraph lines were destroyed.[4] Damage to property was heavy, but no one was killed or injured.[5] Hurricane Five[edit] On October 16, a tropical cyclone existed somewhere between Acapulco and Cape Corrientes.[3] Two days later, it made landfall near La Manzanilla, Jalisco as a hurricane near with a pressure of 98.3 kilopascals (29.0 inHg).[6] It or its remnants managed to cross the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and enter the Bay of Campeche, where they dissipated on October 20.[3] See also[edit] tropical cyclones portal 1930 Atlantic hurricane season 1930 Pacific typhoon season 1930s North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons References[edit] ^ Hurd, Willis (June 1930).

Born in Livorno, Calzabigi spent the 1750s in Paris, where he became a close friend of Giacomo Casanova. Here he explored his interest in opera, producing an edition of the works of Pietro Metastasio, the most famous librettist of opera seria. However, Calzabigi was also impressed by French tragédie en musique, and eager to reform Italian opera by making it simpler and more dramatically effective. In 1761 he settled in Vienna, where he met likeminded reformers: Gluck; Count Giacomo Durazzo, the theatre director; Gasparo Angiolini, the choreographer; Giovanni Maria Quaglio, the set designer; and the castrato Gaetano Guadagni. Together they worked on Gluck's groundbreaking Orfeo ed Euridice in 1762. Calzabigi then wrote the libretto for Alceste, which further abandoned the practices of opera seria in favour of "noble simplicity". In the preface to this work, to which Gluck put his signature, Calzabigi set out his manifesto for reforming opera. A third collaboration, Paride ed Elena, followed in 1770. Calzabigi also contributed to the scenario of Gluck's reformist ballet, Don Juan, in 1761. La finta giardiniera, set by Pasquale Anfossi in 1774 and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1775, has been ascribed to him, but this is now regarded as doubtful.[1] In 1774 Calzabigi was banished from the Viennese court as the result of a scandal and took up residence in Pisa and in 1780 in Naples, where he wrote his last two librettos, Elfrida (1792) and Elvira (1794), both set to music by Giovanni Paisiello, and continued his literary activities until his death.

It has massive walls, its towers topped with slate and a moat with drawbridge. History[edit] Spontin was built in a bend of the Bocq, whose water flows around the castle along some cascading waterfalls The castle belonged to the noble family of Beaufort (named after a castle near Huy). Between 1266 and 1284, Pierre de Beaufort built the main tower which is the core of the castle. In 1288, his son William (Guillaume), nicknamed the "Ardennes", participated in the Battle of Woeringen. For his bravery in battle, in which Henry VII of Luxembourg was defeated, he was rewarded with the fiefdom of Spontin. From that time, the lords of the castle Spontin constantly added various outbuildings up to the 16th century when it gained its present form. Spontin Castle was on a 'dangerous' place in the border region between the County of Namur and the Principality of Liège, and although it was assaulted by armies from Liege, Dinant, Burgundy, and France, it was never taken. The Bocq flows past the castle. From the late sixteenth century, the fortifications became redundant and unnecessary, the castle is transformed into a residence by the drilling of windows and is accented with red bricks and roofs pepper. The last two transformations are the construction of a fortified farm beyond the moat (1622) and demolition of the rear part of the fortifications. In the parade, decorated with an elegant frame of wrought iron sink Van Boeckel (nineteenth century), featuring former dungeon.

The southern part has been decorated in the nineteenth century in the Gothic Revival. Currently, the castle is closed to the public, this is private property. After the fall of the Ancien Régime, the castle was owned by a number of people, until eventually it was purchased by SA Société du Château de Spontin, which entrusted the management of the association Les Cimaises the Spontin. Due to mismanagement of previous owners, the castle is now in a precarious state of neglect.

MLB Little League ClassicBowman Field during the 2017 gameSponsorGEICOFirst played2017SiteBB&T Ballpark at Historic Bowman Field in Williamsport, PennsylvaniaPrevious gameAugust 18, 2019(Chicago Cubs 7, Pittsburgh Pirates 1)Next gameCleveland Indians vs Los Angeles Angels The MLB Little League Classic is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) game held in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, first played during the 2017 Little League World Series.[1] The series is part of MLB's effort to get more children interested in and involved with baseball at a younger age.[2] History[edit] After the success of the Fort Bragg Game between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in July 2016, reports spread that MLB was planning another similar event in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, which is the venue for the annual Little League World Series and home to the Williamsport Crosscutters of Minor League Baseball. Many locals of the area and reporters across the nation thought it was almost impossible due to the size and capacity of BB&T Ballpark, as seating for fewer than 3,000 fans seems much less than ideal for an MLB game. As the reports were dispelled by many, the news faded. However, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch column in early March 2017 stated that MLB was finalizing plans for the game.[3] On March 9, 2017, MLB officially announced the first MLB Little League Classic, selecting the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals as the participants,[4][5] and released the following statement:[6] "Major League Baseball's greatest responsibility is to ensure that today's youth become active participants in our game as players and fans. The 'MLB Little League Classic' exemplifies our entire sport's commitment to building a stronger connection between young people and the National Pastime. Our players will honor the great tradition of the Little League World Series and create lifelong memories for the Little Leaguers, their families and the city of Williamsport. I thank the Pirates and the Cardinals, Little League Baseball, Governor Wolf, the Crosscutters, the City of Williamsport, and ESPN for helping us organize an unforgettable weekend." — Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball Prior to the inaugural game, funding from MLB and grants from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania given to the City of Williamsport provided more than $4 million to improve BB&T Ballpark. These included adding new seats, padding around the infield fence, new irrigation and draining to the field itself, moving the bullpens out beyond the outfield fence, new dugouts closer to home plate, and improved dining areas.[7] Josh Bell had four RBIs in the 2017 game. The Pirates defeated the Cardinals, 6–3, in the first Classic, played on August 20, 2017.[8] In late September 2017, MLB announced that a second Classic would be held in 2018, between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies.[9] On August 19, 2018, the Mets won the second Classic, 8–2,[10] with MLB announcing a third Classic that same day.[11] The third Classic was played on August 18, 2019, with the Chicago Cubs defeating the Pirates, 7–1.[12] The fourth edition was announced for August 23, 2020, between the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles,[13] which was to be the first Classic to be contested between American League teams. The matchup was canceled on April 30, 2020, with the cancellation of the 2020 Little League World Series due to the coronavirus pandemic.[14] The 2021 game has been announced for Sunday, August 22, featuring the Cleveland Indians and Los Angeles Angels.[15] Games[edit] Game Date Winning team Losing team Attendance Ref. 2017 August 20 Pittsburgh Pirates 6 St. Louis Cardinals 3 2,596 [16] 2018 August 19 New York Mets 8 Philadelphia Phillies 2 2,429 [17] 2019 August 18 Chicago Cubs 7 Pittsburgh Pirates 1 2,503 [18] 2020 August 23 Boston Red Sox vs. Baltimore Orioles cancelled [14] 2021 August 22 Cleveland Indians vs. Los Angeles Angels [15] References[edit] ^ "ESPN to cover MLB Little League Classic August 20 in Williamsport". ^ "Pirates and Cardinals will attend the Little League games during the day and the little leaguers will attend the Major League game at night".

Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348 (2004), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a requirement that a different Supreme Court decision requiring the jury rather than the judge to find aggravating factors would not be applied retroactively.[2] Contents 1 Facts 2 Result 3 See also 4 References 5 Further reading 6 External links Facts[edit] In April 1981, Warren Wesley Summerlin killed a creditor who had come to his home in Phoenix, Arizona, to inquire about a debt. He was later convicted of first-degree murder and received a death sentence. Under Arizona law at the time, a jury decided the question of guilt but a judge sitting without a jury decided the question of penalty after receiving evidence regarding aggravating and mitigating factors. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence. While the appeal in his habeas corpus case was pending in the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court decided Ring v. Arizona,[1] which held that such aggravating factors had to be proved to a jury rather than a judge. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Ring decision applied to Summerlin's case even though Ring was decided after Summerlin's conviction had become final on direct review. The state appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. Result[edit] The Court, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and stated that "we give retroactive effect to only a small set of 'watershed rules of criminal procedure implementing the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.' That a new procedural rule is 'fundamental' in some abstract sense is not enough; the rule must be one 'without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Senators (1966–71), Texas Rangers (1972–73), Cleveland Indians (1973–75), and Oakland Athletics (1975–76).[1] Bosman started the final game for the expansion Senators and the first game for the Texas Rangers. He is the only pitcher in Major League history to miss a perfect game due to his own fielding error.[2] Contents 1 Baseball career 2 References 3 Sources 4 External links Baseball career[edit] Bosman was originally signed as an amateur free agent by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1963. Following that season, he was drafted from the Pirates by the San Francisco Giants, and then a year later was drafted again by the Senators.[3] After another season in the minors, he made his major league debut on June 1, 1966. Bosman pitched for the Senators, and later the Rangers, for eight seasons. In 1969 he compiled a 14-5 mark and led the league in earned run average (2.19). He reached a career-high 16 victories in 1970, one of which was a one-hit, 1-0 shutout against Minnesota on August 14. César Tovar gave him the Twins only hit, a single.[4] Early in the 1973 season, Bosman was traded by the Rangers, along with outfielder Ted Ford, to the Indians for pitcher Steve Dunning. On July 19, 1974, Bosman no-hit the defending World Series Champion Oakland Athletics, a team that would go on to win the 1974 World Series to three-peat after winning the World Series in 1972 and 1973. He missed a rare perfect game due only to his own throwing error in the fourth inning, which gave the A's their lone baserunner in a 4-0 Indians victory.[5] The following season, Bosman would be traded to the very team he no-hit, as he was traded by the Indians along with Jim Perry to the A's in exchange for Blue Moon Odom.[6] During the 1975 season, Bosman won 11 games to help Oakland to a division title. He remained with Oakland in 1976, but was released by the A's in spring training of 1977, bringing his baseball career to an end. Bosman compiled 82 wins, 757 strikeouts, and a 3.67 earned run average.[1][7] After retiring, he has served as a pitching coach for the Chicago White Sox (1986–87), Rochester Red Wings (1988–91), Baltimore Orioles (1992–94), Texas Rangers (1995–2000), and he has been a coach in the Tampa Bay Rays' system since 2001. Known for teaching pitchers how to control the running game, he had a hand in developing James Shields, Wade Davis, Jake McGee, Jeremy Hellickson and Alex Cobb. Bosman retired after the conclusion of the 2018 season.[8] Biography portal References[edit] ^ a b Dick Bosman at Baseball Reference ^ Schneider (2005), p. 142; Robbins (2004), p. 240; Boxscore—Game Played on Friday, July 19, 1974 (N) at Cleveland Stadium.

It grew out of the Social Credit Party of Canada, and for most of its existence it was registered under the Social Credit name. Contents 1 Origins 2 Political activities in the 1990s 3 Electoral history 4 References Origins[edit] In 1986, the Rev. Harvey Lainson defeated Holocaust denier Jim Keegstra to become leader of Canada's moribund Social Credit Party. Although Lainson ran on a right-wing platform, he was not associated with Keegstra's ideology. After becoming Social Credit leader, Lainson rebranded the party as the Christian Freedom Party of Canada. According to its official literature, the party was centred on three principles: "God is creator of the universe," "the Bible is the Word of God," and "Jesus Christ is Lord." It also described the human individual as "the most important of all God's creations," and opposed any system of government that was considered to favour the rights of the state over the rights of the individual.[1] When evangelist Ken Campbell became leader of the Social Credit Party in 1990, he continued to describe it as the Christian Freedom Party in public addresses.[2] For tax purposes, it was still called the Social Credit Party on official party documents.[3] Political activities in the 1990s[edit] Campbell announced in 1992 that he would run as a Christian Freedom candidate in the next federal election, but that he had no intention of winning and simply wanted a platform to express his religious convictions. He added that he would encourage voters to support the Reform Party because of its populist leanings. (Campbell had done the same thing in the 1991 Toronto mayoral election, when he entered the campaign to encourage voters to support June Rowlands.) He clarified that his support for Reform was intended as a temporary alliance, and that he would withdraw his support if and when the party abandoned its original goals.[4] As leader of the Christian Freedom Party, Campbell supported traditional social credit economic theory and called for a cap on borrowing charges applied by banks.[5] He also promoted an anti-abortion message.[6] Electoral history[edit] In May 1993, the Government of Canada approved changes to the Canada Elections Act requiring that political parties field at least fifty candidates in general elections to be registered with Elections Canada. Existing parties unable to meet this requirement were to be deregistered and have their assets liquidated. Campbell strongly opposed this legislation and, somewhat improbably, supported the Communist Party of Canada in its bid for an injunction until after the next election.[7] In a letter to Communist leader Miguel Figueroa, he wrote, "While we are obviously poles apart philosophically...we support your democratic right to exercise that freedom of speech and of association."[8] The injunction was not granted, however, and the provisions of the legislation remained in place. Campbell tried to field fifty Christian Freedom candidates in the 1993 federal election, which would have permitted him to officially launch the party under its new name.[9] The party was only able to field around ten candidates, however, and it was deregistered by Elections Canada in October 1993.[10] As a result, its candidates appeared on the ballot as non-affiliated. Campbell ran in Oakville—Milton while anti-abortion protester Linda Gibbons ran for the party in Rosedale. Both identified as Christian Freedom candidates and Campbell also identified as a Social Credit candidate.[11] Douglas Stelpstra and Jim Brink had registered as Social Credit candidates in Brant and Hamilton East before the party was deregistered; Brink described himself as an independent during the campaign and does not seem to have used the Christian Freedom name.[12] It is not clear who the other candidates were. A registered organization called the Canada Party fielded several candidates on a social credit platform in 1993, but it was not aligned with Campbell's group. Campbell later ran in a 1996 by-election in Hamilton East, still identifying as the Christian Freedom Party leader although he appeared on the ballot as an independent.[13] The party was not involved in electoral activities after this time. Campbell retained ownership of the Social Credit Party name until his death, but he did not use it for electoral purposes after 1993.

(March 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Fantasy baseball is a game in which people manage rosters of league baseball players, either online or in a physical location, using fictional fantasy baseball team names.[1] The participants compete against one another using those players' real life statistics to score points. Contents 1 History 2 Rotisserie League Baseball 2.1 Player selection 2.2 Stakes 2.3 Game play 3 Fantasy trade referees 4 New formats 5 Keeper league 6 References History[edit] Materials in the Jack Kerouac Archive at the New York Public Library show that Kerouac (1922–69) played his own form of fantasy baseball starting quite young and continued developing and playing this perhaps private version of fantasy baseball during most of his life. His version of fantasy baseball was completely fictitious, with made up players and statistics. At the Library from November 2007 to February 2008, an exhibition on Kerouac's life and works includes several display cases of Kerouac's highly detailed fantasy baseball records, including charts, sketches, and notes.[2] In 1961, another early form of fantasy baseball was coded for an IBM 1620 computer by John Burgeson, IBM Akron, and distributed for several years by the IBM Corporation. It allowed two teams to play one another using random number generation and player statistics to determine a game's outcome, including a play-by-play description.[3][4] In the fall of 1961, Rege Cordic, a KDKA (Pittsburgh) radio personality, produced a radio show based on the program. The game was coded for a computer with only 20 KB in computer memory and was entirely self-contained. Other early forms of fantasy baseball were sometimes called "tabletop baseball". One of the best-known was APBA, which in 1951 began publishing a game containing customized baseball cards of Major League Baseball players with their stats from past seasons. Participants could then re-create previous seasons using the game rules and the statistics, or compose fantasy teams from the cards and play against each other. The first national fantasy baseball competition, Dugout Derby, was developed in 1989 by Lee Marc, Robert Barbiere and Brad Wendkos of Phoneworks who teamed with west coast ad agency (Wakeman & deForest) to launch the game in 1990 in a number of newspapers throughout the country including the Los Angeles Times, Hartford Courant, Tampa Bay Times, Morning Call, Philadelphia Inquirer, Chicago Sun Times. Archives of Dugout Derby are available online and in most public libraries.[5] Dugout Derby is what current Daily Fantasy Sports are modeled after being the first game to allow large numbers of participants to compete against one another for prizes. Most importantly, Dugout Derby was the first game to convert games statistics to a basic scoring system. Participants created a team of major league players, earned stats (converted to points) for those players based on actual performance, traded those players on a daily basis, and accrued points while competing against one another to win prizes. The group filed and was awarded US Patents 5,018,736A and 5,263,723A, for Interactive Game System and Method; Interactive Contest System.[6] Rotisserie League Baseball[edit] The Rotisserie scoring system was developed independently and popularized in the 1980s by a group of journalists and formalized under the title Rotisserie League Baseball in 1980, named after the New York City restaurant La Rotisserie Française, where its founders met for lunch and first played the game.[7][8] Magazine writer-editor Daniel Okrent is credited with inventing the Rotisserie scoring system, coming up with the idea on a flight to Texas. After presenting his first vision of rotisserie baseball to friends there, none seemed interested.[9] Upon returning to New York a month later, he received an enthusiastic reception from a different group of friends, who then collaborated on the first league to use the system. According to the rules, players (termed "owners") in the Rotisserie League would draft teams from the list of active Major League Baseball players and would follow their statistics "during the ongoing season" to compile their scores. In other words, rather than using statistics for seasons whose outcomes were already known, the owners would have to make similar predictions about players' playing time, health, and expected performance that real baseball managers must make. Because Okrent was a member of the media, other journalists, especially sports writers, were introduced to the game. Many early players were introduced to the game by these sports journalists, especially during the 1981 Major League Baseball strike; with little else to write about, many baseball writers wrote columns about Rotisserie league. Rotisserie league baseball, nicknamed roto, proved to be popular, even in the 1980s when full statistics and accurate reporting were often hard to come by. The traditional statistics used in early Rotisserie leagues were often chosen because they were easy to compile from newspaper box scores and then from weekly information published in USA Today. Okrent, based on discussions with colleagues at USA Today, credits Rotisserie league baseball with much of the early success of USA Today, since the paper provided much more detailed box scores than most competitors and eventually even created a special paper, Baseball Weekly, which almost exclusively contained statistics and box scores. Local papers soon caught up with USA Today's expanded coverage. The advent of powerful computers and the Internet revolutionized fantasy baseball, allowing scoring to be done entirely by computer, and allowing leagues to develop their own scoring systems, often based on less popular statistics. In this way, fantasy baseball has become a sort of real-time simulation of baseball, and allows many fans to develop a more sophisticated understanding of how the real-world game works. According to statistics from a 2009 article in Forbes, nearly 11 million people play fantasy baseball today.[10] Fantasy baseball has continued to grow [based on recent studies from the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA.org)], but has been overtaken by fantasy football as the most popular form of fantasy sports. This is at least in part because some of those sports, such as football and auto racing, only participate once a week, making it easier for players to make adjustments, since they do not have to check their teams daily. Player selection[edit] Rotisserie leagues and their descendants typically draft teams before the season begins (or very shortly thereafter). One approach is to hold an auction, whereby each owner has a fixed amount of money to bid for players, and he must fill his team's roster within their budget. Another approach is to perform a serpentine system draft of available players until all teams are filled. In either case, the skills of the team managers come into play in the "preseason" by their knowledge of the talent and ability to forecast the performance of Major League Baseball players and prospects for the coming season. The team managers draw on a great variety of sources of information, including tout sheets by various forecasters, who predict the coming season's performance and the likely overall "value" (often in terms of auction dollars) of the Major League players. Many leagues allow teams to trade with each other during the season, as well as to replace players who get hurt or stop performing well with players from the pool of those who are not presently owned. However, some leagues prohibit such in-season "free agent" replacements, feeling that the game is more interesting when teams must live and die by the quality of their draft. Also, some leagues limit free-agent moves that a fantasy team can make per season, and a team may not just drop all of their players if they are not progressing well during a season. The free-agent limit is also sometimes used to limit the so-called "pitch-and-ditch" tactic, a method of play in which a manager picks up a free-agent pitcher with the intention of using him in only one game before replacing him with a pitcher who is scheduled to start the following day. Another common limitation on the free agent system is a list of "undroppable players", who are players considered by whatever site is running the game to be too valuable to become free agents. In most leagues, when a player who was injured returns to play, it is the choice of the team manager whom to drop from his team. Usually, they are not forced to drop the replacement. Some companies actually offer real-world insurance on fantasy league players. Baseball has garnered great interest in the daily fantasy sports industry as a legal alternative to sports betting. Termed a skill game, a competitor can pick players from that days game to participate in daily fantasy leagues. Stakes[edit] Many fantasy leagues are played for money. Owners pay an ante or entry fee at the beginning of the season and may also be charged for in-season activity such as trades and "free agent" acquisitions. The pool of money is collected and then distributed to the winner(s) at the end of the season. Most often, however, the main reward of fantasy games is bragging rights or pride in the participants' ability to assess baseball talent. Established leagues often have a plaque or trophy that is passed to the annual champion. Game play[edit] There are different ways to play fantasy baseball. One way to play is a head-to-head format that makes each individual team play against a different team each week to acquire wins through total points scored for the week. Teams with the most wins at the end of the season often enter into a playoff similar to the MLB postseason. The winner is the team that doesn't lose in the playoffs, or has the most points at the end of season if the league does not hold playoffs. Another style, the original style of playing fantasy, is rotisserie. The statistics compiled by the players from each team are then ranked by category, and the team with the highest cumulative rank at the end of the season is determined to be the winner. Fantasy Baseball can be played on numerous websites. The original Rotisserie League used the following statistics: team batting average (total hits divided by total at-bats) total home runs total runs batted in total stolen bases total wins total saves team earned run average (9 times total earned runs divided by total innings pitched, the lower the better) team WHIP (total number of hits and walks allowed by pitchers divided by total innings pitched, the lower the better) This is often called a "4×4" league (four hitting stats and four pitching stats). Many leagues adopt a "5×5" format, with runs scored and strikeouts added as hitting and pitching stats, respectively. Still other leagues are "6×6", most commonly adding OPS (OBP plus SLG), and holds. Occasionally, a league will adopt a format that keeps track of more statistics (such as a "7×7"), vary the stats tracked to favor hitting or pitching, or include fielding statistics such as fielding percentage. Other modifications to the rules include a minimum number of at-bats and innings pitched for categories that are averaged; teams that do not make the minimum were awarded last place in the respective categories. Typical set-ups for head-to-head leagues are: Head-to-Head Rotisserie: Wins, losses and ties are based on the team's performance in individual categories. Head-to-Head One Win: Just like H2H Rotisserie, but the winner receives just one win, rather than one win for each category the team wins. Head-to-Head Points: Stats accumulate points for each team (a Home Run/Stolen Base/etc. is worth a certain number of points), and the team with the most points at the end of the week is awarded a win. These leagues often take advantage of several other statistical categories, from outfield assists to quality starts. Opponents are dictated by a round-robin system. At the end of the season, the team with the best win-loss record is the victor. Many head-to-head leagues also feature playoffs over the last three to four weeks of the MLB regular season. A set number of teams make the "postseason" and play a single-elimination tournament to decide a victor. Fantasy trade referees[edit] The growing popularity of fantasy baseball has created a niche for fantasy baseball trade referees. Owners of fantasy teams often trade players, and often those trades incite disputes within leagues. Third party websites provide fantasy players a place to have their trades reviewed by a panel of "judges" in exchange for a fee. Decisions are rendered based on the specifications, number of teams, statistical catego able to modern-day fantasy players. New formats[edit] New fantasy baseball formats have appeared that combine a traditional points-based competition with a liquid market that is used to facilitate real-time player trading. These games eliminate the need for fantasy trade judging by having team owners buy and sell players on a trading floor instead of negotiating trades directly with other owners. Another new format of fantasy sports is 'daily fantasy sports'. Rather than joining leagues and selecting rosters that compete for an entire season, competitors are able to draft a line-up for a single day and compete against others with cash being awarded to the winner just hours after the games on the field that day have ended. A typical contest would pit two, four or six people against each other. There are also fantasy baseball leagues that specialize in the Major League Baseball playoffs. Many fantasy baseball leagues stop their seasons at the end of the regular season. Simulation games use computer programs, processing actual MLB player statistics, to generate results for contests matching teams comprising MLB players 'drafted' by 'owners.' This is thought to produce an experience which is more akin to that of being a real general manager. Keeper league[edit] Any fantasy baseball pool that "rolls over" into other years is called a "Keeper" or "Dynasty" league. Generally, "Keeper" leagues establish a certain number of players that are allowed to be kept on each team for the next season. "Dynasty" leagues are created for a more realistic General Manager experience, where the team owner has the option to keep all his/her players, as long as they can afford them under the league salary cap. The leagues can be run each year in any of the above formats with a winner declared at the end of each season. At the end of the year team managers decide which players they wish to protect (the number varies – from protecting and keeping all players, to keeping just one player). Before the MLB season opener, a fantasy draft is held to fill out the rest of the roster. Many keeper leagues, as well as some single season leagues, have adopted salary cap rules similar to the NBA. In a "Salary Cap League", a salary is assigned to each player before the manager selects his team. Salaries are usually determined by the MLB player's real salary. Otherwise a number value is assigned – usually by an online baseball pool program – or it is determined through an auction process.[11] Each manager must ensure that they do not go over the predefined salary cap when selecting players. One emerging option for a keeper league is the Draft Round Values system. This is a Sabermetric approach for determining the values of players selected in a particular round. The round a player was selected in the previous season is conceded in the upcoming seasons draft when they are elected to be carried over. Tables are provided with these values and a conversion chart that calculates the rounds to be conceded when multiple players from the same round selected as keepers. These tables also work for balancing multiple player trades. Keeper leagues are especially easy in auction formats, where last year's dollar values can be used to calculate keeper values. At least one league uses this system in combination with a minimum rookie keeper wage scale with great success.[12] Also some leagues have introduced a rookie draft into their fantasy league. By using the rankings from the last season to determine the draft order, last place gets first pick and so on. Also in some leagues, trading picks is allowed, but sometimes, a penalty may be accused for this. References[edit] ^ Garcia, Elsie.

Redden Federal Courthouse, formerly the United States Post Office and Courthouse, is a federal courthouse located in Medford, Jackson County, Oregon, United States. Completed in 1916 under the supervision of architect Oscar Wenderoth, it houses the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. A substantial extension was completed in 1940, under the supervision of architect, Louis A. Simon. In September 1996, the United States Senate enacted a bill introduced by Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield to rename the building for long-serving District Court judge James A. Redden.[3] Contents 1 Significance 2 Architecture 2.1 Site 2.2 Exterior 2.3 Interior 3 See also 4 References 5 Attribution 6 External links Significance[edit] The building is the earliest remaining federal courthouse in southern Oregon, and an early embodiment of the federal government in that region. The building, which was designed in the office of Oscar Wenderoth - Supervising Architect, U.S. Treasury, was constructed from 1915 to 1916. An identical building was constructed in Pendleton, Oregon, at the same time. Mr. Wenderoth was appointed to his position in 1912 and was responsible for planning many government buildings, especially post offices, before his retirement in 1929. The Medford Federal Building - U.S. Courthouse was designed with many elements of the Georgian Revival style including symmetry, rectangular plan with only minor protrusions, small window panes, arched topped windows (divided as a fan light), classically detailed cornice and balustrade, and red brick exterior. There are also elements of the Second Renaissance Revival style, such as the rusticated first story (performed in brick), a raised first floor with stone base, the lack of front door ornamentation, second level door height casement windows, and wrought iron window ornamentation. These elements give the overall composition a sense of larger scale that is more befitting a federal building. The Oregon State Historic Preservation Office classifies the building as American Renaissance Revival.[4] The courthouse played an important role in the development and growth of Medford. In the early 1880s the Oregon and California Railroad, which was setting tracks south from Portland, began making surveys in southern Oregon. By the fall of 1883 trains were running into Grants Pass. Jacksonville, the county seat and the most important town in this portion of the state, was naturally supposed to be the next station on the railroad. The railroad asked Jacksonville for a $25,000 bonus (reportedly to compensate for the difficulties in passing over the Applegate Ridge of mountains), but the city refused. The Oregon and California railroad subsequently rerouted the railroad through the center of the Rogue River Valley where it proceeded to start a new town. Medford was named after the hometown of the railroad engineer, David Loring of Medford, Massachusetts. Land for the town site and railroad purposes was donated to the Railroad by local landowners, C.C. Beekman, C. Mingus, C.W. Brobeck and Ira J. Phipps, and on December 20, 1883, the town was founded. Due to the rail stop in the center of the rich agricultural/orchard producing Rogue River Valley, the town grew rapidly and by 1890 Medford housed 1,791 residents. (The 1990 population of Medford was 49,900, while Jacksonville was 2,005). By 1910, the monthly postal receipts had increased from the initial $2–$3 to over $2,000. On October 2, 1910, the Medford Daily Tribune reported that "No better criterion of city's growth can be named than its postal receipts." That same year congress had appropriated $110,000 for a new U.S. Post Office and Courthouse. The building was to replace the previous temporary postal facilities (three prior locations) and to provide a U.S. District Court presence in a high-quality, non-combustible structure. City residents were so enthused by the prospect of the new structure that many offered potential sites. The chosen lot at the corner of Sixth and Holly, only three blocks from the railroad depot, was chosen. The land, which was donated by Bert and May Anderson and W.C. and Flossie Green, was formally dedicated on March 13, 1911 with a payment of $1.[4] In 1939, the Federal Works Agency, with Louis A. Simon as Supervising Architect and W.G. Noll as Chief Architect, designed a major addition on the north side of the building, and significant interior remodelling for a cost of $230,000. The project provided additional public and workroom facilities for the Post Office at the first floor, consolidated court operations on the second floor, and provided general office space at the third floor. The design included a two-story light-well which retained natural light for the courtroom and (by skylight) the interior of the postal workroom.[4] In 1966, the post office moved to new facilities two blocks south.[5] Since that time, the building has been utilized for court operations and general office space. Medford has recently adopted a comprehensive plan that encourages downtown development. There has been substantial effort to enhance existing buildings and locate new city, county and federal facilities in the core area, which is bordered at the north by the Medford Federal Building - U.S. Courthouse. In addition to being a governmental center for southern Oregon, Medford is also a center for commerce. The population and tourism of the Rogue River Valley, including historic towns of Jacksonville and Ashland, are growing rapidly. The Medford Federal Building - U.S. Courthouse stands as a functioning symbol of prewar pride and optimism.[4] Architecture[edit] The courthouse as it appeared shortly after its construction. The courthouse is an example of Renaissance Revival architecture. Its exterior is primarily brick and granite. Site[edit] The nearly level, undeveloped site was selected from among several offered as donations from the local citizens, in part due to its location a short distance from the railroad station to the east. The site is now located at the north end of Medford's government and business district. The Medford Federal Building - U.S. Courthouse is located on a lot measuring 140.2 feet by 125.25 feet at the northwest corner of West Sixth Street and North Holly Street. A setback of approximately twenty feet from the two streets (south and east sides) allowed for wide sidewalks with maple street trees, and grass next to the building. The north portion of the site was originally used for mail loading and had a hitching rail for the general public, while the west portion had an access drive. Both were constructed with macadam paving and had concrete curbs. The remaining portions of the site were landscaped with planting beds and seeded grass areas separated by concrete curbing. From the surrounding concrete sidewalks the building was elevated four to five feet to the first floor level. The primary entrance on the center of the south facade was approached via a light-colored raised granite platform which led to the ceremonial granite entry steps, all designed in the classical manner.[4] Exterior[edit] The facades of the building were designed with elements of both the Georgian Revival, and Second Renaissance Revival styles which were popular at the beginning of the twentieth century. The front (south side) has the most interesting mix of elements. The symmetrical elevation is organized around five central bays which are defined by single Doric style pilasters at the interior bays and paired pilasters at the ends. The central portion is then flanked on each end by narrow bays that are only slightly recessed. The two-story pilasters rise from a buff-colored sandstone belt course at the second floor line. The pilasters support a sandstone string course, cornice, and parapet. Originally the parapet had a balustrade in portions aligning with the five bays. The first story, which is detailed in red brick and follows the organization above, is elevated and defined by a sandstone water table course. (Note: This is an interesting design that combines a Renaissance style rustication, which was normally performed in stone, with the red brick of the Georgian Revival style). There are arched openings in the rusticated brick at the five central bays. A voussoir (in the rusticated brick) is detailed at each of these first story openings by individually cut radiating bricks. There originally were paired entry doors with an arched light above at the center three openings. Each of the outer two openings were at one time filled with a three-piece arched top wood casement windows. Each of these were later converted back to doors matching the center pair. At the five central arch openings on the second story, there are Renaissance style wood and glass paired doors with operable transoms. The doors are enclosed with black, wrought iron balcony railings. The arch of the opening is treated as a tympanum and has a bas-relief garlanded sandstone ornament. The third story openings are simplified, rectangular, and have paired casement windows. All of the doors and windows featured multiple light configurations. Four large, ornamental iron, wall mounted fixtures light the entry.[4] Essentially rectangular, the well proportioned original building measured 90.0 feet wide by 57.5 feet deep in plan. The original treatment on the two identical end elevations is restrained compared to the front. The horizontal string courses, brick rustication, cornice and parapet detailing continues, but the pilasters and arched openings are omitted in favor of four evenly spaced rectangular openings in a flat wall, (the end walls of the 1939 addition are recessed from the original.) The original rear (now light-well) elevation reflected the organization of the front and also its interior functions. The central portion of the facade was defined by symmetrically flanking narrow bays that were slightly recessed. The first story had five large glazed rectangular openings in the rusticated brick which provided north light to the postal workroom. A protruding mail vestibule/loading dock occupied the center bay. At the second story, there were three large arched glazed openings with fan lights providing light to the courtroom. These were flanked by tall rectangular openings with circular attic windows directly above. Due to the courtroom height, the third story windows were only located at the flanking bays. Stone, brick, and balcony detailing continued to the rear elevation. Similar to the end elevations, the pilasters were omitted from the north facade.[4] The original construction used common brick exterior walls faced with buff-colored sandstone above, and light-colored granite at and below grade, and red rough faced finish brick. The walls rested on a reinforced concrete foundation. The interior structure was steel frame that was fire-proofed with concrete. Floors were reinforced concrete slabs. Hollow clay tile was used for furring and interior partitions and was typically plastered.[4] The 1940 addition extended the building 38.0 feet to the north. This required that the parking and loading functions be relocated to the west portion of the site. The design duplicated the original materials and most of the detailing. The new side elevations are recessed eighteen inches so that the massing of the original building is distinct. The window openings are dimensioned similar to the originals and are likewise equally spaced. The sash, however, are double hung types at all three levels. Transoms were retained at the first and second levels. The new parapet was designed to be solid stone, unlike the original which had balustraded portions. A new loading platform was constructed on the north end of the west elevation. The two pairs of loading doors were recessed and were protected from rain by a marquee. The dock also had an employee entrance. The north elevation was redesigned along the lines of the side elevations with five equally spaced window openings that utilized metal sash. The use of two outer flanking openings was retained from the original composition. At the center of the first level, three large rectangular windows provided the postal workroom with day lighting. The interior boiler chimney was relocated to the north elevation. A new fire escape, basement stairway, and area-way for the new swing room were also constructed on the north elevation. The original east, west, and south elevations were left intact with exception of the entry approach. The original ceremonial steps were replaced by dual side stairs leading to a common entry landing. The new granite stair was enclosed with wrought iron railings. The roof mounted flagpole was also relocated to the ground at this time. The addition retained much of the original north elevation by creating a new light-well on the center third, and by incorporating the remaining wall within the new construction. (Portions of the original cornice are visible from the attic.) A new concrete block (with cement plaster exterior finish) rooftop penthouse over the main stair replaced the 1916 structure at this time, and the low sloped, built-up roof construction was continued onto the addition.[4] There have not been extensive changes to the exterior of the building since the 1940 addition. Notable alterations include the replacement of the two outer entry doors with double hung windows (and later reversal); revisions to the wall at the loading dock and a new ramp; removal of the fire escape; site paving and planting changes; and the removal of the original parapet balustrade, which was replaced with solid stone panels similar to the 1940 addition. The open stone balustrade was later restored. A west side window of the lobby has been replaced with a fully lited door that is reached by an accessible lift concealed in what was formerly a light-well to a basement window.[4] An essential element to the building's facade and integrity is its (almost complete) set of original functioning wood windows (which were recently abated). Note that windows on the north side of the building have steel frames for the wood sash units.[4] Interior[edit] When the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse first opened, it provided space primarily for just those two operations. The post office occupied the first floor with the public lobby oriented east to west all along the south wall, and with the workroom to the north of the lobby. The money registry was located at the east end of the lobby, the stair wrapping around the elevator cage was at the west end. There was a short lobby extension from the stair northward to provide additional postal windows and give access to the postmaster's office at the northwest corner of the floor. A vault was placed at each end of the floor, one for the money registry and one for the postmaster. There was also a single occupancy toilet at each end of the floor. The mailing vestibule occupied the center position of the postal workroom's north wall. Although it was a construction alternate, the lobby was finished with light colored terrazzo with marble divisions and borders at the floor and wall base. The walls had stained wood wainscoting, postal windows, grills, and door casings with painted plaster above. The interior entry vestibule (center door pair only) was constructed of stained wood and glass and had two wood and glass doors. The ceiling of the lobby had ornamental plaster crown mouldings. The main stairway was constructed with grey marble treads and iron railings, stringers and risers. The original traction elevator had a steel grill enclosure and metal hoist way entrance doors with wire glass relights. The postal lobby finishes were duplicated on the second and third floor lobbies (also a construction alternate) except for the ornamental ceiling plaster. Upper lobbies were centered axially on the stair and elevator which allowed a row of offices along the south wall. The courtroom space occupied the north side of the lobby and extended through the third floor. This courtroom was finished modestly with wall coverings, smooth painted plaster, and stained wood mouldings and furnishings. A construction alternate for the courtroom was designed and shown on the bid drawings, but not built. That design was built at the federal courthouse in Pendleton, Oregon, a very similar building that was constructed concurrently. Office areas on the upper two levels typically were finished with wood floors, moulded wood base, chair rail and casings, three panel wood doors, and smooth painted plaster walls and ceilings. The stained wood corridor doors were typically half-light (art glass) over two panels and had transoms.[4] The 1940 extension and remodeling substantially reconfigured the interior, but for the most part used matching details and materials. The axially designed lobbies were changed to a 'C' shape to provide access to the additional area. On the first floor, the larger lobby surrounded the old postal workroom on three sides. A new postal window wall replaced the original window and screen wall. New workroom space filled the addition. On the second and third floors, new corridors extended northward to the new office and judicial areas. The east corridor led to a new fire escape. A small light-well was created at the upper levels to preserve natural lighting for the courtroom through its three large windows and to the postal workroom below was lit through skylights. The smaller windows at the courtroom were converted to passageways for judges and witnesses. The original vaults and toilet rooms were removed and new ones constructed. The stairway was extended to the roof and included a new penthouse. Woodwork, doors, and stone matched the 1916 construction. The new terrazzo, which replaced the original at the lobby and was used for the corridor extensions on the upper floors, was a substantially different mix design. A darker and redder matrix of Tennessee Medium Pink, and Chesapeake Green marble was used. Existing wood floors were covered with linoleum. The new restrooms were finished with ceramic mosaic tile floors, glazed tile wainscot, new plumbing fixtures, and painted metal partitions.[4] Since the 1940 remodel there have been various alterations. An extensive remodeling was in undertaken in 1965 shortly after the post office left the building. At that time the first floor lobby was removed, the stair enclosed, and the postal workroom converted to office space. Upper level offices were also remodeled. Other recent changes include the addition of suspended ceilings, fluorescent lighting, HVAC, an interior exit stair at the northeast corner, elevator modifications. Another significant remodel occurred in 1994 including converting the first floor lobby back to near original location, mechanical and electrical, provision of holding cells and an elevator to the courtroom, and remodeling of judges chambers.[4] See also[edit] National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Oregon References[edit] ^ a b c d e f Bak, Kristine (December 12, 1978), National Register of Historic Places Inventory — Nomination Form: United States Post Office and Court House, Medford, Oregon (PDF), retrieved March 24, 2013. ^ Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, Oregon Historic Sites Database, retrieved March 24, 2013 ^ S.1875 -- To designate the United States courthouse in Medford, Oregon, as the 'James A.

Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 3 After baseball 4 Career statistics 5 References 6 External Links Early life[edit] Joan was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Both her father and grandfather played a lot of ball. So she played with them. She had a bat and a ball and they had flat gloves and she remembers playing as a child. She first heard about the league when her mother took her a ball game when she was in 5th or 6th grade for the Kenosha Comets. She loved it and immediately wished to play for the team. Her mother was strictly against this, and she refused to go to any more of the games. Holderness eventually began watching them practice, and met several ball players, who would play catch with her. In 1947, at the age of 14, she was asked if she wanted to be Kenosha's batgirl. She accepted, received her uniform, and became the batgirl during the summer. A year later, the AAGPBL began using farm teams, and Holderness was given permission to play once a week. She played shortstop for that year, and moved up to the highest level of the league the next year. Career[edit] In 1949, Joan was invited to go to Spring training in Indiana. It was there she got a contract which her father signed as she was only 16 (under age). But her mom wouldn't let her travel so half the year she didn't do much. But she was very well-liked and by 1950, she played more, sometimes right-field. She had a good arm and was asked to join the Grand Rapid Chicks which was in town playing against Kenosha. Throughout her baseball career, Joan played for the Kenosha Comets (1949-1950), the Grand Rapids Chicks (1950-1951), and the Battle Creek Belles (1951). She was a versatile player, playing outfield, shortstop, and utility infield. After baseball[edit] Following her time with the league, Joan's hobbies included fishing and bowling. In 1963, she joined the National Ladies Professional Bowling Association. In 1981, she was inducted into the Florida Women's Bowling Association Hall of Fame. A year later, she was inducted into the St. Petersburg, Florida Women's Hall of Fame and 2 years later, the Clearwater, Florida Women's Hall of Fame. Holderness died on July 6th, 2017, in Crossville, TN.[1] Career statistics[edit] Year G AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI SB BB SO AVG 1949 34 48 2 8 0 0 0 8 1 2 8 .167 1950 62 175 10 26 1 1 0 10 3 20 10 .149 1951 23 61 1 9 1 0 0 10 0 8 3 .148 References[edit] ^ "Joan, Holderness, Death, Obituary". www.aagpbl.org.

The state was then divided into several school districts.[2] District number 22 (called the Setzer School District) covered Rowan County and was based in the Setzer School, a one-room log school built in 1840s just east of China Grove.[3] The first public schools in Rowan were established in 1847. Several citizens interested in education met and formed the Board of Superintendents of Common Schools of Rowan County on May 8, 1847. They elected Hamilton C. Jones as their first chairman. That year, they worked to hire teachers, choose/elect superintendents and divide the county into 47 school districts.[4] Rowan County public schools[edit] Educational progress happened more rapidly in the city of Salisbury than in the rest of the county. While Salisbury's schools grew, schools in the rest of Rowan County lagged far behind. After the city school system split off, the difference became more noticeable as a report from John H. Cook from the North Carolina College for Women (now, University of North Carolina at Greensboro) around 1924 called the county's schools the worst in North Carolina. At the time, the county only had 36 schools many of which were only one or two room buildings. Cook devised a plan for school improvement and new school construction which the county commissioners and the citizens promptly adopted in 1924. Soon thereafter, a school construction boom created 18 schools with at least eight rooms each.[5] Racial desegregation became a tough issue for many in the Rowan County Schools system. The separate Black schools were phased out, but many opposed to racial integration still put up a fight. This was aggravated by a strong Klan presence in the area. Notable incidents included 12 people arrested in 1967, including Rowan County's Registrar of Deeds, for threats, shootings, and bombings;[6][7] as well as student protests over the playing of the song "Dixie" at school football games at integrated South Rowan High School. .[8][9] Salisbury city schools[edit] When the Board of Superintendents set up the county school districts, the town of Salisbury fell into district 27. In 1847, monies apportioned to operate the school in the district totaled $221. The first teachers of the district were Susan Giles and Eleanor Fulton.[4] This Salisbury Graded School District was centered on the school and offices on Ellis Street. Later the area would become known as the Ellis Street Graded School District. The Salisbury Graded School had grown much from its origins and the city build a high school separate from the other grades in 1904. This was the second high school built in North Carolina after Wilmington.[5] The former J. C. Price High School Prior to the establishment of Salisbury City Schools, the school district fell under control of the county school system. The district was managed jointly by the City of Salisbury and the district's Board of Trustees. Salisbury City Schools brgan as a separate system on March 3, 1921, when the North Carolina General Assembly adopted the law that allowed a separate Board of Education to run the system.[4] Several schools were built over next few years, including the Wiley School, Boyden High School and Price High School. The Calvin H. Wiley School, built 1916–18, was expanded in 1921. It was used as a school building until 1983 and is now on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).[10] Another prominent school built in 1926, was Boyden High School, named for Archibald Henderson Boyden, an educator who was then Mayor of Salisbury.[11] J.C. Price High School was an African American school that served students in the system from 1932 until 1969 when it was integrated into Boyden High School, which then became Salisbury High School in 1970. The Boyden High School site[12] and the Price High School site are also on the NRHP.[13] Merger[edit] The current Rowan-Salisbury School System was formed in 1989 by the merger of Rowan County Schools and Salisbury City Schools.[14] The process leading up to the merger was difficult and almost not approved several times. Declining enrollment in the city and county systems (especially the city system) and a general move towards "white flight" from the more urban and minority-heavy city schools had prompted discussions of merging the systems. At issue in the merger talks primarily was redistricting and racial balance in the schools. However, the separate city and county school boards approved a merger plan on October 16, 1987. This was soon approved by the Rowan County Commission and the State Board of Education.[15] Adding to the stresses of the merger process, a red measles outbreak in 1989 limited school activities and athletics in Rowan and Cabarrus counties for several weeks.[16][17] Since the merger, the system has become the second-largest employer in Rowan County.[18] In 2006, the school board made headlines when students at South Rowan High School started up a gay–straight alliance club at their school. In response to public complaint, led by Flip Benham of Operation Save America[19] from neighboring Cabarrus county, the Board of Education adopted a policy banning "sex-based student clubs" at all schools in the system. The combined system handled around 16,000 students in 1990.[20] Even decades after the merger consolidated the systems, the school district has no central office, instead spreading administrative tasks over five office locations across Rowan County.[14] The move towards a central office for the system has been contentious in the county. Disagreements between the county commission and the school board have delayed finalizing plans and construction.[21] The Salisbury City Council even agreed to help fund construction of a central office.[22] Student demographics[edit] For the 2010–2011 school year, Rowan-Salisbury Schools had a population of 20,460 students and 1,400.69 teachers on a (FTE) basis. This created a student-teacher ratio of 14.61:1.[1] The same year, out of the total student population, the gender ratio was 51% male to 49% female. The demographic group makeup was: White, 65%; Black, 19%; Hispanic, 12%; Asian/Pacific Islander, 1%; and American Indian, 0% (two or more races, 2%).[23] For the same school year, 60.51% of the students received free and reduced-cost lunches.[24] In 2012, nearly 70% of Rowan-Salisbury School System elementary students receive free or reduced lunches, according to Amy Goodnight, executive director of Food for Thought.[25] Governance and funding[edit] Ellis St. Administrative Building in Salisbury, NC. The primary governing body of the Rowan-Salisbury School System follows a council–manager government format with a seven-member Board of Education appointing a Superintendent to run the day-to-day operations of the system. The system resides in the North Carolina State Board of Education's Seventh District.[26] Board of education[edit] The seven-member Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education generally meets on the fourth Monday of each month. The members are chosen in non-partisan elections by the whole county, but must come from one of the six high school districts or the special area district. The board serves four-year, staggered terms with elections every two years. Its current members are: Josh Wagner (Chairperson), East area; Dean Hunter (Vice-Chairperson), South area; Chuck Hughes, Salisbury area; Travis Allen, West area; Susan Cox, Southeast area; W. Jean Kennedy, Special area; and Richard Miller, North area.[27] In response to HB2,[clarification needed] the Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education ruled on May 10, 2016 that students can carry pepper spray and mace. Board member Chuck Hughes said, "Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in."[28] Superintendent[edit] The district has had five superintendents since the merger. Don Martin was chosen from outside the county to lead the newly merged school district. He served from 1989 until leaving in 1994 to lead the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools.[29][30] Joe McCann, who had previously worked for the county school system before the merger was chosen as the next superintendent, serving from 1995 until 2000.[31] Then, Wiley Doby served as the district leader 2001–2006.[32] Dr.Judy Grissom was chosen to replace Wiley Doby as superintendent when his contract expired on April 1, 2006. A native of Rowan County, Grissom once worked for the school system and had been associate superintendent for the Alamance-Burlington School System.[33] In 2011, Grissom won Superintendent of the Year for the southwest region and was a finalist for the statewide award.[34] Grissom provided the school district which the leadership that was responsible for the school district winning more state and national awards, especially in the areas of technology and curriculum innovation. Her tenure as Superintendent resulted in more national and state achieve awards than any of the district's superintendents. The superintendent leading the Rowan-Salisbury School System is now Dr. Lynn Moody. She had been superintendent of Rock Hill Schools system. Moody was chosen to replace Judy Grissom as superintendent starting in October, 2013.[35] As Rowan-Salisbury's Superintendent, Moody leads the district of approximately 20,000 students and 3,000 employees in 35 schools and five central office locations. The focus for 2014-2017, as defined in the district's Strategic Plan, is Literacy and Student Engagement through problem-based learning, digital conversion and professional learning communities. Classrooms are transforming to increase rigor and engagement through CCRP: Connected-Learning, Collaboration, Relevancy, and Personalization. During the 2014-15 school year, Rowan-Salisbury was moved to a one-to-one digital conversion. Teachers and high school students received MacBook Air laptops, while students in grades 3-8 received iPads. This teaching and learning tool has changed the culture of the community and its schools. Funding[edit] Public school districts in North Carolina do not have their own taxation authority; they are fiscally dependent on the State and their respective county Board of Commissioners. The county Boards of Commissioners vote on funding levels proposed by the school system.[36] Prior to the merger of the city and county systems, spending per-pupil differed greatly between the city and county schools. The City of Salisbury supplemented the spending more than the County of Rowan did. Spending per-pupil equalized to be greater than what the Rowan County Public Schools public schools spent previously, but a report in 2005 showed that spending to be consistently below the state average.[37] The Blanche & Julian Robertson Family Foundation has awarded several grants Rowan-Salisbury Schools.[38] Member schools[edit] The Rowan-Salisbury School System has 35 schools ranging from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade, including an early college high school. Those 35 schools are separated into 8 high schools, 7 middle schools and 20 elementary schools.[39] The system's high schools often hold their graduation ceremonies at Catawba College's Keppel Auditorium.[40] High schools[edit] East Rowan High School (Mustangs) – Granite Quarry Henderson Independent High School (Eagles) – Salisbury Jesse C. Carson High School (Cougars) – China Grove North Rowan High School (Cavaliers) – Spencer Rowan County Early College (Timberwolves) – Salisbury Salisbury High School (Hornets) – Salisbury South Rowan High School (Raiders) – China Grove West Rowan High School (Falcons) – Mount Ulla Middle schools[edit] There are seven middle schools in the system. Knox Middle School has been chosen to become the district's first STEM middle school.[41] China Grove Middle School (Red Devils) – China Grove Corriher-Lipe Middle School (Yellow Jackets) – Landis Erwin Middle School (Eagles) – Granite Quarry Knox Middle School (Trojans) – Salisbury North Rowan Middle School (Mavericks) – Spencer Southeast Middle School (Patriots) – Salisbury West Rowan Middle School (Bulldogs) – Cleveland Elementary schools[edit] Overton Elementary School Bostian Elementary School (Bulldogs) – China Grove China Grove Elementary School (Cardinals) – China Grove Enochville Elementary School (Wise Owls) – Enochville Faith Elementary School (Firecrackers) – Faith Granite Quarry Elementary School (Dragons) – Granite Quarry Hanford-Dole Elementary School (Bobcats) – Salisbury Hurley Elementary School (All Stars) – Salisbury Isenberg Elementary School (Investigators) – Salisbury Knollwood Elementary School (Knights) – Salisbury Koontz Elementary School (Panthers) – Salisbury Landis Elementary School (Mini Jackets) – Landis Millbridge Elementary School (Musketeers) – China Grove Morgan Elementary School (Broncos) – Gold Hill Mount Ulla Elementary School (Monarchs) – Mount Ulla North Rowan Elementary School (Steamers) – Spencer Overton Elementary School (Explorers) – Salisbury Rockwell Elementary School (Roadrunners) – Rockwell Shive Elementary School (Stingers) – Rockwell West Rowan Elementary School (Wildcats) - Cleveland Horizons Unlimited[edit] The school system also manages Horizons Unlimited, a facility behind Knox Middle School that includes the 1842 Setzer School building, a 32-acre wetland preserve, a planetarium, several aquaria, a rainforest habitat, and several Native American artifacts. It oversees the largest WILD Environmental Education Site in North Carolina with a 600-acre research area. The structure itself houses nearly 20,000 square feet of classroom and exhibit space.[42][43][44] Horizons hosts the North Carolina Region 6A Science and Engineering Fair[45] and is a member of the Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science (COPUS).[46] Athletics[edit] Athletic departments for the district schools are members of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association. They compete in various sports over three different conferences. North Rowan is a 1A school in the Yadkin Valley Conference. Salisbury High is a 2A school in the Central Carolina Conference. Carson, East, South, and West Rowan are all 3A schools in the North Piedmont Conference. Rowan County Early College and Henderson Independent do not have athletic teams.[47] Prior to 2008, North Rowan was a 2A school in the Central Carolina Conference, but when enrollment at the school decreased, the NCHSAA dropped the school to 1A status and moved them to another conference.[48] In baseball, Salisbury High won one 3A state championship in 1955. East Rowan won two 3A state titles in 1995 and 2010.[49] Football has seen more successes with Salisbury winning 3A state titles in 1955 and 1957 as well as a 2-AA title in 2010. West Rowan won three straight 3A state championships from 2008 to 2010,[50] which included two straight undefeated seasons with a 46-game winning streak.[51][52] J. C. Price High School won the Black schools athletic association (the North Carolina High School Athletic Conference) state AA championship in 1952.[53] Achievements and awards[edit] West Rowan High School The Rowan-Salisbury School System has had two schools listed as Blue Ribbon Schools: West Rowan High School (1990–91) and China Grove Elementary School (1989–90).[54] Under the direction of former superintendent Dr. Judy Grissom and Executive Director of Technology, Phil Hardin, the system was ranked sixth nationally in 2013 in the Large Student Population District category of the Center for Digital Education's Digital School Districts Survey. The ranking showed the district's "use of technology to govern the district, communicate with students, parents and the community and to improve district operations".[55] The school district was ranked ninth nationally in 2012 in the Large Student Population District category of the Center for Digital Education's Digital School Districts Survey.[56] In 2012, the 1:1 mobile device program that was instituted at North Rowan High School by Superintendent, Dr. Judy Grissom, and Executive Director of Technology, Phil Hardin was recognized with the North Carolina School Board Association's overall grand prize in the Award of Excellence In Educational Programs. This 1:1 program provided North Rowan High School students 24/7 access to mobile devices and was the one of the first 1:1 high programs in the state of North Carolina. The program also provided wireless access for students on their buses.[57] In 2013, the International Society for Technology in Education, ISTE, presented the Superintendent, Dr. Judy Grissom and Executive Director of Technology, Phil Hardin, with the Sylvia Charp Award for Innovation in District Technology.[58] In 2012, Executive Director of Technology, Phil Hardin, was awarded 2012 Outstanding Leader Award through the North Carolina Technology In Education Society and Superintendent, Dr. Judy Grissom, was presented the "2012 Making IT (Instructional Technology) Happen Award.[59] Two employees of the school district have won the North Carolina School Psychology Association Practitioner of the Year Award: Ann Hammonds Long in 1993 and Shirley Bowles in 2000.[60] Rowan-Salisbury School System has had two teachers recognized as a North Carolina Department of Public Instruction Teacher of the Year: Cynthia B. Zeger-Ostherhus from Salisbury City Schools for 1987–88 and Sandra Davis Rogers from Rowan County Schools for 1989–90. None have won since the merger.[61] In 2005, the system's technology director, Phil Hardin received the North Carolina Technology Educator Award in the administrator category from the state Department of Public Instruction.[62] Also, Theresa Pierce, from Horizons Unlimited, was named the North Carolina Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History Teacher of the Year in 2009.[63][64] See also[edit] Kannapolis City Schools also serves some residents of Rowan County.

This generated the affectionate nickname "The Peoples' Six-pack".[3] Goals[edit] # Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition 1. 23 February 2008 Chongqing Olympic Sports Center, Chongqing, China China PR 1–0 1–3 2008 East Asian Football Championship 2. 27 August 2009 World Games Stadium, Kaohsiung, Taiwan Chinese Taipei 2–1 2–1 2010 East Asian Football Championship 3. 15 June 2010 Ellis Park Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa Brazil 1–2 1–2 2010 FIFA World Cup References[edit] ^ Ji Yun-Nam – FIFA competition record ^ Stevenson, Jonathan (2010-06-15).

It was a variation on the daiquiri, made using overproof Guyanese and Cuban rums and small amounts of curacao, creme de cacao, and sweet vermouth for additional flavor.

In 1952 it was moved to the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont. It now serves as an exhibit building on the museum grounds.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Architecture 3 References 4 External links History[edit] The building was originally erected by the Charlotte Methodist Church in 1840, after their original wooden structure was destroyed in a fire in 1837. By 1899 it had ceased to function as a church and was taken over by a group of thirteen young women who had formed an amateur theatrical group and used the building as a playhouse.[2] In 1902, the group incorporated as the Breezy Point Library Association and bought the building to serve as the town library. Charles W. Henry, Vermont's foremost painted theater curtain artist, often painted backdrops for the association's productions. After a windstorm damaged the building in 1950, the association voted to sell it to the Shelburne Museum so that it could be preserved.[3] In 1952, the Shelburne Museum dismantled the building and moved it to its grounds, finding replacements for missing or damaged elements, including the belfry, pews, and pulpit, in an abandoned church in Milton, Vermont.[1] The interior plaster walls were painted in tones of white and grey to resemble paneled woodwork (see Trompe-l'œil).[3] Architecture[edit] The structure reflects the stylistic tendencies established in the last decade of the 18th century when the church plan became the standard on which meeting houses were designed. The church plan refers to a rectangular structure with a pitched roof and incorporated bell tower, with the entrance located along the structure's short axis and the pulpit positioned opposite. Since the church plan and the word "church" connoted Anglicanism, Puritan communities used the term "meeting house" to refer to the building they used for both secular and religious meetings.[1] Puritans, and later Congregationalists, traditionally constructed their meeting houses on a square or rectangular plan with hipped roofs, a separate bell tower, and the entrance and pulpit situated on the long sides of the building. By the late eighteenth century, as communities began to distinguish between meeting houses and churches, Protestant communities adopted both the title "church" and the associated plan in designing their religious buildings.[1] The Meeting House's triangular pediment, accented with cornice moldings, reflects the pervasiveness of Greek Revival architecture in the mid-nineteenth century. The lack of other adornment, typical of the Greek Revival style, lent itself well to New England Protestant architecture.[3] References[edit] ^ a b c d Shelburne Museum. 1993.

Annapurnamma Manthena Venkata Raju (1904–1968) was an Indian politician and social worker from Manthenavaripalem, Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh. He participated in the non-violent resistance against the British rule in India. Freedom Fighter[edit] In 1921, at the age of 17, Sri Manthena Venkata Raju, walked out of the National College and gave up education to participate in the Freedom Struggle of India. Since that year, he participated in several Campaigns and Satyagraha movements until India achieved Independence. He was jailed on several occasions during his participation in the Freedom Struggle. He occupied several important positions in the Andhra Congress party during this period. He served as Sceretary and President of the Guntur District Congress and was the General Secretary of the Andhra Congress Party. Among the notable leaders of Andhra Pradesh, Sri Kasu Brahmananda Reddy, Sri Alapati Venkataramaiah and Sri Venigalla Satyanarayana were all introduced to politics by Sri Manthena Venkata Raju. In 1938, Sri Manthena Venkata Raju conducted the All India Workshop for Politics in the village of Manthenavaripalem and helped educate several leaders in the importance of politics and governance. Several leaders with Socialist-Communist lenience, within the Congress, also participated in the Workshop. Social Worker[edit] Sri Manthena Venkata Raju participated in several Social causes. In 1934, he participated in a campaign to allow Harijans into temples. He helped dig many wells to provide drinking water to several villages and also encouraged people from all castes to inter mix socially. He conducted widow marriages in the village of Karlapalem and also conducted several inter-caste marriages during his lifetime. Political Leader[edit] He entered the State Assembly in 1946, and was a member until 1962, barring a gap of two years. During his tenure in the State Assembly, he assumed a very important role in State Politics. During those times, Chief Ministers like, Sri Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, Sri Gopal Reddy and Sri Sanjeevayya, were among those who sought the blessings of Sri Manthena Venkata Raju. He always professed the principal of retirement from active politics after a certain age, like in any other salaried job; in accordance with this principle, he retired from Politics at the age of 58, in the year 1962. He believed in strong principles and was among those who lived by example. Even without having riches or the caste equation working to his advantage, Sri Manthena Venkata Raju, established his presence in the political arena of the State of Andhra Pradesh through his disinterest in positions and his commitment to social work. The Sri Manthena Venkata Raju Foundation was established by Champati Vijaya Ramaraju, ex-MLA of Bapatla, in his memory. The foundation does Social Services in Bapatla constituency and honors the accomplished 'sons and daughters' of the region.

He was educated in his native city where G. Mazzatinti introduced him to librarianship. He then studied at the Faculty of Letters in the University of Bologna, graduating in 1907.[1] Immediately after graduating, he joined a group of intellectuals associated with the journal La Romagna nella storia, nella letteratura e nelle arti, becoming its editor in 1911. He took a special interest in the social and economic history of the region, publishing accounts of developments from the 16th to the 18th centuries. At the same time, he took up teaching, first at the high school in Rimini, then at Alatri (1909) and Chieri (1912). During the First World War, he enlisted in the artillery until April 1919 when he was discharged with the rank of captain.[1] Business career[edit] Immediately after the war he moved to Milan where he gave up teaching in favour of a business career, becoming the Italian agent for American chemicals producers including Dupont de Nemours and founding his own company, Dott. Aldo Garzanti Coloranti et Prodotti Chimici, a distribution outlet supplying the textile and leather industries. As a result of his success, in 1921 he was able to open his own manufacturing company, SADAF, which produced dyes and chemicals for soaking and tanning hides and leathers. In 1932, he widened his interests, opening MIRET specializing in lace and silk. The following year he created a model agricultural enterprise in Suvignano, Tuscany but above all, in 1936, he acquired the Treves publishing company which was in difficulty. Created in 1861 by Emilio Treves, Fratelli Treves Editori had been a leading publisher not only in Lombardy but throughout Italy. After changing its name to Casa Editrice Garzanti, he received support from Benito Mussolini which brought him lucrative commissions from the library authorities, making it one of the top publishing companies in Italy.[1][2] The company suffered during the Second World War when the old Treves printing plant was bombed but Garzanti was successful in rebuilding modern facilities within a year, winning the Roncoroni prize for rapid redevelopment. In 1952, suffering from poor health, he retired as managing director of the company but remained chairman of the board.[1] Later life[edit] In later life, Garzanti devoted his efforts mainly to philanthropic activities, contributing to the restoration of the castle Rocca Caterina Sforza in Forlì and assisting artists through the Fondazione Livio e Maria Garzanti. In 1954, he financed the Italian expedition which successfully climbed K2. He died in 1961 at the age of 78.[1] Family[edit] In 1920, Garzanti married Maria Ravasi who gave birth to their son Livio in 1921. Livio later took over the family publishing business.[3] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f "Garzanti, Aldo" (in Italian). Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 52. 1999.

It stands next to the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, which serves the monastic community. The old monastic buildings currently serves as the headquarters of the Cini Foundation. Contents 1 History of the monastery 1.1 Foundation 1.2 Prestige 1.3 The decline 2 Revival 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History of the monastery[edit] Foundation[edit] The monastery was founded in AD 982 following the donation of the island by the Doge Tribuno Memmo in response to a request by the Blessed John Morosini, O.S.B., who wished to establish a monastery there, and who then became the first abbot. Among the first monks of the community which developed there was St. Gerard of Csanád (Hungarian: Szent Gellért) (980-1046), a bishop and martyr who helped establish Christianity in Hungary. He was murdered in Budapest—on the hill which now bears his name—in the course of a pagan insurrection against the Venetian king then ruling the Hungarians. Prestige[edit] San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk, Claude Monet, 1908–1912 Over the centuries the monastery became a theological, cultural and artistic center of primary importance in Europe. The monks had considerable autonomy and close links with Florence and Padua, and thus it became also a favoured location for foreign dignitaries to stay while in the city. In 1177 Pope Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa met here. In 1223 a violent earthquake destroyed the monastery. In 1433 Cosimo de' Medici, when exiled from Florence, took refuge here. Between 1560 and 1562 Andrea Palladio built a new refectory for which Paolo Veronese painted the massive The Wedding Feast at Cana which was displayed there. In 1566 began the construction of the new church by Palladio, who later designed also the "Palladian" cloister. Between 1641 and 1680 Baldassarre Longhena designed the new library, the grand staircase, the monastery facade, the novitiate, the infirmary and the guest quarters. After the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, the monastery was deprived of its most precious books and works of art. Napoleon sent The Wedding Feast at Cana to Paris, and at present it is displayed in the Louvre museum. It is now possible, however, to admire a copy in the refectory which hangs in the place for which the painting was originally created. The monastery was so important that, in 1799, while Rome was occupied by the French Revolutionary Army, the Papal conclave which elected Pope Pius VII was convened there. The cardinals met into the chorum nocturnis (or Night choir), where the remarkable canvas St George slaying the Dragon by Vittore Carpaccio is still displayed. The decline[edit] Nevertheless, in 1806 the monastery was suppressed and the monks expelled; many of the monastery's remaining treasures were sold or stolen. Only a few monks were able to remain to serve in the church, while the monastery itself became a weapons depot. For more than a century it was used as a military garrison, undergoing grave deterioration. Revival[edit] In 1951 the Italian Government granted the monastery to the Cini Foundation, which restored it and revived its cultural heritage. On 29–30 May 1956 the Venice Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the six Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was held in the San Giorgio Monastery to discuss the Spaak Report of the Spaak Committee.

The United Nations estimates that as many as half the 1.5 million population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies. Due to fears that militants would acquire weapons in Egypt, Israeli police went on increased alert.[1] Egypt had closed the Rafah border crossing in June 2007, days before the Hamas took control of Gaza at the end of the Fatah-Hamas conflict;[2][3] The breach followed a blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel beginning in part that same June, with fuel supply reductions in October 2007.[4] A total blockade had begun on 17 January 2008 following a rise in rocket attacks on Israel emanating from Gaza.[1] Although Israel demanded Egypt reseal the border due to security concerns, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered his troops to allow crossings to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, while verifying that the Gazans did not attempt to bring weapons back into Gaza. In five days, Gazans spent some US$250 million in the North Sinai Governorate's capital of Arish alone.[5] The sudden enormous demand there for staple products led to large local price rises and some shortages. On 24 January, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned Israel for the fifteenth time in less than two years, calling the blockade collective punishment.[6] However, the proceedings were boycotted by Israel and the United States. On 27 January, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised that Israel would no longer disrupt the supply of food, medicine and necessary energy into the Gaza Strip.[7] Meanwhile, President Mubarak announced plans to meet separately with representatives of Hamas and Fatah in order to come to a new border control agreement.[7] On 3 February, Gaza's Foreign minister, Mahmoud al-Zahar, announced that Hamas and Egypt would cooperate in controlling the border without Israeli control, "perhaps jointly with Abbas".[8] Abbas' Government said that Egypt had agreed to restore the 2005 border agreement giving Abbas control over the Rafah crossing, but excluding Hamas. Israel, on the other hand resisted Abbas' control of any crossing point.[9] The border was closed—except to travelers returning home—eleven days after the breach.[10] Contents 1 Background 2 Humanitarian crisis 3 Breaching of wall 4 UN reaction 5 Israeli government response 6 Border-control talks 7 Border closure 8 Economic effects 9 International response 10 See also 11 References Background[edit] Egypt had pledged to help control their border with Gaza along the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier subsequent to the Israel's unilateral disengagement plan which ended their 38-year occupation of Gaza in 2005 (q.v. Philadelphi Route).[11] U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice brokered a deal with Israel giving the Palestinian National Authority control over the Rafah Border crossing under the remote video observation of European Union and Israeli monitors (q.v. European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah).[12][13] After Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election in January 2006, an international diplomatic and financial boycott of the new Hamas-led government began.[4] Beginning in June 2006, a series of battles erupted between Palestinian gunmen and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict, which ended in a truce on 26 November. In December 2006, Hamas began fighting to expel Fatah. Hundreds of rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza had continued despite the November truce. In March 2007, the Palestinian Legislative Council established a national unity government, with 83 representatives voting in favor and three against. Government ministers were sworn in by Mahmoud Abbas, the chairman on the Palestinian Authority, in a ceremony held simultaneously in Gaza and Ramallah. In June 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip[14] and removed Fatah officials. Following the Battle of Gaza, the international sanctions were terminated in June 2007 while at the same time a new and more severe blockade of the Gaza Strip was initiated. In response to the violent clashes, President Abbas declared a state of emergency and dissolved the national unity government on 14 June. Hamas gained complete control of the Gaza Strip on 15 June,[15] after forcing out Fatah. The Israeli government closed all check-points along its border with Gaza in response to the violence.[12] Egypt closed its border when fighting between Fatah and Hamas started on 7 June.[3] The European Union monitors ended their oversight at the frontier on 14 June due to security concerns. Egyptian officials said that a decision to reopen Gaza's border would be made in consultation with the European Union and Israel.[3] Hamas seized control of Gaza on 15 June. Humanitarian crisis[edit] Main article: Blockade of the Gaza Strip Beginning in June 2007, Israel limited its exports to Gaza to nine basic materials. Out of 9,000 commodities (including foodstuffs) that were entering Gaza before the 2006 elections, only 20 commodities were to be allowed in.[4] In July 2007, Israeli officials planned to open the border crossing at Rafah to allow stranded Palestinians to return to Gaza but were deterred by Hamas's threats to open fire on the refugees.[16] In October 2007, Israel began limiting fuel supplies to the territory.[4] Ongoing rocket attacks on Israeli civilian population centers, such as Sderot, prompted the Israeli government to declare the Gaza Strip a hostile entity in September 2007,[17] enabling it to further limit exports to Gaza.[17] Hamas responded that Israel had effectively declared war by labeling Gaza as an "enemy entity."[18] In December 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed the need for humanitarian relief in the Palestinian territories.[19] In a statement, the ICRC described the living conditions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as "alarming" and called for Israel to ease restrictions on the movement of goods into Gaza and the West Bank.[19] According to a United Nations study, by January 2008, the economic effects of the blockade had reached a critical threshold.[20] Finally, on 17 January 2008, following a rise in the number of rocket attacks, Israel sealed the border completely.[1] On 20 January, the only power plant in Gaza shut down.[1] The United Nations officials implored Israel to reverse its decision to seal all border crossings with the Gaza Strip, warning that the violence in the region and the lack of crucial supplies for 1.4 million Palestinians was provoking a humanitarian crisis.[21] Israel accused Hamas of "fabricating" the power shortage, pointing out that the power plant in Gaza produces only a minority of the territory's power.[22] Israel stated that the blackout occurred for media purposes and stated that Hamas had timed it themselves.[23] Israel said it was still providing nearly 70 percent of the territory's power directly.[22] Following widespread international concern about an impending humanitarian crisis, and a warning from the United Nations that World Food Programme aid to about 860,000 Gazans could be halted within days because of the blockade,[22] Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak decided to ease restrictions on the flow of goods into Gaza for a day on 22 January,[22] permitting shipments of fuel for Gaza's power plant and cooking oil to enter Gaza.[24] Breaching of wall[edit] Gaza Strip. Rafah is at bottom-left. On 22 January, gunfire erupted after a group of Hamas demonstrators, mostly women, forced open the door of the Rafah Border crossing and fled into Egypt.[25] Overnight on 23 January, gunmen set off a number of explosions along the wall near the crossing. Palestinians packed into cars and donkey carts, crossed the border into Egypt from Gaza on foot, to buy essential goods.[26] Between 200,000 and 700,000 Palestinians crossed over to Egypt and bought items at shops at the Egyptian half of Rafah and the North Sinai Governorate's capital, Arish.[27][28] A Palestinian security guard later told The Times of London that militants had been steadily cutting through the base of the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier with oxyacetylene torches for months.[23][29] While Egypt allowed Palestinians to enter Egypt, it did not let them travel very far; Palestinians were not allowed to travel further than Arish.[30] Egypt said that it would not use force to send back Palestinians.[31] Foreign ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said the border would be closed again when all the Palestinians had returned.[31] Ahmed Yousef, a senior adviser to Gaza's Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, warned that "The next time there is a crisis in the Gaza Strip, Israel will have to face half a million Palestinians who will march toward Erez," a border crossing with Israel, and on to towns left during the 1948 Palestinian exodus.[32][33] Israeli security officials said militants had exploited the breach in the border wall to send armed men into the Sinai to infiltrate Israel across the Sinai-Israel border.[32] The officials said the militants were eager to hit back in response to Israeli attacks in recent weeks and predicted attacks from Sinai within the next two weeks.[32] On 25 January, Egyptian security forces blocked almost all illegal entry points along the border with Gaza to try to stem the flow of Palestinians wanting to leave.[1] Egyptian forces in riot gear erected barbed wire and chain-link fences along the border to prevent more Palestinians from crossing.[34] Palestinians attempted to break through, and several were injured in the resulting clashes. After the repair, Palestinians used a bulldozer to knock over the new fence, creating an opening once more.[34] As the border crossings entered their fifth day, Egyptian border police began stopping Gazans from entering in vehicles and blocked off the road beyond Rafah to Arish.[7] In Rafah there was little left to buy, and it appeared Egypt had decided to restrict the resupply of goods to El Arish and Rafah in order to peacefully end the crossings and reestablish control over the border.[7] On 28 January, Egyptian security forces and Hamas militants strung barbed wire across one of the breaches, sealing it off.[35] The Egyptians began repairing one of the two remaining breaches on 29 January.[36] UN reaction[edit] On 24 January, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned Israel for the fifteenth time in less than two years.[6] The Council released a statement calling on Israel to stop its military operations in Gaza and to open the Strip's borders to allow the entry of food, fuel and medicine. It asked the international community to ensure that Israel stop its actions in Gaza, which it referred to as "collective punishment of the Palestinian civilians that leads to disastrous humanitarian and environmental consequences." An official resolution was presented by Syria and Pakistan on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference to the United Nations Security Council but could not be agreed upon.[24] Thirty nations voted in favor of the resolution, one (Canada) voted against the resolution, 15 countries abstained, and one (Gabon) was absent.[6][24] Both Israel and the United States boycotted the proceedings, which ended with a call for Israel to lift its siege of Gaza but made no mention of the Palestinian rocket attacks on communities in the western Negev.[6] Israeli government response[edit] Israel demanded Egypt reseal the border and launched air strikes against the Gazan half of Rafah overnight on 24 January, killing Mohammed Abu Harb, the commander of Hamas's military there.[1] At a court hearing on 27 January, the Israeli government promised to resume supplies of fuel, but not at normal levels, for another week.[37] Later that day, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised that Israel would no longer disrupt the supply of food, medicine and necessary energy into the Gaza Strip.[7] Israel then launched additional air strikes targeting the Gazan military in Rafah, but there were no injuries.[38] Border-control talks[edit] Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority which controls the West Bank, held talks on 27 January in Jerusalem on the border breach.[39] Abbas reportedly wants to take over Gaza's border crossings, including the one with Egypt that Palestinians in Gaza breached,[39] but Israel resisted the idea of giving the West Bank-based government control of the Gaza crossings, citing concerns about security.[39] Hamas and Fatah, who controlled Gaza before the last election, have accepted an invitation from Egypt to hold separate talks in Cairo on the border crisis.[2][40] All sides hoped to create a plan to keep the border between Egypt and Gaza open.[7] A Hamas delegation also met with Saudi Prince Saud al-Faisal who has acted as a mediator between Hamas and Fatah.[41] An Israeli defense delegation secretly visited Cairo on 28 January and discussed the situation with top Egyptian officials the London-based Asharq Alawsat newspaper reported. According to the report, the delegation relayed to Egypt Israel's fears that Palestinian militants would smuggle weapons and explosives through Egypt's open border with the Gaza Strip.[42] The Egyptians stressed that Israel was the one responsible for the deterioration of the situation in the Gaza Strip and the eventual breaching of the border wall.[42] Hamas stated they would accept a return of the EU monitoring mission if it were to reside in Egypt or the Gaza Strip, as opposed to being based in Israel.[43] Border closure[edit] The border was closed by Egypt with Hamas's cooperation, except for travelers returning home, on 3 February.[10][44] Economic effects[edit] See also: Economy of the Palestinian territories In Arish alone, Gazans spent some US$250 million over five days.[5] Palestinians and Egyptians complained about soaring prices and shortages, especially of food.[45] Enormous demand for staple products from Gaza caused rampant inflation, as did the Egyptian government's decision to restrict goods coming into the border region in an effort to encourage the Palestinians to go back home.[45] Palestinians also accused Egyptians of price gouging, where prices have risen to the point where the cost of goods is sufficiently high that supply matches demand.[45] The breach created tens of thousands of temporary new jobs in Gaza where the returning caravans set up shop; unemployment had been at 40 percent.[5] Egyptian merchants also crossed into the Gaza Strip to sell their wares.[35] The food brought in from Egypt during the first six days would last Gazans three months, fuel about two days and cement for two weeks if the borders are resealed, according to various estimates from economists, business leaders and gas station owners.[5] However, were the border to remain open long term, Gaza's workers and manufacturers who had worked in the more upscale Israeli market before layoffs during the Second Intifada would have trouble competing in Egypt's low-wage economy, according to West Bank economist Nasser Abdel Karim.[5] International response[edit] Iran Tehran offered to send aid to Egypt to alleviate the effects of the breach.[46] United States U.S. President George W. Bush condemned Hamas for delivering "misery" to the Palestinian people, and called for talks to create a Palestinian state.[47] European Union The EU said it would consider sending its monitors back to Gaza's border with Egypt, and unveiled a new plan for getting aid to Palestinians.[48] See also[edit] Wikinews has related news: Residents of Gaza enter Egypt after destruction of border wall Blockade of the Gaza Strip Israeli–Palestinian conflict Political status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip Governance of the Gaza Strip References[edit] ^ a b c d e f "Gazans make new border wall hole: Palestinians have bulldozed down part of the Gaza-Egypt border wall again, hours after Egyptian troops blocked holes recently made by militants".

She subsequently earned her Ph.D. in American Civilization from Harvard University and her J.D. from Harvard Law School (from which she graduated at the age of 27). She completed a Future Law Professor's Fellowship and received her LLM from Georgetown University Law Center.[2] She credits her childhood exposure to diverse cultures, regions, and religions with creating her desire to study race.[3] Before joining the Princeton faculty, Perry taught at Rutgers School of Law in Camden for seven years. She received the New Professor of the Year award in her first year and was promoted to full professor at the end of five years, also winning the Board of Trustees Fellowship for Scholarly Excellence. Perry was also a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and an adjunct professor at both the Columbia University Institute for Research in African American Studies and Georgetown University Law Center.[4] In 2009, Perry left Rutgers to join the faculty of Princeton University. She currently holds the title of Hughes-Rogers Professor of African American Studies and is affiliated with the Programs in Law and Public Affairs and Gender and Sexuality Studies.[5] She has two forthcoming books, one on the history of the black national anthem (from Oxford University Press) and another on gender, neoliberalism, and the digital age (from Duke University Press).[6] In August 2014, Perry appeared on the public radio and podcast On Being, discussing race, community, and American consciousness with host Krista Tippett.[7] Publications[edit] Perry is the author of five books and has published numerous articles on law, cultural studies, and African-American studies, including a book about Lorraine Hansberry.[8] She also wrote the notes and introduction to the Barnes and Nobles Classics edition of the Narrative of Sojourner Truth.[9] Her work is largely influenced by the Birmingham and Frankfurt Schools, Critical Legal Studies, Critical Race Theory, and African-American literary criticism.[10] Through her scholarship, Perry has made significant contributions to the academic study of race and American hip hop music; she contributed a chapter to 2014's Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas's Illmatic (edited by Michael Eric Dyson and Sohail Daulatzai).

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On February 6, 2016, Perry was pulled over by the Princeton police for speeding.[11] Her driver's license was then found to be suspended due to unpaid parking tickets, one of which was two–three years old. Perry was arrested for the outstanding warrant and physically searched. She was handcuffed, transported to the police station, and handcuffed to a bench during the booking process. Perry posted bail and was released.[12] She subsequently drew parallels between police conduct in this incident and behavior cited in the national debate around racially-motivated mistreatment, actual or alleged, of African Americans by the police.[13] She appeared in municipal court the month after her arrest and paid $428 in traffic fines.[14] References[edit] ^ "Depth, complexity and beauty: this Princeton professor urges us to reclaim black history".

The battle was a major success for admiral Niels Juel and is regarded as the greatest naval victory in Danish naval history. Contents 1 Background 2 Prelude 3 The battle 4 Aftermath 5 Force 5.1 Danish fleet 5.2 Swedish fleet 6 Notes 7 References Background[edit] Main article: Scanian War Denmark, the Dutch Republic, Brandenburg and several German states were at war with Sweden and its allies as part of the larger Franco-Dutch War. After the defeat at the battle of Fehrbellin against a Brandenburg army, Swedish possessions in northern Germany were under great pressure and in need of reinforcements. Attempts to relieve the southern Baltic provinces had failed and the Danish fleet had inflicted a stunning blow to the Swedish navy at the battle of Öland in June 1676. The Swedish navy had lost three of its largest ships, Kronan, Svärdet and Äpplet, the Admiral of the Realm Lorentz Creutz and the experienced admiral Claas Uggla while the Danish fleet did not lose a single ship; the Danish navy had command of the Baltic for the remainder of that year. Denmark was able to prevent Sweden from reinforcing its German possessions, and at the same time was able to land a large army in Skåne to take the war to Swedish soil. The Swedish leadership under Charles XI managed to get the upper hand in the land war through the victories at Halmstad on 17 August and Lund on 4 December 1676. The Danish army under the leadership of Christian V had to retreat back to Landskrona and on 30 December, Helsingborg was recaptured by Swedish forces. Both sides needed to take control of the Baltic shipping lanes; the Danes to bolster their forces in Skåne and Sweden to relieve their possessions in northern Germany.[1] In Skåne, the Swedish and Danish armies came close to fighting a major battle at Rönneberga a few km north of Landskrona]] on 27 May 1677. The Swedish force was less than half the size of its Danish adversary and a battle was prevented only because the Danes were unaware of their advantage and called off an attack. Later that night, the Swedish generals convinced King Charles that the odds were hopeless and the Swedish army withdrew back to Kristianstad. Christian decided instead to attempt to seize Malmö, which was still in Swedish hands, to secure a base for his fleet. After a few weeks of siege, the Danes attempted to take the city by force on 25–26 June. The assault was beaten back with Danish losses of at least 3000 men and forced the Danes to retreat to Lund. Charles hoped that the success on land was followed up with a victory at sea, which would cut off supplies from the Danish army in Skåne and prevent it from evacuating back to Denmark. [2] Despite the defeat the previous year, the Swedish navy was in the Spring of 1677 still numerically superior to the Danish navy and posed a considerable threat. The Danish sea forces were reorganized off Zealand and the need to secure the sea lanes between Denmark and Skåne was of paramount importance. The Dutch allies of Denmark promised to send reinforcements. Cornelis Tromp, an experienced admiral who commanded the combined Dutch-Danish fleet the year before had been sent to speed up the arrangements, but would not reach Copenhagen until 2 July.[3] The Swedish navy, on the other hand, had major difficulties securing supplies and equipment for its ships and were unable to recruit enough manpower.[4] Henrik Horn was appointed commander-in-chief of the Swedish navy in March 1677, becoming the third consecutive navy chief (after Gustaf Otto Stenbock and Lorentz Creutz) without any naval experience. The Danish fleet, on the other hand, was well-staffed with capable, experienced officers, which placed the Swedes at a marked disadvantage from the outset. Horn was quickly informed that Dutch reinforcements under Tromp were heading for the Baltic, and on 21 April he was received orders from King Charles to join the main body of the Swedish fleet with a minor squadron anchored off Gothenburg under the command of Erik Sjöblad. The main fleet did not get to sea until early June, but Sjöblad nevertheless sailed as early as 20 May to join Horn. Sjöblad tried to sail through the Great Belt, but was becalmed for on the 23rd and did not pass Langeland until the 29th.[5] At the battle of Møn, a superior Danish force won a decisive victory, sinking or capturing more than half of the Swedish vessels and taking Sjöblad prisoner.[6] Prelude[edit] Efter his victory, Juel repaired and re-supplied his ships and sent out patrols to scout south of Öland. On 17 June, he was informed that the Swedes planned to transport cavalry units from Pomerania to Skåne and sent out three frigates to search for transport ships. The scouting group returned on 21 June to report that they have been chased by Swedish ships and sighted a fleet of 30 warships and 15 supply vessels and fireships. The day after, a war council was held and the decision was made to sail out in force to cruise between Skåne and the island of Rügen, however the fleet was forced to sty off Stevns Peninsula due to unfavorable winds.[7] There was some uncertainty whether to allow Juel to meet the Swedish force straight away, or to avoid battle and wait the arrival of Tromp and his reinforcements. The original order was to was to engage the Swedish force directly, but the weather delay made Danish military leadership hesitant, especially Grand Chancellor Frederik Ahlefelt. At the same time, there were express orders from the King Christian to avoid battle. After his experiences facing the Swedish navy, Jul was convinced that there was little risk of defeat even against a numerically superior force.[8] The Swedish main fleet had left its base on Dalarö, near Stockholm, on 9 June and two days later was joined off Öland by two ships from its Gothenburg squadron and the newly built 60-gun Kalmar. The Swedish Admiral Horn spent almost two weeks training his crews by cruising between the island of Bornholm and the Swedish mainland. On 24–30 June, the two fleets maneuvered in the Sound and south of Skåne and finally sighted each other between Stevns Klint and Falsterbo on the afternoon of 30 June.[7] The battle[edit] Movements of the forces during the battle; based on illustration in R. C. Anderson's Naval Wars in the Baltic 1553-1850 from 1910 The night between 30 June and 1 July, the Swedish formed up for attack. In the dark, the 64-gun S:t Hieronymus went aground and was not able to be dislodged to fight the following day. Early in the morning, both sides formed battle lines towards south-southwest between Stevns Klint and Falsterbo. At the head of the Swedish line was its thirds squadron headed by Wachtmeister, the first squadron under Horn in the middle and the second squadron under Clerck in the rear. There has been a debate among historians about the order of the squadrons in the Danish line, but it was positioned north of the Swedish line and blocked the path through the Sound. Horn chose to attempt to sail westwards rather than attacking despite outnumbering Juel with 29 warships to 17. His intent was to cut off the Danes from their bases on Zealand. During the race towards the coast that ensued, the two forces exchange gun fire and Horn attempted to disrupt the Danish line by attacking with a fireship. Juel's men managed to tow the fireship away with a longboat and one of the minor supply vessels. At Stevns Klint, the Swedish 66-gun Draken ran aground and was forced to surrender after facing heavy gun fire from several Danish ships, including Juel's own 58-gun flagship Christianus V. The flagship was so badly damaged during the battle that Juel had to move his flag to the 64-gun Fridericus III in Marquor Rodsten's squadron and when this ship also suffered damage, moved on to the 64-gun Charlotta Amalia. When the forces approach the coast, the Swedish line turned north and both fleets sailed parallel to each other into the Sound.[9] Around midday, off the village of Højerup on Stevns Klint, Wachtmeister in the Swedish lead squadron sighted a force of eight large warships and relayed this to Horn. What he had sighted was Rodsten's squadron that had moved further to the north under cover of a dense fog of gunpowder smoke. Horn wrongly believed that Rodsten's squadron was still left somewhere in the gunsmoke and assumed that the Dutch reinforcements under Tromp had arrived. To avoid battle with what he believed would be a superior force, he decided to make an evasive maneuver. Horn let Wachtmeister continue north to attack what he believed were Dutch reinforcements while the rest of the Swedish force turned east-southeast, the position where he thought Rodsten's squadron was located. Juel's at first joined battled with Wachtmeister, men then set course for the main Swedish force together with Rodsten's third squadron when he noticed that Horn was heading eastwards. When the Danes moved in on the Swedish line, the did not turn parallel to it, but instead chose to cut off Clerck's squadron, which was behind Horn. A the same time, Rodsten sailed up on the other side of cut-off squadron, subjecting them to fire from both sides. Horn's squadron turned to relieve Clerck's squadron and the a violent gun duel ensued. The outmaneuvered Swedish force was not able to put up an effective defense, and both the 72-gun Mars and the 60-gun Caesar were captured.[10] Aftermath[edit] Gold medal struck in 1677 to commemorate the Danish victory from the collections of the National Museum of Denmark; the medal depicts the Swedish Caesar being captured and having her colors struck The battle was a decisive victory for Denmark and an embarrassing defeat for Sweden. At the price of only about 100 dead, 275 wounded and no ships lost, the Danish fleet had inflicted over 3,000 Swedish casualties.[11] The Swedes six large warships, an armed merchant, a large frigate, two fireships and a boyer.[12] The defeat of the Swedish fleet also gave Denmark-Norway control of the Baltic sea, and thereby the inner supply lines of the Swedish Empire. Admiral Tromp's fleet was ordered to "burn and defile, plunder, kill or abduct the people",[13] with the intention of luring Swedish troops away from Scania and thus relieve the land-bound operations. Although Öland and parts of the coast of Småland were devastated, king Charles XI didn't move any forces from main front in Scania. During the remainder of the war, Denmark completely dominated at sea, even after the Netherlands made peace with Sweden in 1678. The Swedish fleet avoided further confrontations and could no longer maintain the line of communication with Swedish Pomerania; the last Swedish troops, on Rügen capitulated to Brandenburg in December 1678. Juel's order to turn into the Swedish line, cutting it in two, rather than going up parallel to it has been the subject of extensive discussion among military historians. During the 19th century, Danish and Norwegian naval historians interpreted it as a groundbreaking tactical innovation that had a major impact on tactical doctrine at the time. In their opinion, Juel had innovated the concept of "breaking the line" a century before it was used by Admiral George Rodney is his decisive victory against a French fleet in the Battle of the Saintes in 1782, during the American Revolutionary War. More recent historians have questioned previous conclusions of Juel's maneuvers and pointed to the fact that contemporary sea officers were well aware of the advantages of breaking an opponents line, but had still not developed the degree of discipline, cohesion and organization required to allow the tactic to be applied consistently and reliably. Force[edit] The Swedish fleet had clear superiority in numbers of ships, guns and men. The Swedish force had 30 large and medium warships, 6 fireships and 11 lesser support ships. Altogether the it was equipped with 1,650 guns and 9,200 men. The Danish force had 35 warships, 2 fireships and 7 support ships with a total of 1,400 guns.[14] Several Danish ships were undermanned and the total manpower was only 6,700. However, some of the Swedish ships were not purpose-built warships but rather armed merchants. In terms of leadership and quality of crew, the Danish force had a clear superiority.[15] The figures in parentheses is the number of guns according to existing sources. Fireships were regular ships repurposed to be set on fire and floated toward enemy ships to set them aflame or force them to scatter.

Most cache control instructions do not affect the semantics of a program, although some can. Contents 1 Examples 1.1 Prefetch 1.2 Instruction prefetch 1.3 Data cache block allocate zero 1.4 Data cache block invalidate 1.5 Data cache block flush 1.6 Other hints 2 Alternatives 2.1 Automatic prefetch 2.2 Scratchpad memory 2.3 Vector fetch 3 References Examples[edit] Several such instructions, with variants, are supported by several processor instruction set architectures, such as ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, and x86. Prefetch[edit] Also termed data cache block touch, the effect is to request loading the cache line associated with a given address. This is performed by the PREFETCH instruction in the x86 instruction set. Some variants bypass higher levels of the cache hierarchy, which is useful in a 'streaming' context for data that is traversed once, rather than held in the working set. The prefetch should occur sufficiently far ahead in time to mitigate the latency of memory access, for example in a loop traversing memory linearly. The GNU Compiler Collection intrinsic function __builtin_prefetch can be used to invoke this in the programming languages C or C++. Instruction prefetch[edit] A variant of prefetch for the instruction cache. Data cache block allocate zero[edit] This hint is used to prepare cache lines before overwriting the contents completely. In this example, the CPU needn't load anything from main memory. The semantic effect is equivalent to an aligned memset of a cache-line sized block to zero, but the operation is effectively free. Data cache block invalidate[edit] This hint is used to discard cache lines, without committing their contents to main memory. Care is needed since incorrect results are possible. Unlike other cache hints, the semantics of the program are significantly modified. This is used in conjunction with allocate zero for managing temporary data. This saves unneeded main memory bandwidth and cache pollution. Data cache block flush[edit] This hint requests the immediate eviction of a cache line, making way for future allocations. It is used when it is known that data is no longer part of the working set. Other hints[edit] Some processors support a variant of load–store instructions that also imply cache hints. An example is load last in the PowerPC instruction set, which suggests that data will only be used once, i.e., the cache line in question may be pushed to the head of the eviction queue, whilst keeping it in use if still directly needed. Alternatives[edit] Automatic prefetch[edit] In recent times, cache control instructions have become less popular as increasingly advanced application processor designs from Intel and ARM devote more transistors to accelerating code written in traditional languages, e.g., performing automatic prefetch, with hardware to detect linear access patterns on the fly. However the techniques may remain valid for throughput-oriented processors, which have a different throughput vs latency tradeoff, and may prefer to devote more area to execution units. Scratchpad memory[edit] Some processors support scratchpad memory into which temporaries may be put, and direct memory access (DMA) to transfer data to and from main memory when needed. This approach is used by the Cell processor, and some embedded systems. These allow greater control over memory traffic and locality (as the working set is managed by explicit transfers), and eliminates the need for expensive cache coherency in a manycore machine. The disadvantage is it requires significantly different programming techniques to use. It is very hard to adapt programs written in traditional languages such as C and C++ which present the programmer with a uniform view of a large address space (which is an illusion simulated by caches). A traditional microprocessor can more easily run legacy code, which may then be accelerated by cache control instructions, whilst a scratchpad based machine requires dedicated coding from the ground up to even function. Cache control instructions are specific to a certain cache line size, which in practice may vary between generations of processors in the same architectural family. Caches may also help coalescing reads and writes from less predictable access patterns (e.g., during texture mapping), whilst scratchpad DMA requires reworking algorithms for more predictable 'linear' traversals. As such scratchpads are generally harder to use with traditional programming models, although dataflow models (such as TensorFlow) might be more suitable. Vector fetch[edit] Vector processors (for example modern graphics processing unit (GPUs) and Xeon Phi) use massive parallelism to achieve high throughput whilst working around memory latency (reducing the need for prefetching). Many read operations are issued in parallel, for subsequent invocations of a compute kernel; calculations may be put on hold awaiting future data, whilst the execution units are devoted to working on data from past requests data that has already turned up. This is easier for programmers to leverage in conjunction with the appropriate programming models (compute kernels), but harder to apply to general purpose programming. The disadvantage is that many copies of temporary states may be held in the local memory of a processing element, awaiting data in flight.

In February 2007, Hadouken! self-released a two-song limited edition vinyl, a double-a side of "That Boy That Girl" and "Tuning In". The former gained popularity after the video made it to number one in MTV Two's NME Chart.[2] Hadouken! played their first gig at the Dirty Hearts Club in Southend on 16 September 2006.[3] They played their debut London gig the following week at the notorious Another Music Another Kitchen night at Proud Gallery in Camden. They recorded demos and spent their first six months playing gigs predominantly in Leeds and London. In December 2006, Hadouken! recruited bass player Chris Purcell. The band first began getting noticed more widely in 2006. It was 2007 though, when success properly came to the band. In January 2007 Mike Skinner of The Streets gave the band one of their first radio plays, he played future single 'That Boy That Girl' on BBC Radio 1 whilst guest presenting Zane Lowe's new music show, describing the band as 'a great new band.' In February 2007 the band released what is said to be an internet phenomenon,[4] described as "a savage, snarling work of genius", by NME.[5] single double a-side "That Boy That Girl/Tuning In" through the band's own label, Surface Noise Records. A video was also made for the track by friend of the band Bobby Harlow, which charted successfully in the MTV Two/NME chart. The latter, "Tuning In" appeared as a remix on Kitsuné Music's compilation album, Kitsuné Maison Compilation 4, titled "Tuning In [H! Re-rub]". The remix also was used as a b-side on the 10-inch single from Kitsuné Music, released on 7 May 2007. Liquid Lives was released as the band's second single release on 25 June 2007.[6] The song received moderate airplay on MTV2, and charted successfully in the NME Chart Show. The band released a new video for the track, as well as an exclusive live video recorded as part of "MTV2 Live". "Liquid Lives" marked Hadouken!'s first move into the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 36 on 1 July.[7] In June 2007, the band completed a full UK tour supported by Electro/Punk band Does It Offend You, Yeah? and rapper Example.

(January 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hadouken!'s third single, "Leap of Faith", was a digital only release on 12 November 2007. The song was taken from their Not Here to Please You mixtape. The mixtape or EP includes the bands remixes of Bloc Party and Plan B and a new remix of a Bolt Action Five song, as well as some older songs that have been re-recorded. The mixtape was released on 12 November 2007 and was only available in USB format. Throughout September, October and November 2007 Hadouken! played a UK tour with support from fellow Leeds band Shut Your Eyes and You'll Burst Into Flames as well as Manchester based The Whip, The Ghost Frequency and Late of the Pier. The tour coincided with the release of "Leap of Faith" and their new mixtape Not Here to Please You. On 7 January 2008, Hadouken! were guest presenters on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. On the show Hadouken! referred to previous single 'Leap of Faith' as an experiment and suggested the album would draw more on their dance music influences, comparing it to The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. On 17 February 2008 the band released the first studio recording from their upcoming untitled album, the track titled "Get Smashed Gate Crash" was released on the band's MySpace. On 3 March 2008, Hadouken! announced the album's title (Music for an Accelerated Culture), as well as details of the promo track for the album; "Get Smashed Gate Crash". For the Masses and The M.A.D.

(January 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In mid-2009, the band recorded their second studio album, For the Masses, in the Netherlands with drum and bass producers Noisia. They described the new album as being different, both lyrically and musically, and posted frequent updates via their Twitter account. In August, the band confirmed the release of the M.A.D. EP, which contained 3 brand new tracks and 3 remixes of the track "M.A.D.". The EP was released digitally in September. The band's second studio album, For the Masses, was released on 25 January 2010. The band unveiled their new single, "Turn the Lights Out" on 10 November 2009 on their Myspace. On 25 January 2010, Hadouken! released For the Masses, which reached No. 17 in the UK album chart on the week of its release. The album was followed up by a new mix of single "Mic Check" which included a sample from Tina Moore's "Never Gonna Let You Go". In May 2010, Hadouken! wrote an anthem, "Things Could Only Get Worse", for the UK Labour Party as part of the lead up to the 2010 General Election. Mecha Love and The Oxygen EP and other activity (2010–2011)[edit] Hadouken! revealed on 30 May 2010, via Twitter,[8] that work has been started on their third album, and on 31 May, they revealed demos of new tracks had been written.[9] A new single, "Mecha Love", was released on 17 October. Following the radio debut of "Mecha Love", James Smith confirmed that a second single had been recorded and was ready for release. "Oxygen" was released digitally on 7 November 2010; the "Oxygen" EP was later released on 18 January 2012. In 2011, the band played at London's O2 Arena, for the Transformation Trust Rock Assembly. Every Weekend (2011–present)[edit] On 18 April 2011 Hadouken! signed to independent label Ministry of Sound with whom they released two singles 'Bad Signal' and 'Parasite'.. On 12 April 2012, Zane Lowe premiered the band's new single "Parasite" on his BBC Radio 1 show and it was made available as on their website as a free download soon after.[10][11] The remixes were revealed on their official Soundcloud page.[12] On 12 June 2012, Zane Lowe gave "Bad Signal", their new single, released 5 August 2012, its first play, on his BBC Radio 1 show. On 17 August 2012, the band supported Example alongside DJ Fresh at the iTunes Festival. They performed a new track "Daylight" for the second ever time live, produced by Drumsound and Bassline Smith alongside a mixture of new and old tracks. On 27 December 2012, the band announced that their third studio album will be called 'Every Weekend' and will be released through their own label 'Surface Noise Recordings'. The group made an appearance in 2012 on Feed Me's "Trapdoor" and James provided vocals for KillSonik's song "Slaughterhouse" this year. On 22 January 2013 Hadouken! released a follow up video to 'People Are Awesome', titled 'People Are Awesome 2013'. The video featured the track 'Levitate' taken from the album 'Every Weekend'. 'People Are Awesome 2013' was the number one most watched video on YouTube around the world, gaining 20 million views in its first week.[13] The video currently has over 100 million views on YouTube, making it more successful than the first 'People Are Awesome' viral, which currently sits at 66 million views. The track 'Levitate' went on to gain a top 2 position in 3 territories[which?] and a top position 40 in 28 countries.[citation needed] It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 97. The album Every Weekend was released on 18 March 2013. Hadouken! also featured on Loadstar's song "Boa" from the album Future Perfect and Tom Swoon & Paris Blohm's single "Synchronize".

After studying film in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, he graduated from the University of Rennes.[3] The Silence of the Forest was a project conceived by Ouénangaré, who approached Bassek Ba Kobhio to help find financing.[4] It was written in French and Sango, and filmed in Central African Republic and Gabon. It tells the story of Gonaba, an African educated in Europe, who decides to return to his homeland, but increasingly realises the impossibility of breaking through stereotypes and genuinely understanding the way of life of the Baka people, the 'people of the forest' whom he pejoratively labels 'pygmies'.[5] Ouénangaré died on 29 September 2006.[1] Filmography[edit] Le silence de la forêt [The Silence of the Forest], 2003 References[edit] ^ a b Ouenangaré Didier, Africiné ^ Blandine Stefanson (2014).

This is provided by mkisofs (from the cdrtools package) or genisoimage (from the cdrkit package) or a symbolic link xorrisofs to xorriso (from the libisoburn or GNU xorriso package).[2] Released under the GNU General Public License, dvd+rw-tools is free software. Contents 1 Programs 2 growisofs 3 References 4 External links Programs[edit] growisofs burns data to DVD or BD media. dvd+rw-mediainfo reports about drive and medium status. dvd+rw-format formats some types of media, blanks DVD-RW media. dvd-ram-control controls Defect Management and write protection of DVD-RAM media. dvd+rw-booktype sets the Book Type property of DVD media. growisofs[edit] growisofs is a SCSI/MMC driver in userspace for burning optical media, like cdrecord or libburn. Its original purpose is to coordinate burning with a run of mkisofs, so that ISO 9660 multi-session becomes possible on DVD+RW media. But soon it supported all kinds of DVD media and later also BD (Blu-ray) media. Further it can burn preformatted data images onto the media, not needing any ISO 9660 formatter program for this task. growisofs employs a Ring Buffer in userspace to smoothen the data transmission to the drive. The fill level of this buffer is reported during a burn run as "RBU", whereas the fill level of the drive's built-in buffer is reported as "UBU". References[edit] ^ Polyakov, Andy (27 November 2003).

Contents 1 Life 2 Notable namesake 3 Gallery 4 See also 5 References Life[edit] Tudwal was said to be the son of Hoel Mawr (Hoel I) and a brother of Saint Lenorius.[1] Tudwal travelled to Ireland to learn the scriptures, and then became a hermit on Saint Tudwal's Island East, off the coast of North Wales. Tudwal later immigrated to Brittany, settling in Lan Pabu with 72 followers, where he established a large monastery under the patronage of his cousin, King Deroch of Domnonée. He traveled to Paris to obtain confirmation of the land grant from King Childebert I, who insisted be was Bishop of Tréguier.[2] Tudwal is shown in iconography as a bishop holding a dragon, now the symbol of Tregor. His feast day is celebrated on 30 November or 1 December. Tro Breizh (Breton for "Tour of Brittany") is a pilgrimage that links the towns of the seven founding saints of Brittany. These seven saints were Celtic monks from Britain from around the 5th or 6th century who went to Brittany to minister to the Britons who had settled there after the Anglo-Saxon incursions in their homeland.[3] Among the first bishoprics was Tréguier, Saint Tudwal's town.

It was described by van Nieukerken and Geertsema in 2015. It is found in South Africa[1] (Western Cape, Northern Cape and Gauteng). The wingspan is 3.9–4.9 mm for males and 4–4.6 mm for females. The forewings of the males are grey brown, slightly irrorate, caused by scales being dark tipped and paler at the base. There is a silver-white pattern on the forewings, consisting of a triangular dorsal spot at one-fourth, usually associated with a minor spot of just a few scales at the costa, that may be joined to the dorsal spot, or even completely absent. There is a second triangular dorsal spot at 1/2, reaching almost to the middle of the wing and a triangular costal spot just beyond the middle, always separate. The females have the scales almost uniformly dark fuscous with a purplish tinge, resulting in darker, velvety wing colour and contrasting silvery-white pattern. The first costal and dorsal spots are joined to form a narrow fascia, wider at dorsum. The second dorsal and costal spots are as in males. The species is multivoltine, with adults on wing from September to early May. The larvae feed on Rhoicissus digitata and Vitis vinifera. The larvae mine the leaves of their host plant. The majority of the mines on Vitis start at the leaf edge, but even there the egg is always near the vein in the tip of a lobe. Some mines originate close to the leaf midrib. Also, the few studied mines on Rhoicissus start at the leaf tip. The mine starts as a much contorted narrow gallery, often first in a zigzag pattern with U-turns, eventually enlarging into an irregular wide gallery or a blotch. The frass is brown in the early mine, later black, in a rather thin line in the centre of the gallery. Later, the frass is in clumps in a wider central line.[2] Lifecycle[edit] Leafmine on Rhoicissus digitata Leafmine on Vitis vinifera Trunk of Vitis with many cocoons with exuviae Grapes with fresh cocoons attached Adult male Adult male References[edit] ^ Beccaloni, G.; Scoble, M.; Kitching, I.; Simonsen, T.; Robinson, G.; Pitkin, B.; Hine, A.; Lyal, C., eds.

As KSHV establishes latent infection in tumorous foci, it invariably expresses high levels of the viral LANA protein, which is necessary and sufficient to maintain the KSHV episome. Encoded by ORF73, LANA-1 is one of few HHV-8 encoded proteins that is highly expressed in all latently infected tumour cells; specifically, it is a phosphoprotein with an acidic internal repeat domain flanked by a carboxy-terminal domain and an amino-terminal domain.[5] LANA-1 acts as a transcriptional regulator, and it has been implicated directly in oncogenesis because of its ability to bind to the tumour-suppressing protein p53 and to the retinoblastoma protein pRb. This leads to the inactivation of p53-dependent promoters and induction of E2F-dependent genes.[8][9] Studies have also shown that LANA-1 can transactivate the promoter of the reverse transcriptase subunit of the human telomerase holoenzyme,[9] thus overextending a critical step in cellular transformation.[10] Paradoxically, LANA-1 has been shown to be involved in transcriptional repression [11][12][13] and can, moreover, interact with the mSin3/HDAC1 co-repressor complex.[12] It has been also shown to interact with and inhibit the ATF4/CREB2 transcription factor that interacts with the basic transcription machinery[14] and to bind with two human chromosome-associated cellular proteins, MeCP2 and DEK.[12] LANA-1 is associated with cellular chromatin and stays on the chromosomes during cell division.[15] It maintains the viral genomes during cell division by tethering the viral episomes to the chromosomes.[16] It binds directly to replication origin recognition complexes (ORCs) that are primarily associated with the terminal repeat (TR) region of the HHV-8 genome.[17] Notes and references[edit] ^ Moore PS, Gao SJ, Dominguez G, Cesarman E, Lungu O, Knowles DM, Garber R, Pellett PE, McGeoch DJ, Chang Y (January 1996).

Since the late 1950s, the increasing demand for and availability of sophisticated scuba diving equipment has also created concerns about protecting valuable underwater archaeology sites and shellfish fishing stocks.[1] The 12 October 2000 USS Cole bombing was not carried out by underwater divers, but did bring renewed attention to the vulnerability they present for naval ships. Divers can swim 100 to 200 yards in about three minutes, and large sonar ranges would be required around ships for security forces to detect underwater swimmers in time to make an effective response.[2] In March 2005 the Philippine military, while interrogating a captured anti-government terrorist bomber, found that two of Southeast Asia’s most dangerous terrorist organizations linked to Al Qaeda were said to be jointly training militants in scuba diving for attacks at sea.[3] Swimmers can approach from the surface or underwater, each presenting its own detection and deterrence challenges. The interception and apprehension of intruders detected in bodies of water pose unique safety risks.[2][clarification needed] Zones of operations include: Underwater.[2] At the surface of water.[2] In small boats. In larger vessels. Apprehension of suspected frogmen onshore, before or after they dive. Potential theaters of operation:[citation needed] In an enclosed security area, e.g. a harbor. In open water to protect submerged artifacts (usually undersea archaeological sites). In open water (often on a frontier) to prevent smuggling. In open water to protect sea life. (This, on a small scale, may be defined to include various known unofficial actions by inshore fishermen to protect their shellfish stocks.) Recreational divers and underwater security[edit] Maintaining underwater security against intrusion on or under the water has been complicated by the expansion of recreational scuba diving since the mid-1950s, making it unacceptable in most democracies to use potentially lethal methods against any suspicious underwater sighting or sonar echo in areas not officially closed to recreational divers. Routine investigation of all "unidentified frogman" reports would be swamped by reports of recreational divers who were not in military areas.[citation needed] For a long time it would be easy for diving professionals and other experienced divers to distinguish a sport diver with an open-circuit scuba such as an aqualung from a combat frogman with a rebreather; and legitimate civilian divers are normally fairly easy to detect because they dive from land or from a surface boat, rarely or never from an underwater craft, and willingly advertise their presence for their own safety;[4] but recent multiplication in sport rebreather use may have changed that somewhat.[citation needed] In the past, when scuba diving was less common, many non-divers, including police, patrol and guards, knew little about diving and did not know of this difference in diving gear, but described all divers as "frogmen". One result was an incident in the inter-ethnic crisis in Cyprus in 1974 when a tourist was arrested for suspected spying because "frogman's kit" was found in his car: it was ordinary sport scuba gear.[citation needed] After about 1990 the rapid growth in the number of sport diving rebreather brands has clouded this distinction, while advanced sport divers increasingly tackle longer, deeper, riskier dives using equipment once available only to armed forces or professionals. This means that even techniques for trapping them underwater, disorienting them, or forcing them to the surface would be an unacceptable risk to civilian divers' lives.[citation needed] Another result of sport diving is a risk of civilians independently re-developing, and then using or selling on the free market, technologies, such as technical advances in underwater communications equipment, formerly kept as military secrets.[citation needed] (For a loss of military secrecy caused by independent civilian duplication, though not underwater, see Lokata Company.) There have been incidents which have demonstrated poor underwater security, such as when a sport diver with a noisy bubbly open-circuit scuba and no combat training entered a naval anchorage and signed his name on the bottom of a warship.[citation needed] Concern at the risk of increasing the sport-diving public's ability to penetrate harbors undetected, and of unofficial groups equipping combat frogmen from the sport scuba trade, might have led to the events listed at "#Prevention" below.[original research?][citation needed] Detection[edit] The MSST (Maritime Safety and Security Team) is a United States Coast Guard harbor and inshore patrol and security team who specialize in Naval Security.[citation needed] Besides the visual detection by guards, a number of other systems are also used by security forces to prevent infiltration by frogmen. Underwater[edit] Ultrasound detection Artificial intelligence and electronic neural networks and developments in ultrasound have made possible specialized diver-detector sonars.[citation needed] Examples of diver-detecting active sonar systems are: Sonardyne SENTINEL diver detection sonar AN/WQX-2 AquaShield Diver Detection Sonar[5] Designed to protect energy installations, ports and coastal facilities Cerberus (sonar) CSDS-85 Omni Surveillance Sonar[6] made by CTech DDS 9000 multibeam diver detection sonar: by Kongsberg Gruppen DDS-J diver-detection sonar[7] designed to protect underwater oil pipelines: by Westminster International Ltd Harbour Surveillance Sonar by Marport C-Tech Ltd.[8] NuvoSonic Underwater Port Security System WESMAR Web System[9] Trained animals Trained dolphins and sea lions can find submerged divers. Both can see, and hear direction of sound, well underwater, and dolphins have natural sonar.[2]:3 The United States Navy’s MK6 Marine Mammal System is supported by SPAWAR and uses dolphins to find and mark mines and divers in the water. This system was used in: Vietnam in 1970-71.[citation needed] Persian Gulf in 1987–1988.[citation needed] San Diego harbor for security during the 1996 Republican National Convention.[citation needed] Animals, unlike remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV), etc., need to be fed and kept fit and in training whether they are needed at work or not, and cannot be laid aside in a storeroom until needed. Remote-controlled underwater vehicles A remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) could search for submerged divers; but ROVs are expensive to run, and as technology is now could not attack several targets one after another as quickly as a marine mammal.[2]:13 An underwater ROV needs to be controlled. It could find and identify divers, and perhaps deter them. It should not be easily overpowered or attacked or outpaced by the suspect divers. If it is to attack the suspects, it should carry a suitable weapon.[citation needed] "OWL"-type surface ROV (also known as the Unmanned Harbor Security Vehicle) used to search for submerged divers Surface ROV A surface ROV can move on its own and scan below itself with sonar, but without a long-range weapon it can do little against deeply submerged suspect divers.[citation needed][original research?] Surveillance of civilian divers[edit] A few sources claim the FBI asked the USA's largest scuba diver certification organizations to turn over the records of all divers certified since 1998; this turning-over is now done once a year.[1][2][3][unreliable source?] Anti-frogman weapons[edit] Sound[edit] See also: ultrasound and sonic weaponry The main effects of ultrasound on the human body are heating and cavitation.[2] Analysis of research literature related to effects of ultrasound concluded that reported ultrasound-caused organ damage was associated with sound pressure levels exceeding a certain intensity threshold, regardless of frequency[2] The UPSS/IAS diver-detector sonar system includes an underwater shockwave emitter. Westminster International have implemented audible sound based defense systems.[10] These systems irritate or cause pain to the target's ears. Diver aversion to low frequency sound is dependent upon sound pressure level and center frequency.[11] Underwater firearms[edit] These underwater firearms fire a steel rod, not a bullet, for better range underwater. They are all more powerful than a speargun, and can fire several shots before reloading. Their barrels are not rifled; the fired projectile is kept in line underwater by hydrodynamic effects, and is somewhat inaccurate when fired out of water.[citation needed] Other underwater man-carried weapons[edit] For a long time the diver's standard weapon and tool has been a heavy knife.[citation needed] A catalog issued in 1991 by Life Support Engineering (now Mercury Products) contained several military / commando type diving kit items and also a compressed-air powered speargun.[citation needed] Underwater, a baton would have to be used for thrusting or jabbing, not swung, due to water resistance, and designed accordingly. The target's solar plexus will probably be protected by his diving gear.[citation needed] Trained animals, as weapons[edit] The US Navy has deployed sea lions to detect divers in the Persian Gulf.[12] The sea lion is trained to detect the diver, connect a marker buoy to his leg by a C-shaped handcuff-like clamp, surface, and then bark loudly to raise the alarm. 20 sea lions have been trained for this at the US Naval Warfare Systems Center in San Diego. Some have been flown to Bahrain to help the Harbor Patrol Unit to guard the US Navy's 5th Fleet. Sea lions adapt easily to warm water, can dive repeatedly and swim up to 25 mph, can see in near-darkness, and can determine the direction of underwater sound. In training the sea lions have been known to chase divers onto land. See also this link. From 1970 to 1980 trained dolphins killed two Soviet frogmen who were putting limpet mines on a US cargo ship in Cam Ranh bay in Vietnam.[13] Subsequently, Soviet PDSS frogmen were trained to fight back against trained dolphins. In an incident on the coast of Nicaragua PDSS frogmen killed trained anti-frogman dolphins. Arrival of underwater rifles and pistols seems to make the trained animal threat less.[citation needed] Animals, unlike ROVs etc., need to be fed and kept in training whether they are needed at work or not, and cannot be laid aside in a storeroom until needed.[citation needed] Remote-controlled underwater vehicle, as weapon[edit] A ROV, as well as searching, could be equipped to arrest or attack divers on command, but with their technology as it is could not attack several targets one after another as quickly as a marine mammal. A surface-only ROV would need a long-range weapon to be effective against deeply submerged suspect divers.[citation needed][original research?] Prevention[edit] Preventing public access to frogman-type diving gear, or to any diving gear[edit] Siebe Gorman had a policy in Great Britain until around 1956 of keeping prices of aqualungs too high for most civilians to afford; legal restrictions on exporting currency stopped people from importing cheaper foreign aqualungs. See Timeline of underwater technology#Public interest in scuba diving takes off for how this barrier broke down, starting with British sport divers making their own aqualungs from ex-RAF cylinders and converted Calor gas regulators.[citation needed] The Subskimmer, which is useful for covert underwater penetration, took decades to develop and passed through at least three firms and is still too expensive for sport divers and sport diving centers. Siebe Gorman consistently refused to sell rebreathers to the civilian public. Mixture rebreather development was kept away from the public eye and the sport scuba trade until the end of the Cold War in 1991. As a result, when North Sea Oil exploration started in the 1960s, the oil drilling firms needing deep-dive work had to develop nitrox diving techniques independently, from concept up, without using the Royal Navy's know-how; and then the Navy revealed that they had used nitrox diving (which the Navy called "mixture") before 1945.[citation needed] In the US, military rebreathers were not marketed to the public primarily due to cost and attendant legal liability issues. Legal issues still tend to discourage the development and sale of the rebreather in the US, though acceptance and use is growing.[citation needed][original research?] The US military has not tried to stop sales of rebreathers to the public in the US. It has realized that recreational SCUBA has now exceeded earlier military SCUBA in quality, and hopes that a similar increase in quality and decrease in price will come from commercial-off-the-shelf rebreather equipment.[citation needed][original research?] Prevention technology[edit] Technology exists where underwater speaker systems can be deployed around the designated area.[14] This array of speaker systems can be programmed to send high powered frequencies which then blasts powerful 'disruption' signals into the water. The frequencies have a maximum disorientation effect on the diver(s), which induce discomfort or panic causing them to leave the area or surface for interception. In cases where the divers remain in the water, the frequencies are likely to have a continued adverse effect which could cause sickness and confusion.[citation needed] Preventing public access to water[edit] For sport divers and similar who have no means of covert entry, one method is merely to try to stop all divers from reaching water, or stopping them from using boats, in some particular place or area. Such a bylaw may be called for by the military to keep sport divers away from secret underwater sites, or by inshore fishermen to stop alleged poaching of shellfish.[citation needed] The US has made many such regulations to protect such infrastructures as power plant and nuclear plant water intakes and discharges, bridge foundations, harbor and pier installations, and naval facilities.[citation needed] Yugoslavia forbade all sport diving except a few Government-controlled groups, and required official permission for each campaign of archaeological or scientific diving.[citation needed] Surveillance of civilian divers[edit] A few sources claim the FBI asked the USA's largest scuba diver certification organizations to turn over the records of all divers certified since 1998; this turning-over is now done once a year.[4][5][6][unreliable source?] References[edit] ^ Akal, Tuncay.

Town in Saint-Louis, SenegalRichard TollTownRichard TollCoordinates: 16°28′N 15°41′W﻿ / ﻿16.467°N 15.683°W﻿ / 16.467; -15.683Country SenegalRegionSaint-LouisDepartmentDaganaPopulation • Total~90,000Time zoneUTC+0 (GMT) Richard Toll is a town in northern Senegal, lying on the south bank of the River Senegal, just east of Rosso. Originally a colonial town, it was named for the park of the Château de Baron Roger, laid out by botanist Jean Michel Claude Richard. A rice-growing scheme was originally initiated by France's colonial development organisation, FIDES, in 1949 with an initial cultivated area of 6,000 hectares (14,830 acres). The town's main industry is sugar. The estimated population in 2007 was 70,000. Contents 1 History 2 Population and demography 3 Neighbourhoods 4 Markets 5 Economic activities 6 Popular culture 7 References 8 External Links History[edit] The Château de Baron Roger. Until 1817 at roughly the location of Richard Toll there were two villages, Ndiangué and Xhouma, inhabited by the Mbodi people — descendants of Brack and followers of the royal Walo tradition. In 1817 the French government's most senior representative in the region, Schmaltz, created an outpost community on the River Senegal, naming it l’Escale. In 1822, the new governor, Baron Jacques-François Roger, sent a botanist and nurseryman named Jean Michel Claude Richard to work in L’Escale and renamed it Richard’s Toll, with Toll being the word for Farm in Pulaar, a local language. At this time there were 28 residents, and 1148 nomadic workers living in Toll. It grew greatly in 1945 with the creation of the Mission Agricole du Sénégal, which also brought other institutions such as a hospital, and chapel, and a school. There was a rapid demographic growth in 1970 with the implementation of the Compagnie Sucrière Sénégalaise, 'Senegal Sugar Company', which brought in around 15,000 inhabitants and brought about two phenomena: the joining of the local villages, and the creation of new neighbourhoods. By 1980 Richard Toll had six neighbourhoods: Escale, Ndaingué, Ndiaw, Khouma Wolof, Khouma Peul, and Ndombo Alarba. Since then the city has grown and evolved into what it is today, including the addition of neighbourhoods such as Campement, Thiaback, GAE2, and Taouey. Population and demography[edit] The latest estimate of the population available at the mayors office with was from 2005 which was at 46,547, however more recent estimates have put it around 90,000. The latest gender, and age breakdown the mayors office had was from 2006, which stated 77.79% of inhabitants were between the ages of 0 and 34, 20.71% were between the ages of 35 and 74, and 1.19% were over the age of 75. Women constituted 52.01% of the population, and men 47.99%. Neighbourhoods[edit] Richard Toll currently comprises 12 neighbourhoods: Ndiao, Ndiangué, Richard Toll Escale, Campement et Nourou, Thiabakh, Ndombo Alarba, Khouma Gallo Malick, Gae II, Khouma Yakh Sabar, and Khouma Mbodiène/Khouma Thiarène. Markets[edit] There are two markets in Toll, the Richard Toll market, and the Xhouma Market. The Richard Toll market is a little larger than the Xhouma market. It is located in the main part of the city, and encompasses about 3 square city blocks although it is hard to tell where the market ends, and the regular city begins. There are perhaps over 50 established stores, and stands in the market. The Xhouma market is located on the eastern side of town in a primarily Pulaar area. It is located off the main road, as opposed to the Richard Toll market which is in more of a city grid. Economic activities[edit] The main economic activities in Richard Toll are agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry, and commerce. Less popular economic activities are transportation, tourism, and artisanal goods. Richard Toll is most known for its sugar refinery, which is French-owned and exports sugar to most of Senegal. Popular culture[edit] Marie Laforêt has a song about Richard Toll.[1] References[edit] ^ Marie Laforêt's song about Richard Toll on YouTube External Links[edit] Yee, Amy (1 May 2018).

Gnote is part of the GNOME desktop environment, often filling the need for personal information management. The main principle is a notepad with a wiki-style interface. Words in the note body that match existing note titles automatically become hyperlinks, allowing for the management of large libraries of personal information, such as references to favorite artists that would then automatically be highlighted in notes containing their names. Plugins extend the program to include functionality like exporting to HTML and printing support. As of version 0.8.0, Gnote has been ported to GTK+3. Contents 1 History and uses 2 Features 3 Plugins 4 See also 5 References History and uses[edit] Gnote was created as a clone of Tomboy written in C++, to remove the dependency on Mono. Its release caused a minor controversy when the creator was accused of having an anti-Mono agenda. This prompted him to explain that Gnote was written as an exercise in porting Mono applications and that it provides a note-taking application for environments that are unable to fit the Mono framework.[3] The program is included in Fedora,[4] which dropped Mono from the Live CD installation disc, due to lack of space.[5] Some Linux-compatible hardware platforms are not officially supported by Mono, and thus cannot run Tomboy or other Mono software. On these platforms and any other, Gnote can be used as a drop-in replacement for Tomboy. Since version 3.5, Gnote has used GNOME version numbering scheme [1]. Features[edit] Some of the editing features supported by Gnote include: Link to other notes Style text (bold, italic, strikeout, highlight) Change font size Create bulleted lists Undo and redo Plugins[edit] Gnote supports plugins that add functionality: Print individual notes Sticky Notes importer Export single notes to HTML Bugzilla links Fixed width text Tomboy importer Backlinks, to see which notes link to the current note Underline text Insert timestamp Table of content See also[edit] Free and open-source software portal Comparison of notetaking software Personal wiki Wiki software References[edit] ^ Catanzaro, Michael (8 October 2020).

This aerodrome is near an area of the Restigouche River valley known for its good salmon fishing; consequently, many private and charter aircraft use this strip as a means of accessing nearby lodges in areas such as Larrys Gulch. There is no available parking for aircraft, only a wider turn-around area mid-runway, so all aircraft must depart after dropping off their passengers. References[edit] ^ Canada Flight Supplement.

Contents 1 Story 2 Cast 2.1 Supporting 2.2 Recurring 3 Crew 4 Episodes 5 References 6 External links Story[edit] The Triceraton Republic launches a massive invasion of Earth, believing Professor Honeycutt to be hiding on the planet. After wreaking havoc on the planet, they are convinced to leave by Donatello, who reveals Honeycutt's departure, only for Honeycutt to return to Earth, intending to surrender himself to the Triceratons. Honeycutt and the Turtles are abducted by the Earth Protection Force, led by Agent Bishop, who has allied with the Federation. While Traximus deposes Zanramon, Honeycutt sacrifices himself to upload a computer virus to the Triceraton and Federation fleet. Traximus jails Zanramon and Blanque and declares a new era of peace, but the damage has been done to Earth. Having observed from the sidelines, Shredder uses his Oroku Saki persona to help in the reconstruction of New York, secretly salvaging Triceraton technology for an unknown purpose, while Bishop schemes to create an army of super-soldiers. Splinter and the Turtles are visited by "Ultimate Drako", a fusion of Ue-Sama and Drako, who wield Lord Simultaneous' Time Scepter, and scatter the group across time and space. Michelangelo arrives in a world where the Turtles are superheroes fighting a villainous Splinter, Raphael enters the world of the Planet Racers franchise, Donatello suffers in an alternate timeline where the Shredder has conquered the Earth, and Leonardo arrives in Miyamoto Usagi's dimension. With Usagi's help, Leo travels to the Battle Nexus and is able to reunite his brothers and Splinter, and defeat Ultimate Drako. Though the duo are separated and Drako perishes, Ue-Sama is restored to a youthful form and reunited with his father. After receiving a vision of the Shredder departing Earth to conquer the Utrom home world, Splinter rallies the Turtles, Casey, April, Leatherhead and Honeycutt (who were revealed to have survived their supposed deaths) to storm the Shredder's stronghold on the eve of his departure in a massive spacecraft. Bishop also enters the fray with Stockman on his side, but Shredder is able to lift off with Karai and Dr. Chaplin, with the Turtles and Splinter stowing away. As Bishop continues to assault the ship in space, the Shredder viciously wounds his foes, who decide to sacrifice their lives by detonating the ship's power core to kill the Shredder. Fortunately, the Utroms arrive just in time to save them all and find the Shredder guilty of numerous war crimes and atrocities, banishing him forever to a desolate ice asteroid.

It stretches for 45 kilometers (28 mi), north of the city of Ventura, near the Topatopa Mountains, Piru, Fillmore, Santa Paula, Sulphur Springs, and Ojai. Geology[edit] The last known surface rupture was less than 5,000 years ago. Recent research indicates that the San Cayetano fault may have been the source of the December 21, 1812 earthquake. Depending on location, the fault has an estimated slip rate between 1.3–9 millimeters (0.051–0.354 in). The recurrence rate between events is uncertain, but if the fault is associated with the 1812 event, it may be able to produce earthquakes approaching 6.5 – 7.3 in magnitude.

Festival was discontinued in 2016.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Program 3 Festival jury and winners 4 Festival guests 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The first Cinema Mundi International Film Festival took place in late February, early March 2010 in Brno, Czech Republic. The inspiration for the festival came from the tradition of Brno Exhibition Centre, which was established in 1928 and since then has been attracting international exhibitors to Brno. Josef Čadík, a film fan who has been operating mobile open-air cinemas in the Czech Republic and Central Europe since 1991, established the festival in the desire to create in Brno a similar platform for the world of film. He is the current director of the festival. The main partner of the festival is the South Moravian Region whose administrative body is seated in Brno. Program[edit] In addition to screening the most recent selection of films made in Europe and the US, the festival aims at screening films representing the contemporary national cinemas of the countries of Central and South America, Africa and Asia. When selecting films from these countries in particular, the festival commission pays their special attention to the films that have been submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the United States (Oscars) for consideration in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. These films then often become a part of the main competitive section of the Cinema Mundi International Film Festival program. Additional sections of the festival include the latest Czech-language feature films and feature films that represent contemporary film art from three selected countries or a particular region. Festival jury and winners[edit] Since the second year of the festival in 2011, the Student Jury selects the best films. The Jury is formed by students of Masaryk University, the second largest university in the Czech Republic, whose students participate in the realization and organization of the festival to a great extent. Four Best Films have been chosen and six Special Awards have been bestowed by the Student Jury in the past four years: Best Film Year Film title Director Country of origin 2014 Halima's Path Arsen Anton Ostojić Croatia 2013 Blood of My Blood João Canijo Portugal 2012 As If I'm Not There Juanita Wilson Ireland 2011 Of Gods and Men Xavier Beauvois France Special Award Year Film title Director Country of origin 2014 Missing Picture Rithy Panh Cambodia 2013 Lore Cate Shortland Australia 2012 Punk's Not Dead Vladimir Blazevski Macedonia Elite Squad: The Enemy Within José Padilha Brazil 2011 Life, Above All (2010) Oliver Schmitz South Africa East, West, East: The Final Sprint Gjergj Xhuvani Albania Festival guests[edit] Since its inauguration in 2010, the Cinema Mundi International Film Festival has welcomed several accomplished guests from the world of film, including Goran Marković, director, Serbia; Srđan Karanović, director, Serbia; Lordan Zafranović, director, Croatia; İsmail Güneş, director, Turkey; Yesim Ceren Bozoglu, actress, Turkey; Iveta Grófová, director, Slovakia; João Canijo, director, Portugal; Vladimír Blazevski, director, Macedonia; Juanita Wilson, director, Ireland; Sulev Keedus, director, Estonia; Karel Roden, actor, Czech Republic; Martin Šulík, director, Slovakia; Jiří Menzel, director, Czech Republic; Hilda Hidalgo, director, Costa Rica; Jaroslav Vojtek, director, Slovakia; Anjorka Strechel, actress, Germany; Jaroslav Dušek, actor, Czech Republic; Paresh Mokashi, director, India; Miguel Littin, director, Chile; Justin Molotnikov, director, Scotland; Stephen McCole, actor, Scotland and others.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ "Filmový festival Cinema Mundi v Brně končí.

Including Hellstrom, Jennifer Kale, Morbius, Werewolf by Night, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Riders Danny Ketch and Johnny Blaze, the team first appeared in Ghost Rider (vol. 3) #28 (August 1992). From December 1993–August 1994, Marvel branded all stories involving the group with a distinct family imprint and cover treatment.

The first, "Rise of the Midnight Sons," launched several books in the Midnight Sons line,[1] including Morbius (Sept. 1992), Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins (Oct. 1992), and Nightstalkers (Nov. 1992). The group appeared in the nine-issue anthology comic book Midnight Sons Unlimited, which ran from April 1993 to May 1995. Their final crossover was the seventeen-part "Siege of Darkness" which ran from December 1993 to January 1994. It was featured in two consecutive issues of each Midnight Sons title as well as four issues of Marvel Comics Presents (#143-146), and two issues of Doctor Strange, a title that was newly included in the line. It was advertised with an eight-page insert in several comics in October, November, and December 1993. According to the text of the advertisement, written by Jeffrey Lee Simmons, For the first time in the history of Marvel, one of our family groups is getting its own distinct family imprint and cover treatment. On the outside of the books, this means all titles in the family will share a new cover symbol, the Midnight Sons dagger as well as similar cover treatments. Inside, the Midnight Sons titles will have stronger continuity, making for a more exciting, tightly knit sub-section of the Marvel Universe.[2] The advertisement also claimed the Midnight Sons was the "first distinct family group."[2] "Siege of Darkness," however, marked the cancellation of Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins, and the Midnight Sons brand did not last much longer. Nightstalkers only lasted three more issues. A Blade and Blaze series failed to catch interest. The Midnight Sons logo was eventually dropped from the remaining titles, cover-dated September 1994, although Morbius, Blade, Blaze, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider (vol. 3), Marvel Comics Presents and the final three issues of Midnight Sons Unlimited continued on under the normal Marvel logo. The Marvel Edge imprint debuted in 1995, incorporating some of the same ongoing titles as Midnight Sons, including Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme and Ghost Rider. A different incarnation of the team was featured in Marvel Zombies 3 and in Marvel Zombies 4,[3] debuting in 2008 and 2009 respectively. In February 2017, Moon Knight artist Greg Smallwood expressed interest in a revamped version of the Midnight Sons, featuring a team composed of Moon Knight, Blade, Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, and Hannibal King.[4] Fictional team biography[edit] Rise of the Midnight Sons[edit] The team was formed by Ghost Riders, Danny Ketch and Johnny Blaze after Ghost Rider received a vision in which he learned that Lilith, Mother of All Demons (not Dracula's daughter, another Marvel character of the same name) was being resurrected and posed a great threat. She planned to use her demon children, the Lilin, to take over Earth. Though Lilith had many children, she had four children who were very loyal to her. Their names were Pilgrim, Nakota, Meatmarket, and the most powerful of the four, Blackout, Ghost Rider's old enemy (Blackout was not an actual child of Lilith originally, but rather a grandchild. He was later killed and Lilith gave birth to Blackout along with her other children, thus indeed making him one of her actual children). Though she would have a lot more of her children to help her, the rest had forsaken Lilith. After she was imprisoned, many of the Lilin were either scattered or killed. Those who were scattered forgot the ways of Lilith and moved on with their lives, except Lilith's most faithful servants. The team consisted of the Nightstalkers (Eric Brooks / Blade, Frank Drake and Hannibal King), Morbius, the Living Vampire, the Spirits of Vengeance (Danny Ketch / Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider, and later Michael Badilino / Vengeance), and the Darkhold Redeemers (Sam Buchanan, Victoria Montesi, Louise Hastings, and later Modred the Mystic and Jinx). While secretly assembling the team and the sub-teams within, from behind the scenes, Doctor Strange didn't officially join the team until the Siege of Darkness storyline. Midnight Massacre[edit] The second major meeting between the Midnight Sons occurred when Blade, with a page from the Darkhold, became the demonic creature Switchblade. He killed most of the Midnight Sons, subsequently taking on the power and weapons of each. He was finally stopped when Louise Hastings used a counter spell from the Darkhold. Siege of Darkness[edit] The "Siege of Darkness" consisted of two subsequent stories in which the Midnight Sons fought groups connected with the two major villains, Lilith and Zarathos. In the first story arc, covers were black with vague outlines, and the Midnight Sons fought the Lilin who were invading the earth in a mysterious smoke emanating from Cypress Hills Cemetery. Lilin included in this arc include Bad Timing, Martine Bancroft, Blackout, Dark Legion, Meatmarket, Nakota, Outcast, Pilgrim, Sister Nil, Stonecold, and Bloodthirst, who was possessing Morbius. In the second story arc, covers featured a dripping blood design, and the Midnight Sons fought The Fallen, a group loyal to Zarathos. The Fallen include Atrocity, Embyrre, Metarchus, Patriarch, and Salomé. The Lilin[edit] At the beginning of the story, Ghost Rider and Blaze tell The Nightstalkers, The Darkhold Redeemers, and Morbius that they have killed Lilith and Zarathos. The Nightstalkers, who are skeptical, investigate but find mist containing Lilin now emanating from Cypress Hills Cemetery.[5] As the other Midnight Sons join the fight, they discover that, instead of killing Lilith and Zarathos, Ghost Rider and Blaze have opened a portal to Shadowside where the Lilin had been exiled. They split into two groups, one led by Ghost Rider and one led by Morbius. Caretaker, Doctor Strange and Vengeance also join the fight. Caretaker claims Zarathos is more powerful and they must protect the Medallion of Power. Doctor Strange teleports Ghost Rider's group to his Sanctum Sanctorum.[6] They find out from some Lilin that Morbius’ team has a traitor.[7] The team following Morbius, which includes Louise Hastings, hide out in one of Morbius’ old labs. Louise Hastings finds out Morbius has been infected by Lilin blood, and Morbius secretly kills her. Morbius has been taken over by the Lilin Bloodthirst.[8] He then requests entry into Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum. Unaware that Morbius has been possessed, Doctor Strange allows him to enter which allows other Lilin to follow. Doctor Strange convinces Morbius to fight the control of Bloodthirst.[9] Doctor Strange then casts a spell that causes the Sanctum Sanctorum to explode.[10] The Spirits of Vengeance then confront Lilith and Zarathos in Cypress Hills Cemetery and use the Medallion of Power to send Lilith and the Lilin back to Shadowside. The Medallion of Power disappears.[11] The Fallen[edit] After Lilith is exiled, it appears as if a group called The Fallen, loyal to Zarathos, has returned from exile. The Fallen are an offshoot of The Blood, the group to which Caretaker belongs. The Fallen left The Blood to follow the wizard Zarathos. The Fallen quickly beat the Midnight Sons and take Caretaker captive.[12] The Midnight Sons regroup at The Nightclub, and Caretaker sends a message that The Fallen plan to recruit or kill surviving members of The Blood.[13] The Midnight Sons then find James Raydar, Patriarch and Truthsayer with varying degrees of success; Patriarch joins Zarathos, Truthsayer is killed by Modred, and James Raydar joins the Midnight Sons along with Embyrre, Raydar's daughter and one of The Fallen who turns against Zarathos when she sees Morbius’ nobility.[13][14][15] Meanwhile, Victoria Montesi finds out that she has been impregnated with Chthon.[16] Doctor Strange helps her just as he is being attacked by Salomé, one of The Fallen, who claims she is the rightful Sorceress Supreme. Doctor Strange disappears into another dimension and places Victoria Montesi in a mystical stasis. In his place appears Strange, a mystical construct Doctor Strange based loosely on himself. Strange joins the rest of the Midnight Sons in the fight against The Fallen.[10] Ghost Rider confronts Zarathos one on one, and Ghost Rider is apparently destroyed and his power absorbed into Zarathos.[17] The Midnight Sons then fight Patriarch, Metarchus, and Atrocity to a standstill, and the Fallen retreat. Caretaker reveals that there is one more member of The Blood they have not contacted, Foundry. The Midnight Sons track down Foundry who gives them a sword called Justiciar. She claims it must be tempered in her own blood and sacrifices herself. Blade then uses Justiciar to kill Patriarch, Metarchus and Atrocity with the help of the other Midnight Sons. They believe the destruction of The Fallen will weaken Zarathos. They attack Zarathos directly. Embyrre and James Raydar also attack and are killed. Ghost Rider, whose spirit was absorbed by Zarathos, now apparently attacks him from within and Blade stabs Zarathos with Justiciar. Zarathos, with the sword through his chest, turns to stone. Johnny Blaze, Vengeance, Morbius, Blade, Hannibal King, Strange, and Caretaker then go through a ceremony in which they are branded with the symbol of the flaming dagger. Caretaker says they have become the successors to the original 'Order of the Midnight Sons' This brand is placed on the arms of all the members of the new team aside from Frank Drake, a member of the Nightstalkers and a human descendant of Dracula and the Ghost Rider who had apparently been destroyed. Drake was disallowed from taking the brand due to his relative normalcy compared to the other members who were supernaturally afflicted and destined to be outsiders. He was allowed, however, to be an associate member.[18] Marvel Zombies[edit] See also: Marvel Zombies (series) A new Midnight Sons team is sanctioned by A.R.M.O.R., a government agency that monitors and polices alternate realities from Earth-616. The team is chosen by Morbius, who enlists Daimon "Hellstorm" Hellstrom (aka; the Son of Satan), Jennifer Kale, Man-Thing, and Werewolf by Night to contain the zombie virus outbreak from further spreading into the 616 universe. The team makes a brief appearance at the end of Marvel Zombies 3 and fully appears in Marvel Zombies 4. Damnation[edit] During the Damnation storyline, Wong and the ghost of Doctor Strange's dog Bats assembled Blade, Doctor Voodoo, Elsa Bloodstone, Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, and Man-Thing to form the latest incarnation of the Midnight Sons so that they could help Doctor Strange fight Mephisto's forces in Las Vegas.[19] In other media[edit] Video games[edit] The Midnight Sons appear in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order with Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze) and Elsa Bloodstone as playable characters. Morbius the Living Vampire also appears in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order though as part of the Marvel Knights DLC pack alongside the Punisher, Blade and Moon Knight.

Born in Argentina, he emigrated in 1964 to Puerto Rico,[3] where he was raised and studied. Later in his life, he emigrated to the United States, where he resides to this day and works for Autodesk. Earlier in his career, in the 1980s, he programmed dedicated chess computers for SciSys and Saitek. In the early 1990s he collaborated on the chess program Socrates.[4] Contents 1 Chessplayer 2 Software developer 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Chessplayer[edit] Kaplan was born in Argentina. His chess coach was Jacobo Bolbochán.[5] In 1967, he was the Puerto Rico National Chess Champion and, in addition, he won the World Junior Chess Championship in Jerusalem, followed by the well-known Raymond Keene, Jan Timman, Robert Hübner, among others. This victory earned Kaplan the International Master title. In 1968, he tied for 6–9th in Málaga. In 1969, he took 4th in Stockholm (World Junior Championship, Anatoly Karpov won). In 1969, he tied for 8–9th in San Juan (Boris Spassky won). In 1970, he won the 6th El Segundo Open, the 6th Monterey International Open, and the 2nd Central California Championship, held in Hayward. In 1971, he won the 22nd Annual California Open, held in Fresno. In 1973, he took 8th in São Paulo (Ostojic won). In 1973, he tied for 12–14th in Madrid (Karpov won). In 1974, he tied for 2nd–3rd with Florin Gheorghiu, behind Svetozar Gligorić, in Los Angeles. Kaplan played for the Puerto Rico National Chess Team in four Chess Olympiads. In 1966, at second reserve board in 17th Olympiad in Havana (+6 –4 =4) In 1968, at first board in 18th Chess Olympiad in Lugano (+1 –1 =4) In 1970, at first board in 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen (+5 –1 =7) In 1972, at first board in 20th Chess Olympiad in Skopje (+7 –1 =9).

He won the individual gold medal at Örebro 1966, and the team silver medal at Caracas 1976. Software developer[edit] Kaplan had always been interested in computer chess throughout his career, and this led him to found Heuristic Software Corporation[6], whose first development was Heuristic Alpha in 1990–91,[7] which eventually evolved into Socrates and later Socrates II. Socrates II was one of the corporation's most successful programs, winning the 1993 ACM International Chess Championship[8] after defeating opponents with special-purposed hardware and software for playing chess, like HiTech[9] and Cray Blitz[10], even though Socrates II ran on a stock 486 PC. These achievements drew Electronic Arts's attention, and the company proceeded to hire Kaplan's development team to develop Kasparov's Gambit, incorporating former world chess champion Garry Kasparov as brand name and adviser.[11] Kasparov's Gambit was the first and sole effort of Electronic Arts to enter the chess market.

A large South American grasshopper, it is also known as the blue-winged grasshopper although they vary greatly in coloration.[1] It is common in both forests and dry areas of South America from Colombia to Argentina. In parts of northern Argentina, they are considered a pest.[2] They are also popular among insect and terrarium enthusiasts.[3] A grasshopper of this species was spotted landing on the arm of James Rodríguez, after he scored a goal during Colombia's 2–1 defeat to Brazil, at the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[4][5] References[edit] ^ Carbonell, Carlos S.
