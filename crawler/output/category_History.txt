It was released through Pony Canyon's Flight Master imprint on August 28, 2002. The first pressing of the single included a DVD featuring the music video for "Pureness" and a special video message from Ueto. Contents 1 Background 2 Live performances 3 Chart performance 4 Track listing 5 Charts 6 Sales 7 Release history 8 References Background[edit] After the disbandment of Z-1, Ueto signed with Pony Canyon to debut as a solo artist.[1] Ueto initially declined the offer, but was persuaded by her talent agency. Her first single was scheduled for a May release, however, with Seiko Matsuda's daughter, Sayaka Kanda, also debuting around the same time, her management team decided to push back Ueto's debut and "Pureness" was subsequently postponed to August 2002. "Pureness" was chosen by Ueto and her team out of 600 songs.[1] The song was written, composed, arranged and produced by T2ya. The look for the single's artwork and music video was based on Ueto's breakthrough role of Nao Tsurumoto on the TBS drama series 3-nen B-gumi Kinpachi-sensei.[2] Live performances[edit] On August 28, 2002, Ueto held a special event to commemorate her debut. The promotional event, held at Zepp Tokyo, attracted over 2,000 fans. Due to overwhelming fan demand, a second event took place at Zepp Osaka on September 15, 2002. Ueto's first televised performance of "Pureness" was on the NHK music program Pop Jam Summer Special. She also performed the song on Utaban and Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ. Ueto sang the song on live television on Music Station, as well as at their year-end concert Music Station Super Live 2002. Chart performance[edit] "Pureness" entered the daily Oricon Singles Chart at number 5.[3] The single rose to number-one on August 31, 2002.[4] It peaked at number 4 on the weekly chart, with 46,000 copies sold in the first week,[5] becoming the first debut single with no commercial tie-in by a female solo artist to reach the top five in over three years, since Kyoko Fukada's "Saigo no Kajitsu" (1999), which also debuted at number 4 and was coincidentally released by the same label.[6] The single held onto the top ten on its second week, selling 20,000 copies.[7] It fell to number 16 next,[8] then number 18,[9] dropping off from the top twenty on its fifth week.[10] "Pureness" charted for eight weeks on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling a reported total of 96,000 copies during its run.[11] Track listing[edit] No.TitleWriter(s)Arranger(s)Length1."Pureness"T2yaT2ya4:062."Breath of My Heart"Yōji KubotaMiki WatabeChokkaku3:593."Puzzle"Natsumi KobayashiShinichirō MurayamaMurayama3:424."Pureness" (Instrumental)T2yaT2ya4:02Total length:15:49 First press DVDNo.TitleDirector(s)Length1."Pureness" (Video Clip)Takehito Kobayashi 2."Pureness" (Making) 3."Message" Charts[edit] Chart (2002) Peakposition Japan Daily Singles (Oricon)[4] 1 Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)[12] 4 Japan Monthly Singles (Oricon)[13] 10 Japan Weekly Singles (SoundScan) (CD+DVD)[14] 7 Japan Weekly Singles (SoundScan) (CD only)[15] 15 Sales[edit] Region Certification Certified units/sales Japan (RIAJ) N/A 96,000[11] *sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alone Release history[edit] Region Date Format(s) Label Ref.

It then goes east as a narrow, curvy, 2-lane highway as it goes through Midway and then some mountains before entering Paint Rock and having a junction with SR 322, a loop route through Sweetwater. It stays curvy as it crosses more mountains and enters Loudon County. Loudon County[edit] It then begins paralleling the Tennessee River as it enters Loudon, and finally leaves the mountains and curves behind. SR 72 then has an interchange with I-75 before going through Loudon's main business district and having a junction with US 11/SR 2. It then bypasses downtown to the south before leaving Loudon and the Tennessee River to turn and go southeast. After that, it goes through farmland and has an intersection with SR 444 (Tellico Parkway), which provides access to Tellico Village, Tellico Lake, and Lenoir City. Monroe and Blount Counties[edit] SR 72 then crosses into Monroe County and enters Vonore, intersects with the other end of SR 322, and comes to an intersection with US 411/SR 33.

William W. Grigsby (February 13, 1922 – February 26, 2011)[1] was an American sportscaster and member of the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. Grigsby was best known for his work with the Kansas City Chiefs. Contents 1 Personal life 2 Professional career 3 Failing health 4 Honors 5 References 6 External links Personal life[edit] Bill Grigsby was born in Wellsville, Kansas in 1922, the youngest of three sons of Harry Ludwell Grigsby and Elanore Amelia Grigsby. His father was a geologist, frequently unemployed during the Great Depression so the family moved to Lawrence, Kansas when Bill was in third grade.[2] After graduating from the University of Kansas, Grigsby served three years in the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during World War II as a cryptographer.[3] He married wife Frances in 1949 and they would have five children: three sons and two daughters. Professional career[edit] Following his discharge from the USAAF Grigsby took a job with the Joplin Globe newspaper in Joplin, Missouri, advancing from copy boy to sports reporter.[4] It was while in Joplin he began his first foray into broadcasting, serving as play-by-play voice of the Joplin Miners minor-league baseball team. In 1957 Grigsby returned to his alma mater to broadcast Kansas Jayhawks football and basketball games. While at KU, Grigsby broadcast the first nationally-televised NCAA Final Four game as Kansas lost to North Carolina in triple overtime.[5] Bill Grigsby began his long association with the Kansas City sports scene in 1959 when he was hired as part of the Kansas City Athletics broadcasting team. The Kansas City Chiefs hired Grigsby in 1963 and he would remain a fixture of game broadcasts until his retirement in 2009. His trademark, no matter the weather, "It's a bea-youuu-tiful day for Chiefs football" endeared him to generations of Chiefs fans. Other work included broadcast and management duties with the Kansas City Scouts of the NHL, local commercial voiceovers, and even a brief stint as a wrestling promoter.[6] Grigsby published the first of two books, Grigs! A beauuutiful Life in 2004, followed by Don't Spit in the Wastebasket, a collection of sports memories, in 2005. Grigsby also contributed a weekly general sports column up to the time of his death for "The Parkville Luminary" newspaper. Failing health[edit] Grigsby suffered a heart attack in October 2003 which caused him to miss several broadcasts.[7] It was also during that decade he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. When the Chiefs honored Grigsby with a special ceremony in September 2010, Grigsby was seen in a wheelchair. Bill Grigsby died of prostate cancer on February 26, 2011 at the age of 89. Honors[edit] Grigsby was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. Inducted into the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Hall of Fame in 1991. Grigsby Field, a community baseball field in Parkville, Missouri was named in his honor in 2002.[8] In 2007, a life-size statue of Bill Grigsby was erected at the National Golf Club of Kansas City in Parkville.[9] It was relocated to downtown Parkville in 2017, Grigsby's residence since 1974.

The party collecting the tax is presumed to hold it in trust for the benefit of the government to whom it is due. A trust-fund tax is a type of tax or debt where (absent a personal guarantee) the management or responsible employees of a corporation or other entity with limited liability can be held personally liable for its non-payment. Trust-fund taxes include fuel taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, and certain payroll taxes. Generally, any tax required to be withheld from an employee's paycheck (or required to be matched by the employer and additionally paid) for which the employee is liable for (or employer, for matching contributions), such as the employee (and employer) portion of the United States Social Security and Medicare taxes, and any tax a merchant is required to collect from a customer, can be considered trust-fund taxes. A trust-fund tax has the special characteristic that if it is owed by a business entity such as a corporation or LLC, the management of the business entity can be held personally liable for payment of the tax if the entity fails to do so. The presumption is that the entity was supposed to withhold employee-owed payroll taxes or customer-owed sales taxes, and set those funds aside from the general funds of the entity, and not allow those funds to be spent for any purpose except payment of the trust-fund tax. Thus, in effect, failing to pay a trust-fund tax is considered the equivalent of management embezzling the funds that were due, and being personally liable for non-payment. Additionally, an employee with authority to sign checks for a business can also be held liable for non-payment of trust-fund taxes if they knew or should have known the business was liable for the tax, even if the business' owner instructed them not to pay the tax. Note that the prime characteristic of a tax being considered a trust-fund tax is that it was collected (or was supposed to be collected) from a third party, and failure to pay a trust fund tax by an entity allows the taxing authority to optionally look to the managers, responsible employees and potentially owners of the entity for the unpaid taxes. For example, if a corporation goes bankrupt, owing $100,000 in income tax, the managers of a business entity (corporation, limited liability company, etc.) have no personal liability for this tax (it is owed by the entity on its own), but if it owed $500 in sales taxes the government to whom it is due can go after management as a personal liability for the tax (the entity was supposed to collect the tax in trust for that government, segregate the funds until due and pay it). In some cases non-payment of trust fund taxes can be more serious than non-payment of income or other taxes. In California, for example, it is a misdemeanor for the management of a business entity to willfully fail to remit trust-fund taxes such as any withholding from an employee's wages made pursuant to a state or local law, and if the amount of tax due exceeds $500 the class of crime becomes a felony (see California Labor Code Section 227). On the other hand, income tax evasion is punishable with a fine and/or imprisonment (see California Revenue and Taxation Code section 19706).

It debuted for a Welsh audience, but in 2003, it started being broadcast in the market in the United Kingdom. It originally featured a child named Owen (portrayed by David Bursey) and three characters who lived in his hat: inanimate when he was present, but active when he was out. This aspect of the series was later dropped; the characters were then active (in cartoon form) from the beginning of the programme. The three main characters play in a band. In most episodes, they would try to solve a problem, then perform a song about it at the end. At one point in the episode, they would obtain a clue to the problem's solution by looking through their "bobinoculars", which show video footage from the real world.

It held the naming rights to the Seattle Mariners' baseball stadium Safeco Field from its opening in 1999 through the end of the 2018 season.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Acquisitions 3 Restructuring 4 Liberty Mutual Insurance 5 Philanthropy 6 Notes 7 References 8 External links History[edit] Safeco was founded in Seattle, Washington, in 1923 by Hawthorne K. Dent as the General Insurance Company of America, a property and casualty insurer. This name is still used by Safeco on some of its insurance products.[note 1] Thirty years later the company founded the Selective Auto and Fire Ensurance Company of America, or SAFECO (i.e., S.A.F.E. Co.).[citation needed] General Insurance's first headquarters were in downtown Seattle at the corner of University Street and Fourth Avenue. In 1936, it moved to the eight-story Brooklyn Building at the corner of N.E. 45th Street and Brooklyn Avenue N.E. in the University District.[citation needed] General Insurance began to sell life insurance in 1957. Eleven years later the corporate name changed from the General Insurance Company of America to Safeco Corporation. (The company would end up changing the capitalization of its name from SAFECO to Safeco at the turn of the century.) Around the same time the company began to offer mutual funds and commercial credit (though precursors to the Safeco Funds had been around since the 1930s).[citation needed] Safeco replaced the Brooklyn Building with the 22-story Safeco Plaza building in 1973. It remains the tallest building in the city outside Downtown.[2] Acquisitions[edit] In 1997, Safeco bought American States Financial Corporation to expand beyond the West Coast. Washington Mutual's WM Life Insurance Company was purchased the same year. Two years later Safeco bought R.F. Bailey (Underwriting Agencies) Limited of London.[citation needed] Restructuring[edit] In 2001, new management was brought in to restructure the company. Commercial credit operations were sold to General Electric in 2001, and on March 15, 2004, the company announced the sale of its most profitable division, the life insurance and investments business, to a group of private investors led by Safeco board members and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd., incorporating as Symetra Financial Corporation. The same day, it was announced that Hub International Ltd. was buying Safeco's insurance brokerage operations. Less than a month later, on April 12, it was announced that Mellon Financial Corporation would buy Safeco Trust Company, whose business is providing financial and estate planning services to individuals with over $1 million in assets. On August 2, the closure of Safeco Asset Management, the mutual-fund business, was announced.[citation needed] The former Safeco Plaza, now UW Tower The current Safeco Plaza, originally the Seafirst Building. On April 6, 2005, CEO Mike McGavick announced that Safeco would be consolidating operations at either the University District "home office" campus or the newer Eastside campus in Redmond, pending a competition between Microsoft and the University of Washington for the sale of one or the other location. On January 19, 2006, it was announced that Microsoft would purchase the Redmond campus for $209.5 million.[3] Plans were announced for a new 125 feet (38 m) office tower across the street from Safeco Plaza to house the approximately 1,300 Redmond employees.[4] However, McGavick subsequently stepped down as CEO to run for the U.S. Senate.[5] In a surprise move, his replacement Paula Rosput Reynolds announced on August 30, 2006, that the entire University District complex would be sold as well, to the University of Washington for $130 million.[6] Employees were told they would be moved to leased space in downtown Seattle. Some speculated this signalled the imminent sale of the company, although Safeco denied this. Safeco moved back downtown in 2007; its new headquarters at 1001 Fourth Avenue became the new Safeco Plaza, and the old Safeco Plaza was renamed UW Tower.[7] Liberty Mutual Insurance[edit] On April 23, 2008, Safeco announced an agreement to be acquired by Liberty Mutual for $68.25 per share.[8] Safeco continues to offer personal lines insurance (including auto, home, motorcycle, recreational vehicle, watercraft and more) through independent agents [9] Philanthropy[edit] On February 12, 2010, Safeco announced its donation of more than 800 pieces of its Safeco Art Collection to the Washington Art Consortium.

It frequents both slow and moderate rivers, as well as canals and still waters of various kinds. This species is referred to as the common chub, European chub, or simply chub.[2] Contents 1 Description 2 Distribution 3 Habitat and ecology 4 Threats 5 Fishing for chub 5.1 Tackle and tactics 6 References 7 External links Description[edit] It is a stocky fish with a large rounded head. Its body is long and cylindrical in shape and is covered in large greenish-brown scales which are edged with narrow bands of black across the back, paling to golden on the flanks and even paler on the belly. The tail is dark brown or black, the dorsal fin is a greyish-green in colour and all the other fins being are orange-red.[3] The dorsal fin has 3 spines and 7-9 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7-10 rays. The vertebrae count is 42-48. It can grow to 60 cm standard length but most fish are around 30 cm.[2] Distribution[edit] The chub is distributed throughout most of northern Eurasia, it can be found in the rivers flowing into the North, Baltic, northern Black, White, Barents and Caspian Sea basins, the Atlantic basins south to Adour drainage in France and in Great Britain north to 56 °C, in Scandinavia in southern Finland and southern Sweden north to around Stockholm. In the Mediterranean basin it is found in France from the Var to the Hérault, and may also be present in the Aude, drainages.[2] It is absent as a native species from Ireland and Italy but has been introduced to both countries[4]; in Italy S. cephalus is present and acclimatised since decades, but it seems marginally found here and there (mainly in the Po river basin), never forming well established populations. Habitat and ecology[edit] It is most abundant in small rivers and large streams in the "barbel zone" where there are riffles and pools. It occurs along the banks of slow-flowing lowland rivers in large lake and even in mountain streams. Chub in lakes undertake spawning migrations into inflowing streams. The adult fish are solitary but the juvenile fish are sociable and occur in shoals. The larvae and juveniles prefer rather shallow habitats along shorelines and these smaller fish have a varied diet of aquatic and terrestrial animals[5] while the large, solitary adults prey mainly on freshwater shrimp and small fishes.[6][2] In the United Kingdom, chub have been recorded feeding on worms, molluscs, crustaceans, and various insect larvae while large chub eat considerable numbers of small fish, such as chub, eels, common dace, common roach, gudgeon and minnows as well as frogs, crayfish, voles and young water birds.[4] They have also been observed eating berries such as blackberries[7] and elderberry from trees overhanging the water. They feed throughout the year if there are opportunities, even in the coldest days of midwinter.[3] Scales taken from chub Spawning happens when the water temperature reaches 14 °C, and lasts from May to September.[4] They spawn in fast-flowing water above gravel substrates but only infrequently will they spawn among submerged vegetation. The females spawn more than once during a season and each female will mate with several males. The males aggregate at spawning sites and will follow the ripe females, often with much splashing, to shallow riffles. Females lay pale yellow sticky eggs which adhere to the gravel, weed and stones in flowing water.[2] Sexual maturity in chub is influenced by environmental factors with males reaching sexual maturity at the age of 2–4 years while females reach it at 4-6 although some individuals may mature much later than this.[4] The fish can live for up to 22 years in the wild[8], where the age of fish can be assessed through by the number of rings that are visible in scales, these represent seasonal growth patterns. Threats[edit] Recent work has shown that chub ingest microplastic particles. Whereas many as 25% of sampled fish contained particles, these particles were not found in muscles.[9]. Many of the particles found were fibres, that are released from clothes during washing, these are also ingested by macroinvertebrates such as Daphnia[10]. Chub can also be contaminated by metal pollution such as copper, magnesium and sodium which can accumulate in tissues like the muscle, gills and liver.[11] Young of the year fish contained particularly high levels of metal contaminants[11].

Small chub are freely biting fish which even inexperienced anglers find easy to catch. As they become larger, however, chub become more wary and are easily spooked by noise or visual disturbance. Consequently, large chub (in excess of 2 kg) are keenly sought by anglers who prefer to target specific fish. The British angling record for chub was broken in May 2007 when Steve White caught a 4.2-kg (9.2-lb) fish from a southern stillwater on a mainline boilie.[12] The chub can reach a maximum length of 60–80 cm (24-31.5 in). German chub catch from the typical environment Tackle and tactics[edit] Smaller chub are not too difficult to catch and on small or medium-sized rivers, a stick-float fishing approach can be adopted or even a swim-feeder and using almost any bait including maggots, luncheon meat, sweetcorn and even small lures and flies. Chub also eat marine derived fishmeal-based pellets and diets of wild chub diets contain 44% of these pellets[6]. Catching the larger specimens however requires a patient and stealthy approach as most larger chub are caught on the smaller, clearer rivers and as a result, the angler must make their presence as subtle as possible and yet again, not a lot of tackle is required and most anglers may even set their tackle up before they get their favored spot as there is less noise from tackle being set up that may disturb the fish. A classic chub spot is just hanging off (or even inside) branches/bushes brushing through the water as chub are quite sensitive to sunlight and most anglers may fish at sunrise or sunset when the chub leave their entangled home. An angler should also look for where the current is being pushed out, causing a re-circulation pattern behind what ever is pushing the current outwards and this is where much food will wash around and where there will probably be feeding fish. Like with the smaller chub, a range of baits can be used but smaller baits such as maggots may attract small fish like minnows (especially on smaller rivers) so a larger bait such as luncheon meat is best used. In terms of the line setup, line ratings of a range of 4-8 pounds breaking-strain is ideal, less experienced anglers should use the tougher rating until they have gained knowledge about 'playing' the fish. Feeder/ledger fishing Traditionally a quiver-tip rod is used with at least four-pound line rating due to the weight of the ledger/feeder (heavier weights need heavier line). In feeder fishing, bait will be put on a hook or a hair rig and inside a swim-feeder which the current will cause to flow out and attract fish to the hook's position so it involves fishing upstream of where the fish are, this usually involves smaller baits like sweetcorn or maggots. The same applies to ledgering except there is a weight (called a ledger) instead of a swim-feeder and usually heavier baits are used here such as luncheon meat. Another method known as touch-ledgering can be used which involves not using a quiver-tip but instead holding the line that is loose off the reel and feeling for any pulls or the line going loose. Some anglers do this without any weights and let the bait slowly drift downstream with the line steadily moving through their hands, slugs and luncheon meat are excellent for this method. Float fishing This method could involve fishing under the rod-tip in deep water or letting the float gently drift to where the fish may be situated (known as trotting) whilst throwing portions of bait in the stream to encourage feeding. Usually a lighter rod may be used (no more than ten-foot) and sometimes a centrepin reel is used as it allows the line to smoothly come off the reel. Anglers must strike quickly when trotting as bites can be easy to miss sometimes. Drifting baits such as bread, sweetcorn and maggots are usually used here. Lure fishing This method is usually for the larger chub, a light spinning/lure rod with a fixed-spool reel of at least 10 pounds line rating as it is easy to snag onto debris when doing this method. Small lures such as bar-spoons and spoons or even small soft-plastics can imitate the smaller fish such as minnows that the larger chub feed on. Fly-fishing Using flies such as damselfly patterns or even larger, dark patterns such as those that imitate slugs can be very good if presented correctly. More obvious, shiny flies that imitate small fish may work for more aggressive chub, this method is all-year but best in warmer months. Nymph patterns also do well. References[edit] ^ a b Freyhof, J.

In 2007, the car did not race and the car and design/copyright was acquired by Litespeed F3 owners Nino Singh Judge and Steve Kenchington. The car was converted from an Opel to Honda engine over the winter and early part of 2008. It made its race debut at Snetterton in Norfolk in June 2008 and despite no testing was pretty much on the pace driven by Callum MacLeod but suffered expected teething problems. On only its second outing at Brands Hatch in Kent the car finished 2nd driven by Jonathan Legris. This was the breakthrough the Litespeed F3 team were looking for and now hope for a win by the end of 2008 and for a Championship victory in 2009. F1 entry[edit] Litespeed announced its intention to enter Formula One under the 2010 season's budget cap regulations. The team employed MGI Ltd., a company owned by former F1 designer Mike Gascoyne, in order to achieve this goal.[1] When the budget cap was abolished the Malaysian backed team Lotus Racing negotiated with Litespeed to obtain their entry and enter under the Lotus Racing team name, who confirmed the continuing involvement of Mike Gascoyne.[2] References[edit] ^ Elizalde, Pablo; Beer, Matt (14 May 2009).

It began on 20 September and ended on 27 September. Rising power Brazil topped the group, comfortably beating South Korea and Norway by large margins and were denied a 100% record by Marinette Pichon's last minute equalizer against France. Brazil were joined in the second round by Norway, who won their other two games against France and South Korea, both which were making their debut at the World Cup.

It uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos.[16] It can also be used to make one-to-one voice and video calls,[17][18] and the Android version can optionally function as an SMS app.[19] Signal uses standard cellular telephone numbers as identifiers and secures all communications to other Signal users with end-to-end encryption. The apps include mechanisms by which users can independently verify the identity of their contacts and the integrity of the data channel.[19][20] All Signal software is free and open-source. Its clients are published under the GPLv3 license,[12][13][14] while the server code is published under the AGPLv3 license.[15] The non-profit Signal Foundation was launched in February 2018 with initial funding of $50 million.[21] Contents 1 History 1.1 2010–2013: Origins 1.2 2013–2018: Open Whisper Systems 1.3 2018–present: Signal Messenger 2 Features 3 Limitations 3.1 Android-specific 3.2 Desktop-specific 4 Usability 5 Architecture 5.1 Encryption protocols 5.1.1 Authentication 5.2 Servers 5.2.1 Contact discovery 5.2.2 Metadata 5.2.3 Federation 5.3 Licensing 5.4 Distribution 6 Reception 6.1 Blocking 7 Developers and funding 8 See also 9 References 10 Bibliography 11 Further reading 12 External links History[edit] Signal TimelineMay 2010Moxie Marlinspike and Stuart Anderson (Whisper Systems) launch TextSecure and RedPhone on Android.[22]Nov 2011Whisper Systems is acquired by Twitter,[23] "primarily so that Mr. Marlinspike could help the then-startup improve its security."[24]Dec 2011 – Jul 2012TextSecure and RedPhone are released as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license.[25][26]Jan 2013Moxie Marlinspike leaves Twitter and founds Open Whisper Systems (OWS) as a collaborative open source project for the continued development of TextSecure and RedPhone.[27][28]Feb 2014OWS adds end-to-end encrypted group chat and instant messaging capabilities to TextSecure.[29]Jul 2014OWS releases Signal as a RedPhone counterpart for iOS.[1][30]Mar 2015OWS discontinues support for encrypted SMS/MMS messaging in TextSecure, while retaining its encrypted IM capabilities.[31] At the same time, OWS adds encrypted IM to Signal on iOS.[32]Nov 2015RedPhone is merged into TextSecure on Android and the app is renamed as Signal.[33]Dec 2015Signal Desktop is launched as a Chrome App.[34]Oct 2017OWS announces the deprecation of their Chrome App and the release of a new Electron-based Signal Desktop.[35]Mar 2017OWS transitions Signal's calling system from RedPhone to WebRTC and adds the ability to make video calls with the mobile apps.[36][17]Feb 2018Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton launch the Signal Foundation with an initial $50 million in funding from Acton, who had left WhatsApp's parent company Facebook in September 2017.[37][21]Nov 2019 – Feb 2020Signal adds support for iPads,[38] view-once images and videos, stickers, and reactions.[39] They also announce plans for a new group messaging system and an "experimental method for storing encrypted contacts in the cloud."[39]Aug 2020 – Sep 2020Signal adds message requests[40] and one-to-one voice and video calling to Signal Desktop.[41][42]vte The end-to-end encrypted messaging service Signal was launched in 2014, and has become more widely used in 2019 and 2020. Signal’s growth has often spiked during "periods in which decisions are questioned or undone—to moments of social and political upheaval".[43] However, the roots of Signal go back to earlier encrypted voice and text apps of the early 2010s. 2010–2013: Origins[edit] Signal is the successor of the RedPhone encrypted voice calling app and the TextSecure encrypted texting program. The beta versions of RedPhone and TextSecure were first launched in May 2010 by Whisper Systems,[22] a startup company co-founded by security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson.[44][45] Whisper Systems also produced a firewall and tools for encrypting other forms of data.[44][46] All of these were proprietary enterprise mobile security software and were only available for Android. In November 2011, Whisper Systems announced that it had been acquired by Twitter. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed by either company.[23] The acquisition was done "primarily so that Mr. Marlinspike could help the then-startup improve its security".[24] Shortly after the acquisition, Whisper Systems' RedPhone service was made unavailable.[47] Some criticized the removal, arguing that the software was "specifically targeted [to help] people under repressive regimes" and that it left people like the Egyptians in "a dangerous position" during the events of the Egyptian revolution of 2011.[48] Twitter released TextSecure as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license in December 2011.[44][49][25][50] RedPhone was also released under the same license in July 2012.[26] Marlinspike later left Twitter and founded Open Whisper Systems as a collaborative Open Source project for the continued development of TextSecure and RedPhone.[1][28] 2013–2018: Open Whisper Systems[edit] Open Whisper Systems' website was launched in January 2013.[28] In February 2014, Open Whisper Systems introduced the second version of their TextSecure Protocol (now Signal Protocol), which added end-to-end encrypted group chat and instant messaging capabilities to TextSecure.[29] Toward the end of July 2014, they announced plans to merge the RedPhone and TextSecure applications as Signal.[51] This announcement coincided with the initial release of Signal as a RedPhone counterpart for iOS. The developers said that their next steps would be to provide TextSecure instant messaging capabilities for iOS, unify the RedPhone and TextSecure applications on Android, and launch a web client.[51] Signal was the first iOS app to enable easy, strongly encrypted voice calls for free.[1][30] TextSecure compatibility was added to the iOS application in March 2015.[52][32] Signal Android icon, 2015–2017Signal icon, 2015–2020 From its launch in May 2010[22] until March 2015, the Android version of Signal (then called TextSecure) included support for encrypted SMS/MMS messaging.[53] From version 2.7.0 onward, the Android application only supported sending and receiving encrypted messages via the data channel.[54] Reasons for this included security flaws of SMS/MMS and problems with the key exchange.[54] Open Whisper Systems' abandonment of SMS/MMS encryption prompted some users to create a fork named Silence (initially called SMSSecure[55]) that is meant solely for the exchange of encrypted SMS and MMS messages.[56][57] In November 2015, the TextSecure and RedPhone applications on Android were merged to become Signal for Android.[33] A month later, Open Whisper Systems announced Signal Desktop, a Chrome app that could link with a Signal mobile client.[34] At launch, the app could only be linked with the Android version of Signal.[58] On September 26, 2016, Open Whisper Systems announced that Signal Desktop could now be linked with the iOS version of Signal as well.[59] On October 31, 2017, Open Whisper Systems announced that the Chrome app was deprecated.[10] At the same time, they announced the release of a standalone desktop client (based on the Electron framework[14]) for Windows, MacOS and certain Linux distributions.[10][60] On October 4, 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Open Whisper Systems published a series of documents revealing that OWS had received a subpoena requiring them to provide information associated with two phone numbers for a federal grand jury investigation in the first half of 2016.[61][62][63] Only one of the two phone numbers was registered on Signal, and because of how the service is designed, OWS was only able to provide "the time the user's account had been created and the last time it had connected to the service".[62][61] Along with the subpoena, OWS received a gag order requiring OWS not to tell anyone about the subpoena for one year.[61] OWS approached the ACLU, and they were able to lift part of the gag order after challenging it in court.[61] OWS said it was the first time they had received a subpoena, and that they were committed to treat "any future requests the same way".[63] In March 2017, Open Whisper Systems transitioned Signal's calling system from RedPhone to WebRTC, also adding the ability to make video calls with the mobile apps.[36][64][17] 2018–present: Signal Messenger[edit] On February 21, 2018, Moxie Marlinspike and WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton announced the formation of the Signal Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is "to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal’s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous."[37][21] The foundation was started with an initial $50 million in funding from Acton, who had left WhatsApp's parent company Facebook in September 2017.[21] According to the announcement, Acton is the foundation's executive chairman and Marlinspike continues as the CEO of Signal Messenger.[37] By 2020, Signal runs totally on donations, as a nonprofit.[43] Between November 2019 and February 2020, Signal added support for iPads, view-once images and videos, stickers, and reactions.[39] They also announced plans for a new group messaging system and an "experimental method for storing encrypted contacts in the cloud."[39] Signal was reportedly popularized in the United States during the George Floyd protests. As U.S. protests gained momentum, on June 3, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted a recommendation for users to download Signal Messenger.[65] Heightened awareness of police monitoring led protesters to use the app to communicate. Black Lives Matter organizers had used the app "for several years".[66][43] During the first week of June, the encrypted messaging app was downloaded over five times more than it had been during the week prior to the death of George Floyd.[66] In June 2020, Signal Foundation announced a new feature that enables users to blur faces in photos, in response to increased federal efforts to monitor protesters.[43][67] Features[edit] Signal allows users to make one-to-one voice and video[17] calls to other Signal users on iOS, Android, and desktop.[18] All calls are made over a Wi-Fi or data connection and (with the exception of data fees) are free of charge, including long distance and international.[30] Signal also allows users to send text messages, files,[16] voice notes, pictures, GIFs,[68] and video messages over a Wi-Fi or data connection to other Signal users on iOS, Android and a desktop app. The app also supports group messaging. All communications to other Signal users are automatically end-to-end encrypted. The keys that are used to encrypt the user's communications are generated and stored at the endpoints (i.e. by users, not by servers).[69] To verify that a correspondent is really the person that they claim to be, Signal users can compare key fingerprints (or scan QR codes) out-of-band.[70] The app employs a trust-on-first-use mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent's key changes.[70] On Android, users can opt into making Signal the default SMS/MMS application, allowing them to send and receive unencrypted SMS messages in addition to the standard end-to-end encrypted Signal messages.[29] Users can then use the same application to communicate with contacts who do not have Signal.[29] Sending a message unencrypted is also available as an override between Signal users.[71] TextSecure allowed the user to set a passphrase that encrypted the local message database and the user's encryption keys.[72] This did not encrypt the user's contact database or message timestamps.[72] The Signal applications on Android and iOS can be locked with the phone's pin, passphrase, or biometric authentication.[73] The user can define a "screen lock timeout" interval, providing an additional protection mechanism in case the phone is lost or stolen.[70][73] Signal also allows users to set timers to messages.[74] After a specified time interval, the messages will be deleted from both the sender's and the receivers' devices.[74] The time interval can be between five seconds and one week long,[74] and the timer begins for each recipient once they have read their copy of the message.[75] The developers have stressed that this is meant to be "a collaborative feature for conversations where all participants want to automate minimalist data hygiene, not for situations where your contact is your adversary".[74][75] Signal excludes users' messages from non-encrypted cloud backups by default.[76] Signal has support for read receipts and typing indicators, both of which can be disabled.[77][78] Signal allows users to automatically blur faces of people in photos to protect their identities.[79][80][81][82] Limitations[edit] Signal requires that the user provides a phone number for verification,[83] eliminating the need for user names or passwords and facilitating contact discovery (see below).[84] The number does not have to be the same as on the device's SIM card; it can also be a VoIP number[83] or a landline as long as the user can receive the verification code and have a separate device to set up the software. A number can only be registered on one mobile device at a time.[85] This mandatory connection to a phone number (a feature Signal shares with WhatsApp, KakaoTalk, and others) has been criticized as a "major issue" for privacy-conscious users who are not comfortable with giving out their private phone number.[84] A workaround is to use a secondary phone number.[84] The option to choose a public, changeable username instead of sharing one's phone number with everyone they message (or share a group with) is a widely requested feature, which as of June 2020 has not yet been implemented.[84][86][87] Signal in 2019 announced plans to implement this feature, overcoming the challenges associated with storing users' social graphs by using what they called Secure Value Recovery (SVR).[88] This allows users to client-side encrypt their Signal contacts with an alphanumeric passphrase (which Signal calls a PIN[89]) and uses Intel SGX to limit the number of passphrase guesses, alleviating the risk of server-side brute-force attempts.[88][90][91] Cryptography expert Matthew D. Green described this method as "sophisticated work,"[92] but also expressed concerns that the data the system was protecting should not rely on the security of SGX, which has been repeatedly broken.[93][94] Using phone numbers as identifiers may also create security risks that arise from the possibility of an attacker taking over a phone number.[84] This can be mitigated by enabling an optional Registration Lock PIN in Signal's privacy settings.[95] Android-specific[edit] From February 2014[29] to February 2017,[96] Signal's official Android client required the proprietary Google Play Services because the app was dependent on Google's GCM push-messaging framework.[97][96] In March 2015, Signal moved to a model of handling the app's message delivery themselves and only using GCM for a wakeup event.[98] In February 2017, Signal's developers implemented WebSocket support into the client, making it possible for it to be used without Google Play Services.[96] Desktop-specific[edit] Setting up Signal's desktop app requires that the user first install Signal on an Android or iOS based smartphone with an Internet connection.[11] Once the desktop app has been linked to the user's account, it will function as an independent client; the mobile app does not need to be present or online.[99] Users can link up to 5 desktop apps to their account.[85] Usability[edit] In July 2016, the Internet Society published a user study that assessed the ability of Signal users to detect and deter man-in-the-middle attacks.[20] The study concluded that 21 out of 28 participants failed to correctly compare public key fingerprints in order to verify the identity of other Signal users, and that the majority of these users still believed they had succeeded, while in reality they failed.[20] Four months later, Signal's user interface was updated to make verifying the identity of other Signal users simpler.[100] Before version 4.17,[101] the Signal Android client could only make plain text-only backups of the message history, i.e. without media messages.[102][103] On February 26, 2018, Signal added support for "full backup/restore to SD card",[104] and as of version 4.17, users are able to restore their entire message history when switching to a new Android phone.[101] On June 09, 2020, the Signal iOS client added the ability to transfer all Signal information from an old iOS device to a new one. The transfer is done wirelessly over a local connection between the two devices and is end-to-end encrypted.[105] Architecture[edit] Encryption protocols[edit] Main article: Signal Protocol Signal messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol (formerly known as the TextSecure Protocol). The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and a Triple Diffie-Hellman (3XDH) handshake.[106] It uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 as primitives.[19] The protocol provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy (aka future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity.[107] It does not provide anonymity preservation, and requires servers for the relaying of messages and storing of public key material.[107] The Signal Protocol also supports end-to-end encrypted group chats. The group chat protocol is a combination of a pairwise double ratchet and multicast encryption.[107] In addition to the properties provided by the one-to-one protocol, the group chat protocol provides speaker consistency, out-of-order resilience, dropped message resilience, computational equality, trust equality, subgroup messaging, as well as contractible and expandable membership.[107] In October 2014, researchers from Ruhr University Bochum published an analysis of the Signal Protocol.[19] Among other findings, they presented an unknown key-share attack on the protocol, but in general, they found that it was secure.[108] In October 2016, researchers from UK's University of Oxford, Queensland University of Technology in Australia, and Canada's McMaster University published a formal analysis of the protocol.[109][110] They concluded that the protocol was cryptographically sound.[109][110] In July 2017, researchers from Ruhr University Bochum found during another analysis of group messengers a purely theoretic attack against the group protocol of Signal: A user who knows the secret group ID of a group (due to having been a group member previously or stealing it from a member's device) can become a member of the group. Since the group ID cannot be guessed and such member changes are displayed to the remaining members, this attack is likely to be difficult to carry out without being detected.[111] As of August 2018[update], the Signal Protocol has been implemented into WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype,[112] and Google Allo,[113] making it possible for the conversations of "more than a billion people worldwide" to be end-to-end encrypted.[114] In Google Allo, Skype and Facebook Messenger, conversations are not encrypted with the Signal Protocol by default; they only offer end-to-end encryption in an optional mode.[76][115][112][116] Up until March 2017, Signal's voice calls were encrypted with SRTP and the ZRTP key-agreement protocol, which was developed by Phil Zimmermann.[1][117] As of March 2017[update], Signal's voice and video calling functionalities use the app's Signal Protocol channel for authentication instead of ZRTP.[118][36][17] Authentication[edit] To verify that a correspondent is really the person that they claim to be, Signal users can compare key fingerprints (or scan QR codes) out-of-band.[70] The app employs a trust on first use mechanism in order to notify the user if a correspondent's key changes.[70] Servers[edit] Signal relies on centralized servers that are maintained by Signal Messenger. In addition to routing Signal's messages, the servers also facilitate the discovery of contacts who are also registered Signal users and the automatic exchange of users' public keys. By default, Signal's voice and video calls are peer-to-peer.[17] If the caller is not in the receiver's address book, the call is routed through a server in order to hide the users' IP addresses.[17] Contact discovery[edit] The servers store registered users' phone numbers, public key material and push tokens which are necessary for setting up calls and transmitting messages.[119] In order to determine which contacts are also Signal users, cryptographic hashes of the user's contact numbers are periodically transmitted to the server.[120] The server then checks to see if those match any of the SHA256 hashes of registered users and tells the client if any matches are found.[120] The hashed numbers are thereafter discarded from the server.[119] In 2014, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that it is easy to calculate a map of all possible hash inputs to hash outputs and reverse the mapping because of the limited preimage space (the set of all possible hash inputs) of phone numbers, and that a "practical privacy preserving contact discovery remains an unsolved problem."[121][120] In September 2017, Signal's developers announced that they were working on a way for the Signal client applications to "efficiently and scalably determine whether the contacts in their address book are Signal users without revealing the contacts in their address book to the Signal service."[122][123] Metadata[edit] All client-server communications are protected by TLS.[117][124] In October 2018, Signal deployed a "Sealed Sender" feature which encrypts the sender's information using the sender and recipient identity keys, and includes it inside the message. With this feature Signal's servers can no longer see who is sending messages to whom.[125] Signal's privacy policy states that any identifiers are only kept on the servers as long as necessary in order to place each call or transmit each message.[119] Signal's developers have asserted that their servers do not keep logs about who called whom and when.[126] In June 2016, Marlinspike told The Intercept that "the closest piece of information to metadata that the Signal server stores is the last time each user connected to the server, and the precision of this information is reduced to the day, rather than the hour, minute, and second".[76] The group messaging mechanism is designed so that the servers do not have access to the membership list, group title, or group icon.[54] Instead, the creation, updating, joining, and leaving of groups is done by the clients, which deliver pairwise messages to the participants in the same way that one-to-one messages are delivered.[127][128] Federation[edit] Signal's server architecture was federated between December 2013 and February 2016. In December 2013, it was announced that the messaging protocol Signal uses had successfully been integrated into the Android-based open-source operating system CyanogenMod.[129][130][131] Since CyanogenMod 11.0, the client logic was contained in a system app called WhisperPush. According to Signal's developers, the Cyanogen team ran their own Signal messaging server for WhisperPush clients, which federated with the main server, so that both clients could exchange messages with each other.[131] The WhisperPush source code was available under the GPLv3 license.[132] In February 2016, the CyanogenMod team discontinued WhisperPush and recommended that its users switch to Signal.[133] In May 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that federation with the CyanogenMod servers had degraded the user experience and held back development, and that their servers will probably not federate with other servers again.[134] In May 2016, Moxie Marlinspike requested that a third-party client called LibreSignal not use the Signal service or the Signal name.[134] As a result, on 24 May 2016 the LibreSignal project posted that the project was "abandoned".[135] The functionality provided by LibreSignal was subsequently incorporated into Signal by Marlinspike.[136] Licensing[edit] The complete source code of the Signal clients for Android, iOS and desktop is available on GitHub under a free software license.[12][13][14] This enables interested parties to examine the code and help the developers verify that everything is behaving as expected. It also allows advanced users to compile their own copies of the applications and compare them with the versions that are distributed by Signal Messenger. In March 2016, Moxie Marlinspike wrote that, apart from some shared libraries that are not compiled with the project build due to a lack of Gradle NDK support, Signal for Android is reproducible.[137] Signal's servers are also open source.[15] Distribution[edit] Signal is officially distributed through the Google Play store, Apple's App Store, and the official website. Applications distributed via Google Play are signed by the developer of the application, and the Android operating system checks that updates are signed with the same key, preventing others from distributing updates that the developer themselves did not sign.[138][139] The same applies to iOS applications that are distributed via Apple's App Store.[140] As of March 2017, the Android version of Signal can also be downloaded as a separate APK package binary from Signal Messenger's website.[141] Reception[edit] In October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide.[142] In November 2014, Signal received a perfect score on the EFF's secure messaging scorecard;[69] it received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the provider doesn't have access to (end-to-end encryption), making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondents' identities, having past communications secure if the keys are stolen (forward secrecy), having the code open to independent review (open source), having the security designs well-documented, and having a recent independent security audit.[69] At the time, "ChatSecure + Orbot", Pidgin (with OTR), Silent Phone, and Telegram's optional "secret chats" also received seven out of seven points on the scorecard.[69] On December 28, 2014, Der Spiegel published slides from an internal NSA presentation dating to June 2012 in which the NSA deemed Signal's encrypted voice calling component (RedPhone) on its own as a "major threat" to its mission, and when used in conjunction with other privacy tools such as Cspace, Tor, Tails, and TrueCrypt was ranked as "catastrophic", leading to a "near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence..."[143][144] Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden has endorsed Signal on multiple occasions.[34] In his keynote speech at SXSW in March 2014, he praised Signal's predecessors (TextSecure and RedPhone) for their ease of use.[145] During an interview with The New Yorker in October 2014, he recommended using "anything from Moxie Marlinspike and Open Whisper Systems".[146] During a remote appearance at an event hosted by Ryerson University and Canadian Journalists for Free Expression in March 2015, Snowden said that Signal is "very good" and that he knew the security model.[147] Asked about encrypted messaging apps during a Reddit AMA in May 2015, he recommended Signal.[148][149] In November 2015, Snowden tweeted that he used Signal "every day".[33][150] In September 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union called on officials at the U.S. Capitol to ensure that lawmakers and staff members have secure communications technology.[151] One of the applications that the ACLU recommended in their letter to the Senate Sergeant at Arms and to the House Sergeant at Arms was Signal, writing: One of the most widely respected encrypted communication apps, Signal, from Open Whisper Systems, has received significant financial support from the U.S. government, has been audited by independent security experts, and is now widely used by computer security professionals, many of the top national security journalists, and public interest advocates. Indeed, members of the ACLU’s own legal department regularly use Signal to make encrypted telephone calls.[152] In March 2017, Signal was approved by the Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate for use by senators and their staff.[153][154] Following the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak, Vanity Fair reported that Marc Elias, the general counsel for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, had instructed DNC staffers to exclusively use Signal when saying anything "remotely contentious or disparaging" about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.[155][156] In February 2020, the European Commission has recommended that its staff use Signal.[157] Concurrently with the George Floyd protests, Signal was downloaded 121,000 times in the United States between 25 May and 4 June in 2020.[158] Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey advised the public to download Signal as protests spread in the US.[159] In July 2020, Signal became the most downloaded app in Hong Kong on both Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store after the passage of the Hong Kong National Security Law.[160] As of 2020, Signal is one of the contact methods to securely provide tips to major news outlets such as Washington Post,[161] The Guardian,[162] New York Times[163] and Wall Street Journal.[164] Blocking[edit] Countries where Signal's domain fronting is enabled by default Countries where Signal is blocked (January 2018) In December 2016, Egypt blocked access to Signal.[165] In response, Signal's developers added domain fronting to their service.[166] This allows Signal users in a specific country to circumvent censorship by making it look like they are connecting to a different internet-based service.[166][167] As of October 2017[update], Signal's domain fronting is enabled by default in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar.[168] As of January 2018[update], Signal is blocked in Iran.[169][170] Signal's domain fronting feature relies on the Google App Engine service.[170][169] This does not work in Iran because Google has blocked Iranian access to GAE in order to comply with U.S. sanctions.[169][171] In early 2018, Google App Engine made an internal change to stop domain fronting for all countries. Due to this issue, Signal made a public change to use Amazon CloudFront for domain fronting. However, AWS also announced that they would be making changes to their service to prevent domain fronting. As a result, Signal said that they would start investigating new methods/approaches.[172][173] Signal switched from AWS back to Google in April 2019.[174] Developers and funding[edit] Main articles: Signal Messenger and Signal Foundation The development of Signal and its predecessors at Open Whisper Systems was funded by a combination of consulting contracts, donations and grants.[175] The Freedom of the Press Foundation acted as Signal's fiscal sponsor.[37][176][177] Between 2013 and 2016, the project received grants from the Knight Foundation,[178] the Shuttleworth Foundation,[179] and almost $3M from the US-Government sponsored Open Technology Fund.[180] Signal is now developed by Signal Messenger LLC, a software company founded by Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton in 2018, which is wholly owned by a tax-exempt nonprofit corporation called the Signal Technology Foundation, also created by them in 2018. The Foundation was funded with an initial loan of $50 million from Acton, "to support, accelerate, and broaden Signal’s mission of making private communication accessible and ubiquitous."[37][21][181] All of the organization's products are published as free and open-source software.

He was assassinated in Luhansk, with conflicting reports on who was responsible.[2] Contents 1 Death 2 See also 3 Notes 4 References 5 External links Death[edit] Bednov commanded the Rapid Response Group "Batman" (also known as the Batman Battalion) until he was killed in an attack on his convoy on 1 January 2015.[3] Members of the group said that the attack was ordered by head of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Igor Plotnitsky.[3] According to them, Bednov and his fighters were killed "by order of Plotnitsky" because he was "ordered to sweep all intransigent commanders."[4][5] Following this attack, the LPR arrested some of Bednov's men, and dissolved the battalion.[6] Some of its personnel were dispersed into other LPR units, while Donetsk People's Republic field commanders Givi and Motorola invited former members to join their battalions.[6] After Bednov's assassination, Igor Girkin criticized the killing as a "murder" and "gangster ambush", and suggested that other commanders seriously consider leaving Donbass to Russia, as he did.[7] See also[edit] Separatist forces of the war in Donbass Evgeny Ischenko [ru] Roman Voznik Aleksey Mozgovoy Pavel Dryomov [ru] Evgeny Zhilin [ru; uk] Gennadiy Tsypkalov Arsen Pavlov Valery Bolotov List of unsolved murders Mikhail Tolstykh Alexander Zakharchenko Notes[edit] ^ At the time of his death, Lutuhyne was part of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic.

He was a son of king Khafre and queen Hekenuhedjet.[1][2] He served as vizier during the beginning of the next dynasty, during the reigns of Userkaf and Sahure.[3][2] Sekhemkare is the only son of Khafre, whose death can be fairly securely dated to a precise reign, here that of Sahure.[4] Family[edit] Sekhemkare was the son of Khafre and Hekenuhedjet, who are both mentioned in his tomb. A number of offspring are also mentioned:[5] Sekhemkare II, the eldest son and royal acquaintance. Horkhaf, son and royal acquaintance. Khafre-ankh, son and royal acquaintance. Khafre-bab, son and royal acquaintance. Tomb[edit] The tomb of Sekhemkare is known as G 8154 (= LG 89), located in the Central Field which is part of the Giza Necropolis. His tomb is located to the southwest of that of his brother Nikaure and to the northwest of the tombs of Niuserre and Niankhre. The rock-cut tomb is situated to the northwest of the complex of Queen Khentkaus I and southeast of the Pyramid of Khafre. On the doorjambs at the tomb entrance Sekhemkare is identified as "the king's son of his body, hereditary prince, count, councilor, sealer of the king of Lower Egypt, chief lector-priest of his father, sole companion, secretary of the House of Morning, assistant of (the god) Duau, secretary of his father". In other scenes he has the additional titles of chief justice and vizier and director of the palace.

Alevis are found primarily in Turkey among ethnic Turks and Kurds,[7] and make up approximately 11% of the population;[8] but recent figures suggest Alevis number in the region of 20 to 25 million.[9] They are the second-largest Islamic sect in Turkey, with Sunni Hanafi Islam being the largest.[5] After the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a dispute arose about his legitimate successor. The Islamic community was divided into those who adhered to Abu Bakr, named Sunnis, and those who sided with Ali, called Shia. Concurrently, people who sided with Ali were called Alevis, defined as "those who adore Ali and his family".[10] Therefore, some authors use Shiism synonymously with Alevism.[11] However, Alevism is not Twelver Shiism, but rather its own Sufi centric form of Shiism.[11] and although they share some common beliefs with the Twelver Shia, their rites and practices are different from Twelver Shiism.[10] Thus Alevism incorporates Turkish beliefs present during the 14th century,[10] mixed with Shia, Sunni and Sufi beliefs that were adopted by some Turkish and later Kurdish tribes.[11] Alevis have strong links with Twelver Shia Islam (such as importance of the Ahl al-Bayt, the Aşura, the Mourning of Muharram, commemorating Karbala), but do not follow taqlid towards a Marja' "source of emulation". Some practices of the Alevis are based on the Sufi doctrines of the Bektashi[4] Tariqa.[12] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Beliefs 2.1 God 2.2 Spirits and afterlife 2.3 Scriptures and prophets 2.4 The Twelve Imams 2.5 Plurality 2.6 The Perfect human being 2.7 Interpretation of tafsir 2.8 Creed and jurisprudence 3 Differences with other Muslim denominations 3.1 Alawites 4 Practices 4.1 Dede 4.2 Cem and Cemevi 4.3 Twelve services 4.4 Festivals 4.4.1 Mourning of Muharram 4.4.2 Hıdırellez 4.4.3 Müsahiplik 4.4.4 Folk practices 4.4.4.1 Ziyarat to sacred places 4.4.4.2 Almsgiving 5 Society 5.1 Leadership structure 5.2 Position of women 5.3 Relations with other Muslim groups 5.3.1 Sufi elements in Alevism 5.3.2 Relations with majority Sunnis 6 History 6.1 Seljuk period 6.2 Ottoman period 6.3 Republic 7 Demographics 7.1 Population estimates 7.2 Social groups 8 Influences of the Muslim sects on the Alevī faith throughout Anatolia and the Balkans 8.1 Bektashi 8.1.1 Bektashiyyah doctrine: Bektashism and Hurufism 8.1.1.1 Wahdat al-Mawjud 8.1.1.2 Batiniyya and Ismailism 8.1.2 Qizilbash 8.1.2.1 Qizilbash doctrine: Kızılbaşlık 9 Alevi music 10 See also 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links Etymology[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(October 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) "Alevi" (/æˈlɛvi/) is generally explained as referring to Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. The name represents a Turkish form of the word ‘Alawi (Arabic: علوي‎) "of or pertaining to Ali". A minority viewpoint is that of the Ishikists, who assert, "Alevi" was derived from "Alev" ("flame" in Turkish) in reference to fire which is extensively used in Alevi rituals. According to them the use of candles is based on Quran chapter 24, verses 35 and 36: "God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which there is a lamp, the lamp is encased in a glass, the glass is like a radiant planet, which is lit from a blessed olive tree that is neither of the east nor of the west, its oil nearly gives off light even if not touched by fire. Light upon light, God guides to His light whom He pleases. And God sets forth examples for the people, and God is aware of all things. (Lit is such a Light) in houses, which God has permitted to be raised to honor; for the celebration, in them, of His name: In them is He glorified in the mornings and in the evenings, (again and again).") Beliefs[edit] Main articles: Faith and Iman (concept) According to scholar Soner Çağaptay, Alevism is a "relatively unstructured interpretation of Islam".[13] Journalist Patrick Kingsley states that for some self-described Alevi, their religion is "simply a cultural identity, rather than a form of worship".[5] Many teachings are based on an orally transmitted tradition, traditionally kept secret from outsiders (but now widely accessible). Alevis commonly profess the Islamic shahada, but adding "Ali is the friend of God". The basis for Alevis' most distinctive beliefs is found in the Buyruks (compiled writings and dialogues of Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili, and other worthies). Also included are hymns (nefes) by figures such as Shah Ismail or Pir Sultan Abdal, stories of Hajji Bektash and other lore. God[edit] Main articles: Allah, Muhammad-Ali, and Haqq-Muhammad-Ali In Alevi cosmology, God is also called Al-Haqq (the Truth)[14] or referred to as Allah. God created life, so the created world can reflect His Being.[15] Alevis believe in the unity of Allah, Muhammad, and Ali, but this is not a trinity composed of God and the historical figures of Muhammad and Ali. Rather, Muhammad and Ali are representations of Allah's light (and not of Allah himself), being neither independent from God, nor separate characteristics of Him.[14] Haqq-Muhammad-Ali Muhammad-Ali ALLAH ALI MUHAMMAD Left side: Ali ibn Abi Talib, Center: Muhammad, Right side: Allah. (Reflections of the Qizilbash-Bektashi belief) In Alevi writings are many references to the unity of Muhammad and Ali, such as: A representation of the sword of Ali, the Zulfiqar in an Ottoman emblem. Ali Muhammed'dir uh dur fah'ad, Muhammad Ali, (Ali is Muhammad, Muhammad is Ali) Gördüm bir elmadır, el-Hamdû'liLlâh. (I've seen an apple, all praise is for God)[16] The phrase "For the love of Allah-Muhammad-Ali" (Hakk-Muhammed-Ali aşkına) is common to several Alevi prayers. Spirits and afterlife[edit] Alevis believe in the immortality of the soul.[14] Alevis, who believe in a literal existence of supernatural beings, also believe in good and bad angels (melekler), basically the same as Sunni Islam. Alevis, believe in Satan who is the one that encourages human's evil desires (nefs). Alevis, believe in an existence of spiritual creatures, such as the Jinns (Cinler) and the evil eye.[17] Scriptures and prophets[edit] Like Islam, all Alevis acknowledge at least the four scriptures revealed from heaven.[18] Additionally, Alevis don't mind to look to other religious books outside the four major ones as sources for their beliefs including Hadiths, Nahjul Balagha and Buyruks. Alevism also acknowledges the Islamic prophet Mohammed (peygamber).[19] "Alevi-Bektashis acknowledge they are from Ahl al Kitab" by stating that the last four holy books (Quran, Gospel, Torah and Psalms) has the same degree of importance in guiding people to the Divine Truth. This confession is pronounced in Turkish: "Dört kitab'ın Dördü de Hâkk". (Four valid books in Islam, namely Psalms, Torah, Gospel, and Qur'an are all the "Righteous") Quran Gospel Torah Psalms Quran Surah 2 verse 136 says: "We believe in Allah, and in that which has been sent down on us and sent down on Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the Tribes, and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the Prophets, of their Lord; we make no division between any of them, and to Him we surrender". The Twelve Imams[edit] Main article: The Twelve Imams The Twelve Imams are part of another common Alevi belief. Each Imam represents a different aspect of the world. They are realized as twelve services or On İki Hizmet which are performed by members of the Alevi community. Each Imam is believed to be a reflection of Ali ibn Abu Talib, the first Imam of the Shi'ites, and there are references to the "First Ali" (Birinci Ali), Imam Hasan the "Second 'Ali" (İkinci Ali), and so on up to the "Twelfth 'Ali" (Onikinci Ali), Imam Mehdi. The Twelfth Imam is hidden and represents the Messianic Age. Plurality[edit] There are two sides to creation, one from a spiritual center to plurality, another from plurality to the spiritual center. Plurality is the separation of pure consciousness from the divine source. It is seen as a curtain alienating creation from the divine source and an illusion which called the Zāherī or exoteric side to reality. The hidden or true nature of creation is called the bāṭenī[6] or the esoteric. The plurality in nature is attributed to the infinite potential energy of Kull-i Nafs when it takes corporeal form as it descends into being from Allah. During the Cem ceremony, the cantor or aşık sings: "All of us alive or lifeless are from one, this is ineffable, Sultan. For to love and to fall in love has been my fate from time immemorial." This is sung as a reminder that the reason for creation is love, so that the followers may know themselves and each other and that they may love that which they know. The Ja'far al-Sadiq's historical tomb of Al-Baqi' before being destroyed in 1926. The Perfect human being[edit] Main article: Al-Insān al-Kāmil Linked to the concept of the Prototypical Human is that of the "Perfect Human Being" (Insan-i Kamil). Although it is common to refer to Ali and Haji Bektash Veli or the other Alevi saints as manifestations of the perfect human being, the Perfect Human Being is also identified with our true identity as pure consciousness, hence the Qur'anic concept of human beings not having original sin, consciousness being pure and perfect.[citation needed] The human task is to fully realize this state while still in material human form. The perfect human being is also defined in practical terms, as one who is in full moral control of his or her hands, tongue and loins (eline diline beline sahip); treats all kinds of people equally (yetmiş iki millete aynı gözle bakar); and serves the interests of others. One who has achieved this kind of enlightenment is also called "eren" or "münevver" (mūnavvar).[citation needed] Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili Khānegāh and Shrine Ensemble. Interpretation of tafsir[edit] According to The President of the Islamic-Alevi Religious Services Dede İzzettin Doğan, "Alevism" is simply a tasawwufī-bāṭenī[6] interpretation (tafsir) of Islam.[20] What's Alevism, what's the understanding of Islam in Alevism? The answers to these questions, instead of the opposite of what's known by many people is that the birthplace of Alevism was never in Anatolia. This is an example of great ignorance, that is, to tell that the Alevism was emerged in Anatolia. Searching the source of Alevism in Anatolia arises from unawareness. Because there was not even one single Muslim or Turk in Anatolia before a specific date. The roots of Alevism stem from Turkestan – Central Asia. Islam was brought to Anatolia by Turks in 10th and 11th centuries by a result of migration for a period of 100–150 years. Before this event took place, there were no Muslim and Turks in Anatolia. Anatolia was then entirely Christian.[21] We Turks brought Islam to Anatolia from Turkestan. —Professor İzzettin Doğan, The President of Alevi-Islam Religion Services Asādʿullāh: Nickname given by Muhammad to describe his kinsman Ali. Asadullah means "Lion of Allah", which is also well known as "Ismāʿīlī". Alevism, Bektashism and Sufism consider Ali as the holder of the divine secrets and esoteric meaning of Islam, transmitted to him by Muhammad. "I am the city of knowledge, Ali is its gate." —Muhammad. Alevi used to be grouped as Kızılbaş ("redheads"), a generic term used by Sunni Muslims in the Ottoman Empire for the various Shia sects from the 15th century. Many other names exist (often for subgroupings), among them Tahtacı "Woodcutters", Abdal "Bards" and Çepni.[citation needed] Creed and jurisprudence[edit] See also: Kaysanites Shia, Muhammerah, Khurramites, Qarmatians, Batiniyya, and Hurufism Sources differ on how important formal doctrine is among contemporary Alevi. According to scholar Russell Powell there is a tradition of informal "Dede" courts within the Alevi society, but regarding Islamic jurisprudence or fiqh there has been "little scholarship on Alevi influences" in it.[22] Other sources put more emphasis on creed and doctrine. Alevīs follow Tasawwufī-Batiniyya aqidah (creed) of Maymūn’al-Qāddāhī according to one source (Dede İzzettin Doğan).[23][24] In contrast the Sunni majority of Turkey's population follows Maturidi aqidah of the Hanafi fiqh and Ash'ari aqidah of the Shafi'i fiqh. According to another source, Alevi aqidah (creed or theological convictions) is based upon a syncretic fiqh system called as Batiniyya-Sufism/Ismailism[25] which incorporates some sentiments of Sevener-Qarmatians, originally introduced by Abu’l-Khāttāb Muhammad ibn Abu Zaynab al-Asadī,[26][27] and later developed by "Maymun al-Qāddāh" and his son "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maymun",[28] and Mu'tazila with a strong belief in the Twelve Imams. "The Alevi-Turks" has a unique belief system tracing back to Kaysanites and Khurramites which are considered Ghulat Shia Islam by some. According to Turkish scholar Abdülbaki Gölpinarli, the Qizilbash (Red-Heads) of the 16th century – a religious and political movement in Azerbaijan that helped to establish the Safavid dynasty – were spiritual descendants of the Khurramites.[29] Among the members of the "Qizilbash-Tariqa" who are considered as a sub-sect of the Alevis, two figures firstly Abu Muslim Khorasani[citation needed], who assisted Abbasid Caliphate to beat the Umayyad Caliphate but later eliminated and murdered by Caliph Al-Mansur and secondly Babak Khorramdin who incited a rebellion against Abbasid Caliphate and consequently was killed by Caliph al-Mu'tasim, are highly respected. This belief provides strong clues about their Kaysanites Shia and Khurramites origins. In addition, Safaviyya Tariqa leader Shāh Ismāʿīl is a highly regarded individual in the belief of Alevi-Qizilbash-Tariqa associating them with the Imamah (Shia Twelver doctrine) conviction of Twelver Shia Islam. On the other hand, Bektashis has a conviction of Batiniyya Ismailism[25] and Hurufism with a strong belief in the Twelve Imams. Qizilbash-Alevi-Bektashis differ from followers of Ja'fari jurisprudence, in their Batiniyya-Hurufism and Qarmatian-Isma'ilism sentiments.[30] Differences with other Muslim denominations[edit] Part of a series on IslamAqidah Five Pillars of Islam Shahada Salah Sawm Zakat Hajj SunniSix articles of belief God Prophets Holy books Angels The Last Judgement Predestination Sunni theological traditions Ilm al-Kalam Ash'ari1 Maturidi2 Traditionalist Hanbalis3 Hanafi Maliki Shafi‘i Shi'aSeven pillars of Isma'ilism4 Walayah Tawhid Salah Zakat Sawm Hajj Jihad Theology of Twelvers5 Principles Tawhid Adalah Prophecy Imamah Qiyamah Practices Salah Sawm Zakat Hajj Khums Jihad Commanding what is just Forbidding what is evil Tawalla Tabarra Other Shia concepts of Aqidah Imamate Batin Other schools of theology Murji'ah Karramiyya Mu'attila Jabriyyah6 Muhakkima Khawarij7 Ibadi8 Taṣawwuf9 Qadariyah Alevism Muʿtazila10 Quranism Including:1Al-Ahbash; Barelvis 2Deobandi3Salafis (Ahl-i Hadith & Wahhabis) 4Sevener-Qarmatians, Assassins & Druzes 5Alawites, Qizilbash & Bektashism; 6Jahmīyya 7Ajardi, Azariqa, Bayhasiyya, Najdat & Sūfrī 8Nukkari; 9Bektashis & Qalandaris; Mevlevis, Süleymancıs & various Ṭarīqah10Bahshamiyya, Bishriyya & Ikhshîdiyya Islam portalvte Qizilbash and the Bektashi Order shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as Alevis in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Alevis developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, Alevis developed a tradition of opposition to all forms of external religion.[31] Alevis accept Twelver Shi‘a beliefs about Ali and the Twelve Imams. Moreover, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed Alevis to be part of the Shia fold in the 1970s.[32] There are, however, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals that are appreciably different than those of Twelver Shias in Iraq, Iran, and Lebanon. In particular, much of mystical language in the Alevi tradition is inspired by Sufi traditions. Some sources link Alevism in particular to the heterodox syncretic[4] Sufi group known as the Bektashi Order, which is also Shi'ite. Furthermore, during the period of Ottoman Empire, Alevis were forbidden to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict endogamy which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group.[33] Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication was the ultimate punishment threatening those who married outsiders, cooperated with outsiders economically, or ate with outsiders. It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts.[31] Further information on Alevi Muslim sect: Schools of Islamic theology § Alevism, and Antinomianism Alawites[edit] Similarities with the Alawite sect in Syria exist. Both are viewed as heterodox, syncretic Islamic minorities, whose names both mean "devoted to Ali," (the son-in-law and cousin of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and fourth caliph following Muhammad as leader of the Muslims), and are located primarily in the Eastern Mediterranean. Like mainstream Shia they are known as "Twelvers" as they both recognize the Twelve Imams. How the two minorities relate is disputed. According to scholar Marianne Aringberg-Laanatza, "the Turkish Alevis... do not relate themselves in any way to the Alawites in Syria."[citation needed] However journalist Jeffrey Gettlemand claims that both Alevi and the less than one million Alawite minority in Turkey "seem to be solidly behind Syria’s embattled strongman, Bashar al-Assad" and leary of Syrian Sunni rebels.[34] DW journalist Dorian Jones states that Turkish Alevis are suspicious of the anti-Assad uprising in Syria. "They are worried of the repercussions for Alawites there, as well as for themselves."[35] Some sources (Martin van Bruinessen and Jamal Shah) mistake Alawites living in Turkey to be Alevis (calling Alevis "a blanket term for a large number of different heterodox communities"),[36] but others do not, giving a list of the differences between the two groups. These include their liturgical languages (Turkish or Kurdish for Alevi, Arabic for Alawites). Opposing political nationalism, with Alawites supporting their ruling dictatorship and considering Turks (including Alevis) an "opponent" of its Arab "historic interests".[citation needed] (Even Kurdish and Balkan Alevi populations pray in Turkish.)[13] Unlike Alevis, Alawites not only traditionally lack mosques but do not maintain their own places for worship, except for shrines to their leaders.[citation needed] Alevi "possess an extensive and widely-read religious literature, mainly composed of spiritual songs, poems, and epic verse." Their origins are also different: The Alawite faith was founded in the ninth century by Abu Shuayb Muhammad ibn Nusayr. Alevism started in the 14th century by mystical Islamic dissenters in Central Asia, and represent more of a movement rather than a sect. Practices[edit] Main article: Four Doors The Alevi spiritual path (yol) is commonly understood to take place through four major life-stages, or "gates". These may be further subdivided into "four gates, forty levels" (Dört Kapı Kırk Makam). The first gate (religious law) is considered elementary (and this may be perceived as subtle criticism of other Muslim traditions). The following are major crimes that cause an Alevi to be declared düşkün (shunned):[37] killing a person committing adultery divorcing one's wife stealing backbiting/gossiping Most Alevi activity takes place in the context of the second gate (spiritual brotherhood), during which one submits to a living spiritual guide (dede, pir, mürşid). The existence of the third and fourth gates is mostly theoretical, though some older Alevis have apparently received initiation into the third.[38] Further information: Pir (Sufism), Dedes, and Murshid Dede[edit] A Dede (literally meaning grandfather) is a traditional leader that is claimed to be from the lineage of Prophet Muhammad that performs ritual baptisms for newborns, officiates at funerals, and organises weekly gatherings at cemevis.[39] Cem and Cemevi[edit] Main articles: Jem (Alevism) and Cemevi Bağlama. Alevi cultural and other social activities take place in assembly houses (Cemevi). The ceremony's prototype is the Muhammad's nocturnal ascent into heaven, where he beheld a gathering of forty saints (Kırklar Meclisi), and the Divine Reality made manifest in their leader, Ali. The Cem ceremony features music, singing, and dancing (Samāh) in which both women and men participate. Rituals are performed in Turkish, Zazaki, Kurmanji and other local languages. Bağlama Main article: Bağlama During the Cem ceremony the Âşık plays the Bağlama whilst singing spiritual songs, some of which are centuries old and well known amongst Alevis. Every song, called a Nefes, has spiritual meaning and aims to teach the participants important lessons. One such song goes thus: "Learn from your mistakes and be knowledgeable, Don't look for faults in others, Look at 73 different people in the same way, God loves and created them all, so don't say anything against them." Samāh A family of ritual dances characterized by turning and swirling, is an inseparable part of any cem. Samāh is performed by men and women together, to the accompaniment of the Bağlama. The dances symbolize (for example) the revolution of the planets around the Sun (by man and woman turning in circles), and the putting off of one's self and uniting with God. Görgü Cemi The Rite of Integration (görgü cemi) is a complex ritual occasion in which a variety of tasks are allotted to incumbents bound together by extrafamilial brotherhood (müsahiplik), who undertake a dramatization of unity and integration under the direction of the spiritual leader (dede). Dem The love of the creator for the created and vice versa is symbolised in the Cem ceremony by the use of fruit juice and/or red wine[citation needed] [Dem] which represents the intoxication of the lover in the beloved. During the ceremony Dem is one of the twelve duties of the participants. (see above) Sohbet At the closing of the cem ceremony the Dede who leads the ceremony engages the participants in a discussion (chat), this discussion is called a sohbet. Twelve services[edit] There are twelve services (Turkish: On İki hizmet) performed by the twelve ministers of the cem. Dede: This is the leader of the Cem who represents Muhammad and Ali. The Dede receives confession from the attendees at the beginning of the ceremony. He also leads funerals, Müsahiplik, marriage ceremonies and circumcisions. The status of Dede is hereditary and he must be a descendant of Ali and Fatima. Rehber: This position represents Husayn. The Rehber is a guide to the faithful and works closely with the Dede in the community. Gözcü: This position represents Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. S/he is the assistant to the Rehber. S/he is the Cem keeper responsible for keeping the faithful calm. Çerağcı: This position represents Jabir ibn Abd-Allah and s/he is the light-keeper responsible for maintaining the light traditionally given by a lamp or candles. Zakir: This position represents Bilal ibn al-Harith. S/he plays the bağlama and recites songs and prayers. Süpürgeci: This position represents Salman the Persian. S/he is responsible for cleaning the Cemevi hall and symbolically sweeping the carpets during the Cem. Meydancı: This position represents Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman. Niyazcı: this position represents Muhammad ibn Maslamah. S/he is responsible for distributing the sacred meal. İbrikçi: this position represents Kamber. S/he is responsible for washing the hands of the attendees. Kapıcı: this position represents Ghulam Kaysan. S/he is responsible for calling the faithful to the Cem. Peyikçi: this position represents Amri Ayyari. Sakacı: represents Ammar ibn Yasir. Responsible for the distribution of water, sherbet (sharbat), milk etc.. Festivals[edit] 10th of Muharrem – The Day of Ashura: Huseyn bin Ali was murdered at Kerbela. Mourning of Muharram and the remembrance of this event by Jafaris, Alevis and Bektashis together in Ottoman Empire. Painted by Fausto Zonaro. Main articles: Day of Ashura and Nowruz Newruz "New Day" is the Kurdish New Year observed on 21 March (the Spring equinox) as a celebration of newness and reconciliation. It is celebrated by many modern Turkic peoples as well. Apart from the original beliefs of the Zoroastrians regarding the New Year, Alevis also celebrate and commemorate the birth of Ali, his wedding with Fatima, the rescue of Yusuf from the well, and the creation of the world on this day. Various cem ceremonies and special programs are held. Mourning of Muharram[edit] The grave of Husayn at Karbala. Main article: Mourning of Muharram The Muslim month of Muharram begins 20 days after Eid ul-Adha (Kurban Bayramı). Alevis observe a fast for the first twelve days. This is called "Turkish: Muharrem Mâtemi", "Turkish: Yâs-ı Muharrem" or "Turkish: Mâtem Orucu" (Mourning of Muharram). This culminates in the festival of Ashura (Aşure), which commemorates the martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala. The fast is broken with a special dish (also called aşure) prepared from a variety (often twelve) of fruits, nuts, and grains. Many events are associated with this celebration, including the salvation of Husayn's son Ali ibn Husayn from the massacre at Karbala, thus allowing the bloodline of the family of Muhammad to continue. Hıdırellez[edit] A Persian miniature depicting Elijah and al-Khiḍr (A miniature version of Stories of the Prophets). Main articles: Hıdırellez and Khidr Hıdırellez honors the mysterious figure Khidr (Turkish: Hızır) who is sometimes identified with Elijah (Ilyas), and is said to have drunk of the water of life. Some hold that Khidr comes to the rescue of those in distress on land, while Elijah helps those at sea; and that they meet at a rose tree in the evening of every 6 May. The festival is also celebrated in parts of the Balkans by the name of "Erdelez," where it falls on the same day as Đurđevdan or St. George's Day. Khidr is also honored with a three-day fast in mid-February called Hızır Orucu. In addition to avoiding any sort of comfort or enjoyment, Alevis also abstain from food and water for the entire day, though they do drink liquids other than water during the evening. Note that the dates of the Khidr holidays can differ among Alevis, most of whom use a lunar calendar, but some a solar calendar. Müsahiplik[edit] Main article: Müsahiplik Müsahiplik (roughly, "Companionship") is a covenant relationship between two men of the same age, preferably along with their wives. In a ceremony in the presence of a dede the partners make a lifelong commitment to care for the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of each other and their children. The ties between couples who have made this commitment is at least as strong as it is for blood relatives, so much so that müsahiplik is often called spiritual brotherhood (manevi kardeşlik). The children of covenanted couples may not marry.[40] Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi reports that the Tahtacı identify müsahiplik with the first gate (şeriat), since they regard it as a precondition for the second (tarikat). Those who attain to the third gate (marifat, "gnosis") must have been in a müsahiplik relationship for at least twelve years. Entry into the third gate dissolves the müsahiplik relationship (which otherwise persists unto death), in a ceremony called Öz Verme Âyini ("ceremony of giving up the self"). The value corresponding to the second gate (and necessary to enter the third) is âşinalık ("intimacy," perhaps with God). Its counterpart for the third gate is called peşinelik; for the fourth gate (hâkikat, Ultimate Truth), cıngıldaşlık or cengildeşlik (translations uncertain).[41] Folk practices[edit] Main articles: Eyüp Sultan Mosque, Ziyarat, Dua, and Lokma It is a common Alevi-Sunni tradition to distribute lokma publicly in Turkey. Many folk practices may be identified, though few of them are specific to the Alevis. In this connection, scholar Martin van Bruinessen notes a sign from Turkey's Ministry of Religion, attached to Istanbul's shrine of Eyüp Sultan, which presents...a long list of ‘superstitious’ practices that are emphatically declared to be non-Islamic and objectionable, such as lighting candles or placing ‘wishing stones’ on the tomb, tying pieces of cloth to the shrine or to the trees in front of it, throwing money on the tomb, asking the dead directly for help, circling seven times around the trees in the courtyard or pressing one’s face against the walls of the türbe in the hope of a supernatural cure, tying beads to the shrine and expecting supernatural support from them, sacrificing roosters or turkeys as a vow to the shrine. The list is probably an inventory of common local practices the authorities wish to prevent from re-emerging.[42]Other, similar practices include kissing door frames of holy rooms; not stepping on the threshold of holy buildings; seeking prayers from reputed healers; and making lokma and sharing it with others. Ziyarat to sacred places[edit] Holy ziyarat placesThe tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari is a place of ziyarat at the Eyüp Sultan Mosque in Eyüp, Istanbul.Karacaahmet Cemetery in Istanbul, Turkey. Main articles: Hacıbektaş, Battal Gazi, Karacaahmet Cemetery, and Şahkulu Performing ziyarat and du'a at the tombs of Alevi-Bektashi saints or pirs is quite common. Some of the most frequently visited sites are the shrines of Şahkulu and Karacaahmet (both in Istanbul), Abdal Musa (Antalya), Battal Gazi (Eskişehir), the annual celebrations held at Hacıbektaş (16 August) and Sivas (the Pir Sultan Abdal Kültür Etkinlikleri, 23–24 June). In contrast with the traditional secrecy of the Cem ceremony ritual, the events at these cultural centers and sites are open to the public. In the case of the Hacibektaş celebration, since 1990 the activities there have been taken over by Turkey's Ministry of Culture in the interest of promoting tourism and Turkish patriotism rather than Alevi spirituality. Some Alevis make pilgrimages to mountains and other natural sites believed to be imbued with holiness. Further information: Pir (Sufism) and Pir Sultan Abdal Almsgiving[edit] Main articles: Dergah, Vakıf, and Zakat Alevis are expected to give Zakat but not in the Orthodox-Islamic sense rather there is no set formula or prescribed amount for annual charitable donation as there is in Orthodox Islam (2.5% of possessions above a certain minimum). Rather, they are expected to give the 'excess' according to Qur'an verse 2:219. A common method of Alevi almsgiving is through donating food (especially sacrificial animals) to be shared with worshippers and guests. Alevis also donate money to be used to help the poor, to support the religious, educational and cultural activities of Alevi centers and organizations (dergâh, vakıf, dernek), and to provide scholarships for students. Society[edit] Leadership structure[edit] In contrast to the Bektashi tariqa, which like other Sufi orders is based on a silsila "initiatory chain or lineage" of teachers and their students, Alevi leaders succeed to their role on the basis of family descent. Perhaps ten percent of Alevis belong to a religious elite called ocak "hearth", indicating descent from Ali and/or various other saints and heroes. Ocak members are called ocakzades or "sons of the hearth". This system apparently originated with Safavid Persia. Alevi leaders are variously called murshid, pir, rehber or dede. Groups that conceive of these as ranks of a hierarchy (as in the Bektashi tariqa) disagree as to the order. The last of these, dede "grandfather", is the term preferred by the scholarly literature. Ocakzades may attain to the position of dede on the basis of selection (by a father from among several sons), character, and learning. In contrast to Alevi rhetoric on the equality of the sexes, it is generally assumed that only males may fill such leadership roles. Traditionally Dedes did not merely lead rituals, but led their communities, often in conjunction with local notables such as the ağas (large landowners) of the Dersim Region. They also acted as judges or arbiters, presiding over village courts called Düşkünlük Meydanı. Ordinary Alevi would owe allegiance to a particular dede lineage (but not others) on the basis of pre-existing family or village relations. Some fall instead under the authority of Bektashi dargah (lodges). In the wake of 20th century urbanization (which removed young laborers from the villages) and socialist influence (which looked upon the Dedes with suspicion), the old hierarchy has largely broken down. Many Dedes now receive salaries from Alevi cultural centers, which arguably subordinates their role. Such centers no longer feature community business or deliberation, such as the old ritual of reconciliation, but emphasize musical and dance performance to the exclusion of these.[43] Dedes are now approached on a voluntary basis, and their role has become more circumscribed – limited to religious rituals, research, and giving advice.

Position of women[edit] According to John Shindeldecker "Alevis are proud to point out that they are monogamous, Alevi women are encouraged to get the best education they can, and Alevi women are free to go into any occupation they choose."[44] Relations with other Muslim groups[edit] Alevis are classified as a sect of Shia Islam,[45] as Alevis accept Twelver Shi‘a beliefs about Ali and the Twelve Imams, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed Alevis to be part of the Shia fold in the 1970s.[32] However, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals are appreciably different than those of mainstream, orthodox Ja'fari-Twelver Shi‘ah. According to more orthodox Shia Muslims, Alevis are labeled as "Batiniyya" groups since Alevis praise Ali beyond what mainstream Shia Muslims expect. According to Alevis, Ali and Muhammad are likened to the two sides of a coin, or the two halves of an apple. Sufi elements in Alevism[edit] Further information: Qalandariyya and Qutb ad-Dīn Haydar Despite this essentially Shi‘i orientation, much of Aleviness' mystical language is inspired by Sufi traditions. For example, the Alevi concept of God is derived from the philosophy of Ibn Arabi and involves a chain of emanation from God, to spiritual man, earthly man, animals, plants, and minerals. The goal of spiritual life is to follow this path in the reverse direction, to unity with God, or Haqq (Reality, Truth). From the highest perspective, all is God (see Wahdat-ul-Wujood). Alevis admire Mansur Al-Hallaj, a 10th-century Sufi who was accused of blasphemy and subsequently executed in Baghdad for saying "I am the Truth" (Ana al-Haqq). There is some tension between folk tradition Aleviness and the Bektashi Order, which is a Sufi order founded on Alevi beliefs.[46] In certain Turkish communities other Sufi orders (the Halveti-Jerrahi and some of the Rifa'i) have incorporated significant Alevi influence. Relations with majority Sunnis[edit] The relationship between Alevis and Sunnis is one of mutual suspicion and prejudice dating back to the Ottoman period. Hundreds of Alevis were murdered in sectarian violence in the years that preceded the 1980 coup, and as late as the 1990s dozens were killed with impunity.[5] While pogroms have not occurred since them, the Erdogan has declared “a cemevi is not a place of worship, it is a center for cultural activities. Muslims should only have one place of worship.”[5] Alevis claim that they have been subject to intolerant Sunni "nationalism" that has been unwilling to recognize Alevi "uniqueness."[47] History[edit] Main article: Alevi history Alevis have been victims of pogroms during both Ottoman times and under the Turkish republic up until the 1990.[5][48][49] Seljuk period[edit] During the great Turkish expansion from Central Asia into Iran and Anatolia in the Seljuk period (11–12th centuries), Turkmen nomad tribes accepted a Sufi and pro-Ali form of Islam that co-existed with some of their pre-Islamic customs. Their conversion to Islam in this period was achieved largely through the efforts not of textual scholars (ulema) expounding the finer points of Koranic exegesis and shari‘a law, but by charismatic Sufi dervishes whose cult of Muslim saint worship, mystical divination and millenarianism spoke more directly to the steppe mindset. These tribes dominated Anatolia for centuries with their religious warriors (ghazi) spearheading the drive against Byzantines and Crusaders.[50] Further information: Ak Koyunlu and Kara Koyunlu Ottoman period[edit] Further information: Ottoman persecution of Alevis, Kızılbaş, Şahkulu, and Shahkulu Uprising As in Khorasan and West Asia before, the Turkmens who spearheaded the Ottomans’ drive into the Balkans and West Asia were more inspired by a vaguely Shiite folk Islam than by formal religion. Many times, Ottoman campaigns were accompanied or guided by Bektaşi dervishes, spiritual heirs of the 13th century Sufi saint Haji Bektash Veli, himself a native of Khorasan. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman state became increasingly determined to assert its fiscal but also its juridical and political control over the farthest reaches of the Empire. The resulting Qizilbash revolts, a series of millenarian anti-state uprisings by the heterodox Turkmen population of Anatolia that culminated in the establishment of a militantly Shiite rival state in neighbouring Iran.[50] The Ottoman Empire later proclaimed themselves its defenders against the Safavid Shia state and related sects. This created a gap between the Sunni Ottoman ruling elite and the Alevi Anatolian population. Anatolia became a battlefield between Safavids and Ottomans, each determined to include it in their empire. Republic[edit] According to Eren Sarı, Alevi saw Kemal Atatürk as a Mahdi "savior sent to save them from the Sunni Ottoman yoke".[33] However, pogroms against Alevi did not cease after the establishment of Atatürk's republic. In attacks against leftists in the 1970s, ultranationalists and reactionaries killed many Alevis. Malatya in 1978, Maraş in 1979, and Çorum in 1980 witnessed the murder of hundreds of Alevis, the torching of hundreds of homes, and lootings.[48][49] When he came to power in 2003, then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initially promised to strengthen the rights of minorities. In 2007 he began an “Alevi opening,” and has protected Alevi from massacres.[5] But the Erdogan government also emphasizes the teaching of Sunni doctrine in public schools,[5] has placed few Alevis in government positions such as governor or police chief; and while it spends large sums for the construction of Sunni mosques, refuses to classify cemevis as official places of worship, let alone pay for their construction.[5] In October 2013, tens of thousands of Alevis protested the lack of Alevi rights in a series of reforms introduced by Erdoğan.[7] In 2015 a cemevi was confiscated and repurposed as a mosque, despite the presence of another mosque a few hundred metres away.[5] In 2016 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found that Alevis in Turkey "were subjected to a difference in treatment for which there was no objective and reasonable justification."[51] Demographics[edit] Distribution of Alevi population in Turkey. Red = Anatolian Alevis (Turks, Kurmanjis and Zazas). Dark red = Alawites (Arabs) in Southern Turkey. Most Alevi live in Turkey, where they are a minority and Sunni Muslims the majority. The size of the Alevi population is likewise disputed, but most estimates place them somewhere between 8 and 10 million people or about 12% of the population.[52][53] Estimates of the percentage of Turkey's population that are Alevi include between 10 and 20%,[5] 33%,[54] and as much as 40%.[54] Scattered minorities live in Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Caucasus, Greece, Iran and the Turkish Diaspora.[55] Most Alevis come from Kizilbash or Bektashi origin, according to Minorityrights.org. The Alevis (Kizilbash) are traditionally predominantly rural and acquire identity by parentage. Bektashis, however, are predominantly urban, and formally claim that membership is open to any Muslim. The groups are separately organized, but subscribe to "virtually the same system of beliefs".[54] Population estimates[edit] The Alevi population has been estimated as follows: 12,521,000 according to Sabahat Akkiraz, an MP from CHP.[56] "approx. 15 million..." —Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi.[57] In Turkey, 15% of Turkey's population (approx. 10.6 million) —David Shankland[58] "Most Alevi writers and spokespersons claim that Turkey's population today is one-third Alevi-Bektashi, or more than 20 million. Lower estimates range from 10 to 12 million." —John Schindeldecker.[59] "The Alevi constitute the second-largest religious community in Turkey (following the Sunnis), and number some 25% (15 million) of the total population (Alevis claim 30%–40%). Most (?) Alevis are ethnic and linguistic Turks, mainly of Turkmen descent from Central and Eastern Anatolia. Some 20% of Alevis are Kurds (though most Kurds are Sunni), and some 25% of Kurds in Turkey are Alevi (Kurmanji and Zaza speakers)." —David Zeidan.[60] "8 to 10 million..." —Olli Rehn, from the 1996 (Camiel) "Eurlings Report" to the European Commission (on the suitability of Turkish accession to the EU). "...a world total of between 10 and 15 million adherents. There is no independent data for their numbers, so these statistics are estimates or conjectures." —"Alevism," from The Encyclopedia of the Orient. In June 2008, several Turkish newspapers reported that the Turkish military had commissioned three universities to research the ethnic demography of Turkey. The study was done in 2000 and included all ethnic groupings. According to the results, the Alevi population of Turkey, including those who currently reside in Europe, is around 10 million. Conglomeration of syncretic beliefs: A wide variety of academic sources define Alevism as a syncretic religion, combining diverse religious beliefs,[61][62][63] which developed from Islam, Buddhist-influenced Turkic shamanism, and some elements of Christianity.[64][65][66] According to Turkish university research conducted in 2005 by a researcher named Soner Cagaptay, 44% of respondents who called themselves "Alevis" self-identify as Muslim and 56% do not.[67] Nevertheless, one should be aware of the fact that the university survey which was conducted at a specific location may not reflect the accurate results all the time, and there exists a high probability that the group who had been surveyed might belong to the non-Muslim Ishikists. Moreover, one should always bear in mind that some members of the non-muslim communities like Kurdish Yâresân (Ahl-i Haqq) and Ishik-Alevis define/identify themselves under the title of Alawism as well. Henceforth, it is always possible either to enlarge or to shrink the borders of the Alevism with respect to which of these definitions are going to be used. Alevis have been subjected to persecution (often deadly) for centuries. Due to this fact, some have been assimilated. It is not clear how effective the above study is in including those who might be more timid about advertising their Alevi origins. Some of the Kurdish Alevis speak Kurmanji or Zazaki. Some Alevis are Azeris.[68] Despite universalist rhetoric and in contrast with Islam in general, or the Bektashi order, Alevi communities do not generally acknowledge the possibility of conversion to Aleviness. Alevi communities are concentrated in central Anatolia, in a belt from Çorum in the west to Muş in the east. The only province within Turkey with an Alevi majority is Tunceli, formerly known as Dersim. Beginning in the 1960s, many Alevis have migrated to the large cities of western and southern Turkey – and to western Europe, especially Germany – and are now heavily urbanized. There is also a native 3000 Alevi community in Western Thrace, Greece.[69] The founder of the Bektashiyyah Sufi order Hacı Bektaş-ı Veli (Ḥājjī Baktāsh Walī), a murid of Malāmatī-Qalāndārī Sheikh Qutb ad-Dīn Haydar, who introduced the Ahmad Yasavi's doctrine of "Four Doors and Forty Stending" into his tariqah. Social groups[edit] A Turkish scholar working in France has distinguished four main groups among contemporary Alevis, which cautiously show their distinctive features in modern Turkey.[70] Calligraphic hat in Alevi-Bektashism. The first group, who form majority of the Alevi population regard themselves as true Muslims and are prepared to cooperate with the state. It adheres to the way of Jafar as-Sadiq, the Sixth Imam of Shia Islam. This groups, concept of God is the same as Orthodox Islam, and like their Shia counterparts they reject the first three chosen Caliph's, who Sunni's accept as legitimate and only accept Ali as the actual and true Caliph.[70] The second group, which has the second most following among Alevis are said to be under the active influence of the official Iranian Shia's and to be confirmed adherents of the Twelver branch of Shia Islam and they reject the teachings of Bektashism Tariqa. They follow the Ja'fari jurisprudence and oppose secular state power.[70] The third group a minority belief held by the Alevis is mainly represented by people who belong to the political left and presumed the Aleviness just as an outlook on the individual human life rather than a religious conviction by persistently renouncing the ties of the Batiniyya-Alevism with Twelver political branch of Shia Islam. The followers of this congregation, who later turned out to be the very stern defenders of Erdoğan Çınar, hold ritual unions of a religious character and have established cultural associations named after Pir Sultan Abdal as well. According to their philosophy, human being should enjoy a central role reminiscent of the doctrine of Khurramites, and as illustrated by Hurufi phrase of God is Man quoted above in the context of the Trinity.[70] The fourth[citation needed]who adopted some aspirations of Christian mysticism, is more directed towards heterodox mysticism and stands closer to the Hajji Bektashi Brotherhood. According to the philosophy developed by this congregation, Christian mystic St Francis of Assisi and Hindu Mahatma Gandhi are supposedly considered better believers of God than many Muslims.[70] Further information: Ja'fari, Nusayrism, Hurufism, and Chinarism Influences of the Muslim sects on the Alevī faith throughout Anatolia and the Balkans[edit] Main articles: Qutb ad-Dīn Haydar, Bektaşi, Hajji Bektash, Kızılbaş, and Tariqat The influences of the Muslim sects on the Alevī faith throughout Anatolia and the Balkans The schematic history of the development of the Imāmī-Alevism Malāmat’īyyahPolytheismIslam BuddhismHinduismTengriismKharijitesShiʿismTasawwufSunni[71] AnimismShaman’īyyahTotemismBatin’īyyahShiʿaGhulatHanafiMalikiShafi'iHanbaliẒāhirī Qālandar’īyyahWafā’īyyahQāddāh’īyyahIsmā‘īl’īyyahIthnā‘āshar’īyyahZu al-NūnIbn AdhamAsh-ShādhilīAbu al-Najib Ishaq’īyyah[72]Nezār’īyyahIsmā‘īl’i`Shi'aZaid’īyyahSaba’īyyahBastāmīShādhilī’yyahSuhraward’īyyah Bābā’īyyah[72]Sābbāh’īyyahMustā‘līyyahDa‘ī al-kabīrSevenersQarmatiansKharaqānīAbu Hafs Umar Yassaw’īyyah Tariqa Alamut StateTurkestan AlevismNāsir KhusrawThe Twelve Imams[73]Kaysān’īyyahSahl al-TūstārīArslan BabaYusūf Hamadānī Anatolian AlevismAlāvidsDā’ī Kabīr al-Nāṣir li’l-HaqqSāfav’īyyah TariqaBūʿmūslim’īyyahMansur Al-HallajAhmed-i YassawiAbd’ūl`Khaliq GajadwaniAbd’ūl`Qadir Gilani Haydār’īyyah TariqaSāfavidsShāh IsmāʿīlShaykh HaydarTwelver`Shi'aIshaq al-Turk’īyyahFażlu l-Lāh Astar`ĀbādīNāqshband’īyyah TariqaQādir’īyyah TariqaSheikh’ūl`Akbar Ibn ʿArabī Sāfav’īyyah-KızılbaşBābak’īyyahKhurrām’īyyahMukannaʿīyyahSunbādh’īyyahHurūf’īyyah[74] TariqaZāhed’īyyah TariqaAkbar’īyyah Sūfīsm Hājjı BektshQizilbash[75]Kul NesîmîPir SultanGül BabaBalım SultanNāsīmīKhālwat’īyyahWāhdat’ūl`Wūjood Yunus EmreAbdal MūsāKaygusuz AbdalBaktāsh’īyyah TariqaBaktāshi folk religion[76]Bāyrām’īyyah TariqaHacı Bayram-ı Veli Bektashi[edit] Main article: Bektashiyyah The Bektashiyyah is a Shia Sufi order founded in the 13th century by Haji Bektash Veli, a dervish who escaped Central Asia and found refuge with the Seljuks in Anatolia at the time of the Mongol invasions (1219–23). This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the Celebi clan, who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called Bel evladları (children of the loins), and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the Babağan, those faithful to the path (yol evladları – children of the way) who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership.[31] Bektashiyyah doctrine: Bektashism and Hurufism[edit] Main articles: Mysticism, Four Doors, Hajji Bektash Wali, Sharia, Tariqa, Haqiqa, and Marifa The Bektashi Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide – called a baba in Bektashi parlance – as well as the doctrine of "the four gates that must be traversed": the "Sharia" (religious law), "Tariqah" (the spiritual path), "Marifa" (true knowledge), "Haqiqah" (truth). Wahdat al-Mawjud[edit] Main article: Wahdat al-mawjud Four Spiritual Stations in Bektashiyyah: Sharia, tariqa, haqiqa, and the fourth station, marifa, which is considered "unseen", is actually the center of the haqiqa region. Marifa is the essence of all four stations. Bektashism places much emphasis on the concept of Wahdat al-Mawjud وحدة الوجود, the "Unity of Being" that was formulated by Ibn Arabi. Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked veneration of Ali, the Twelve Imams, and the ritual commemoration of Ashurah marking the Battle of Karbala. The old Persian holiday of Nowruz is celebrated by Bektashis as Imam Ali's birthday. In keeping with the central belief of Wahdat Al-Mawjud the Bektashi see reality contained in Haqq-Muhammad-Ali, a single unified entity. Bektashi do not consider this a form of trinity. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (muhabbet) and yearly confession of sins to a baba (magfirat-i zunub مغفرة الذنوب). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and mystical interpretation and understanding of the Qur'an and the prophetic practice (Sunnah). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali and Jelalludin Rumi who are close in spirit to them.

Main articles: Batiniyya and Ismailism Bektashis hold that the Qur'an has two levels of meaning: an outer (Zāher ظاهر) and an inner (bāṭen باطن).[6] They hold the latter to be superior and eternal and this is reflected in their understanding of both the universe and humanity, which is a view that can also be found in Ismailism and Batiniyya.[25] Bektashism is also initiatic and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the Reality. First level members are called aşıks عاشق. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called nasip) one becomes a mühip محب. After some time as a mühip, one can take further vows and become a dervish. The next level above dervish is that of baba. The baba (lit. father) is considered to be the head of a tekke and qualified to give spiritual guidance (irshad إرشاد). Above the baba is the rank of halife-baba (or dede, grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the "dedebaba" (great-grandfather). The dedebaba was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the dedebaba was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hacıbektaş (Solucakarahüyük).

Qizilbash[edit] Main articles: Qizilbash and Safavids The Qizilbash (red-heads) were Turkmen tribes who adhered to the Safavid Sufi Order, whose Sheikhs claimed descent from Ali. Under Isma`il (d. 1524) they became dominant in Eastern Anatolia and conquered Azerbaijan with its capital Tabriz, where Isma`il named himself Shah in 1501 and went on to conquer all of Iran. His missionaries spread a message of revolt against the Sunni Ottomans in Anatolia, claiming that Isma`il was the awaited mahdi (messiah), and Anatolia became the scene of protracted warfare between Ottomans and Safavids.[31] Qizilbash doctrine: Kızılbaşlık[edit] Qizilbash and Bektashi tariqah shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as Alevis in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Qizilbash and Bektashi developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, all members of Alevism developed a tradition of opposition (ibāḥa) to all forms of external religion.[31] The doctrine of Qizilbashism is well explained in the following poem written by the Shaykh of Safaviyya tariqah Ismail I: من داها نسنه بيلمه زه م / Mən daha nəsnə bilməzəm, // I don't know any other object, آللاه بير محممد على́دير / Allah bir Məhəmməd Əlidir. // Allah is unique Muhammad-Ali. اؤزوم غوربتده سالمازام / Özüm qürbəttə salmazam, // I can't let out my own essence to places far from my homeland, آللاه بير محممد على́دير / Allah bir Məhəmməd Əlidir. // Allah is unique Muhammad-Ali. اونلار بيردير، بير اولوبدور / Onlar birdir, bir olubdur, // They are unique, a single one, i.e. Haqq-Muhammad-Ali, يئردن گؤيه نور اولوبدور / Yerdən göyə nur olubdur, // It's a nūr from Earth to Sky, دؤرد گوشه ده سيرر اولوبدور، / Dörd guşədə sirr olubdur, // It's a mysterious occult secret in every corner of the square, آللاه بير محممد على́دير / Allah bir Məhəmməd Əlidir. // Allah is unique Muhammad-Ali. ختايى بو يولدا سردير / Xətai bu yolda sirdir, // Khatai in this tariqah is a mysterious occult secret, سرين وئره نلر ده اردير / Sirrin verənlər də ərdir, // Those reveal their own secret are private as well, آيدا سيردير، گونده نوردور / Ayda sirdir, gündə nurdur, // Secret on Moon, nūr on Sun, آللاه بير محممد على́دير / Allah bir Məhəmməd Əlidir. // Allah is unique Muhammad-Ali. The lines of poetry above may easily be judged as an act of "Shirk" (polytheism) by the Sunni Ulama, but they have a bāṭenī[6] taʾwīl (inner explanation) in Qizilbashism.

Alevi religious services, referred to collectively as cem or âyîn, include spiritual exercises that incorporate elements of zikr ("remembrance" or recitation of God's names, in this case without controlled breathing, but with some elements of body posturing) and sema (ritual dance). The latter is accompanied by sung mystical poetry in the vernacular, and by the sacred ritual instrument known as bağlama or saz (a plucked folk lute with frets). Such music is performed by specialists known as zâkir, aşık, sazende or güvende, depending on regional usage. They are recruited from Alevi communities and descended from dede lineages. Many are also known to be poet/minstrels (aşık, ozan) who perpetuate the tradition of dervish-lodge (tekke) poets such as Yunus Emre (13th century), Nesîmî (14th century), Pir Sultan Abdal, Hatâ'î and Genç Abdal (16th century) and Kul Himmet and Kul Hüseyn (17th century). The poetry was composed in the Turkish vernacular and follows the principles of folk prosody known as hece vezne in which the focus is the number of syllables. The tomb of Ruhi Su at Zincirlikuyu Mezarlığı in Istanbul. The specialized sacred musical repertoire of Alevi musicians includes Deyiş (songs of mystical love) Nefes (hymns concerning the mystical experience) Düvaz or dıwes imâm (hymns in honor of the 12 Alid imams) Mersiye (laments concerning the martyrdom of Imam Huseyn at Karbala) Miraçlama (songs about the ascent of the Muhammad to heaven) Samāh (ritual dance accompanied by folk lutes and sung poetry) The dances are performed by couples, and choreographies employ circle and line formations as well as arrangements where couples face one another, thus synchronizing their movements more closely. As the tempo of the music increases, the figures become more complex and intense. There are many regional variants of sema, but the most widespread and important are the Dance of the Forty (Kırklar Semahı) and the Dance of the Cranes (Turnalar Semahı). The âyîn-î-cem can be heard on the JVC CD Turkey – An Esoteric Sufi Ceremony. The recording was made in Istanbul in 1993, and the ceremony includes in an order typical of a cem: a deyiş that reiterates the line of descent of the sect in a historical framework, two divas (one based on the poetry of Hatâ'î, and the other on the poetry of Kul Himmet), prayer formulas, the ill-Âllâh genre that incorporates the tahlîl formula into the poem to create an atmosphere of zikr while sect members create rhythmic intensity by hitting their knees in time to the music and sway their bodies slightly, the Dance of the Forty (Kırklar Semah), the Dance of the Cranes (Turnalar Semahı) and prayer formulas. Alevis have a significant role in Turkish music and poetry. Pir Sultan Abdal, a 16th-century Alevi poet whose poems and songs often contain spiritual themes, is revered as a saint and hero. Important figures are the Sufi poet Yunus Emre, widely regarded as having been Alevi, and Kaygusuz Abdal. Their poems shape Turkish culture up to now, and are also performed by modern artists. Songs attributed to these poets have been embraced by left-wingers in the 20th century. The aşık bards are also influenced by Alevi tradition. Many of the major traditional musicians in Turkey are Alevi, including Arif Sağ, Musa Eroğlu, Neşet Ertaş,[77] Erdal Erzincan, Aşık Mahzuni Şerif, Aşık Feyzullah Çınar, Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu, Ali Ekber Çiçek, Sabahat Akkiraz, Belkıs Akkale, and Ulaş Özdemir. Other non-Alevis, such as Ruhi Su, have recorded many Alevi songs. Mercan Dede, an artist whose music combines electronic and traditional Sufi elements, has made some songs involving Alevi themes in cooperation with singer Sabahat Akkiraz.

E. van VogtCover artistRic BinkleyCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishGenreScience fictionPublisherGnome PressPublication date1952Media typePrint (hardback)Pages223 The Mixed Men is a fix-up novel of science fiction short stories by Canadian-American writer A. E. van Vogt that focus on the mixed offspring of Dellian Supermen and human beings.[1] The novel's title is taken from van Vogt's 1945 Astounding SF short story "Mixed Men", which was nominated for a Retro-Hugo Award in 1996.[2] The stories published in the novel were originally released between the years of 1943 to 1945 in Astounding SF,[3] with the novel being first published in a 5,000 copy printing in 1952 by Gnome Press and a 1955 Berkley Books edition under the title Mission to the Stars.[4] The novel is an early example of "fix-up" literature where several stories are re-written to make one cohesive novel.[4] Contents 1 Contents 2 Reception 3 References 4 Further reading 5 External links Contents[edit] "Concealment" "The Storm" "The Mixed Men" "Lost: Fifty Suns" "Is it true?" Reception[edit] Reception for the novel was negative, with a 1952 reviewer for the New York Times calling it a "bad parody" of science fiction and high adventure.[5] P. Schuyler Miller in Astounding Science Fiction (1952) found the novel to be "distinctly minor van Vogt" and that the protagonist "isn't very convincing."[6] Author Bob Shaw later cited that one of the stories in the novel sparked his interest in the science fiction genre, stating that the "reading of that first story changed the entire course of my life".[7] References[edit] ^ Westfahl, Gary (2009).

It lives on the islands Ladigue, Felicite and Cocco in the Seychelles, and typically inhabits trees and dwellings. The Seychelles giant day gecko feeds on insects and nectar. Contents 1 Description 2 Distribution 3 Habitat 4 Diet 5 Behaviour 6 Reproduction 7 Care and maintenance in captivity 8 References Description[edit] This lizard is a large day gecko. It can reach a total length of about 16 cm. The body color is bright green or bluish green. A faint red stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. On the back there are irregularly shaped reddish dots and bars present which can be quite variable in appearance. These geckos have yellow eye rings. The throat is yellow. The ventral side is yellowish white or yellow. Distribution[edit] This species is found on the islands La Digue, Felicité and Cocco in the Seychelles. Habitat[edit] Phelsuma sundbergi ladiguensis is often found on different large trees such coconut palms. This species also lives near or on human dwellings. Diet[edit] These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar. Behaviour[edit] While feeding, these geckos aid in the pollination of palm trees by transferring pollen between female and male trees. Reproduction[edit] The females of this species are colony nesters and more than 50 eggs can be found at one location. At a temperature of 28 °C, the juveniles will hatch after approximately 56–71 days. Care and maintenance in captivity[edit] These animals should be housed singly or in pairs. Unpaired P. sundbergi ladiguensis are prone to fighting, sometimes causing significant injury or death if not quickly removed. This is a skittish species that should not be handled and is prone to escape. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28 °C during the day. The humidity should be maintained around 65–75% during the day and slightly higher at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies. A commercial powered Crested Gecko diet (made by Repashy and mixed with water), supplemented with occasional insects, works well and supports breeding. This diet works well for most fruit/nectar-eating geckos. References[edit] Henkel, F.-W. and W. Schmidt (1995) Amphibien und Reptilien Madagaskars, der Maskarenen, Seychellen und Komoren.

The 3000 square-meter pavilion was designed by Swedish architectural firm Sweco according to the Swedish theme of “The Spirit of Innovation”. The total budget for the Swedish pavilion was around 150 million SEK, slightly more than half of which was contributed by the Swedish business sector.[1] Commissioner General for the Swedish pavilion was Annika Rembe. Construction of the Swedish pavilion began on the April 20, 2009[2] and the pavilion was officially inaugurated on May 1, 2010, the day of the World Expo’s opening. Contents 1 Themes 2 Architecture 3 Exhibition 4 Visitors and activities 5 References 6 External links Themes[edit] The overall theme of the Swedish participation in the Shanghai Expo 2010 was “The Spirit of Innovation”. The architecture of the pavilion, the exhibition, and the activities hosted by the pavilion during the Expo were all grounded in this theme. With the official keywords sustainability, innovation and communication, this theme aimed to showcase Sweden as a nation of problem solvers, specifically in the sphere of urban environment and the quality of everyday life.[3] According to General Commissioner Annika Rembe, the pavilion showed how Sweden has managed to develop so far, stressing Swedish ways of working, especially cooperation and a faith in creativity.[4] One of the most important symbols for the Swedish pavilion was the cartoon character Pippi Longstocking. According to exhibition designer Carin Lembre, in order to be innovative like Alfred Nobel, you need to be creative like Pippi Longstocking. “The Spirit of Inspiration is created when, like Pippi, you dare to be brave, dare to try new ways of thinking and dare to make mistakes.”[5] Architecture[edit] The design of the pavilion was submitted by the Swedish architectural firm Sweco, under the supervision of chief architects Johannes Tüll and Christer Stenmark.[6] It was a three-storey construction made up of four separate cube-like structures connected by elevated walkways. The first and second floors house the public exhibition, while the entire third floor was dedicated to conference areas and related facilities. A small café and a souvenir shop were located on the first floor. One of the most distinguishing design features was the laminated-wood outdoor atrium of the entrance hall, along with the roof-top glass-floor bar situated on top of it. The outside design combines an outer steel shell representing the street network of Stockholm with large panorama photography of Swedish forests on the inward-facing outer wall surfaces. This design was grounded in the concept of a meeting between city, nature and mankind.[7] Exhibition[edit] The Swedish exhibition was designed by communication and design agencies Springtime, Futurniture and Tengom architects as a walk through five halls of the Swedish pavilion, aimed to introduce the country of Sweden from the perspectives of sustainability and innovation. The entrance of the pavilion, the Swedish Atmosphere Hall, contained images of Swedish people and nature. The second exhibition hall, the Hall of Environmental Challenges, introduced some cases of environmental problems faced by Sweden and the solutions that had already been implemented towards them. The third hall, the Hall of Solutions, showed examples of products to be found in an ecologically sustainable city and a hands-on kitchen that demonstrates the contributions everyone can make to the environment. From this hall, one of the pavilion’s most popular attractions, a giant slide, led down to the Hall of Spirit of Innovation, where fifty Swedish inventions and designs were displayed on pictures.[8] This hall also contains a number of swings that visitors could try, and aimed to deliver the message that true innovation comes from play. The last exhibition hall, the Innovative Society Hall, let visitors interact with machines and also featured the flexible space of the “Innovation Stage”, where activities and competitions were held at regular intervals. Visitors and activities[edit] By mid-September, the Swedish pavilion had received over two million visitors.[9] Except for the permanent exhibition, for the duration of the World Expo, several activities on sustainability and innovation were organized by the Swedish pavilion, including a SymbioCity forum, discussing the cities of the future, and a children’s literature seminar.[10][11] References[edit] ^ "Shanghai öppnar sig för världen". ^ "Sweden to promote spirit of innovation". ^ "Sweden pavilion". ^ "Hon styr Sverigebilden". ^ "Pippi visar vägen till Spirit of Innovation". ^ "The Swedish pavilion". ^ "The Swedish pavilion: Concept". ^ "Exploring the pavilion: Spirit of Innovation wall". ^ "Video: 2 000 000th visitor of the Swedish pavilion". ^ "Children's literature in focus at the Swedish pavilion". ^ "Sustainable cities Swedish theme at Expo 2010 in Shanghai".

It was founded in 1990 in Berkeley, California and remains in operation, having survived the decline of CD sales in the 2000s.[1] Contents 1 History 2 YouTube channel 3 Popular culture 4 Gallery 5 References 6 External links History[edit] Founded by former employees of nearby Rasputin Records, Amoeba opened on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in 1990. Cofounders include but are not limited to Marc Weinstein, Dave Prinz, Yvonne Prinz, and Kent Randolph.[2] The San Francisco store opened on November 15, 1997 in the Haight-Ashbury district, near Golden Gate Park. It was located in the former 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) Park Bowl bowling alley.[1] It regularly stocks upwards of 100,000 CDs, vinyl records, and audio cassettes, both new and used.[citation needed] The Southern California location was added on November 17, 2001 when the store opened a new branch on Sunset Boulevard (at Cahuenga Boulevard) in Hollywood. At the time of its opening, the store planned to stock as many as 250,000 titles, which would have placed it among the largest independent music stores in the world.[citation needed] According to Los Angeles Times writer Michael Hiltzik, the location "instantly became a Hollywood landmark."[3] Documents published by the Los Angeles Department of Planning in August 2017 indicate that the site will be demolished and replaced by a 28-story contemporary glass-and-steel tower with 232 residential units (including ten units for very low-income residents) and 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of ground-level commercial space.[4] Should the City approve the project, it was expected that construction would begin in mid-2019, and be completed in 2021.[4] On April 27, 2020, Amoeba announced that due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Hollywood location on Sunset Boulevard would not be reopening as hoped (to allow for final farewell events), but Amoeba would be relocating to their new Hollywood Boulevard location once they are permitted to reopen.[5] Amoeba's world music department was headed by Robert Leaver,[6] co-founder of the Round World Music record shop and label in San Francisco. He also worked as a buyer of international records for Amoeba's Berkeley location.[7] The stores also trade in movies, though secondarily to their music business. Each location has a smaller collection of movies on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc and Blu-ray Disc. In addition, each store maintains a selection of music-related posters and artwork for purchase, as well as Amoeba-branded merchandise. The Hollywood location has the entire 2nd floor dedicated to DVD and Blu-ray Disc. In addition, Amoeba Music frequently holds free shows during store hours with locally and nationally known artists from a wide variety of genres. Primarily operating on re-selling used goods, Amoeba has survived the decline of CD sales since the early 2000s with its trade-in program and the advent of the vinyl revival.[1] Along with the statewide stay-at-home order issued by California governor Gavin Newsom in the COVID-19 pandemic, many non-essential stores were told to close to prevent spread of COVID-19. Amoeba subsequently started a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe to pay the bills as most of their income is derived from in-store purchases.[8] YouTube channel[edit] Amoeba's YouTube channel was created on January 27, 2006 and is home to interviews, recordings of live performances at Amoeba locations, and the Webby Award-winning series “What’s In My Bag?” with various “featuring artists and tastemakers sharing what they found shopping at Amoeba.”[9] Popular culture[edit] The Hollywood store was included as a playable venue in the 2008 music game Guitar Hero World Tour.[1] Paul McCartney recorded his EP Amoeba's Secret at an unannounced live performance at the Hollywood location on 27 June 2007.

He is remembered as the manager of Gandhi's publications such as Navajivan and Young India and for having inspired Gandhi to pen his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth.[1] He wrote sketches, memoir, biographies, philosophy, travelogues and translated some works. Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early life 1.2 Gandhi's associate 1.3 Later life 2 Literary career 3 See also 4 References 4.1 Bibliography Biography[edit] Early life[edit] Swami Anand was born Himmatlal on 8 September 1887 at Shiyani village near Wadhwan to Ramchandra Dave (Dwivedi) and Parvati in Audichya Brahmin family. His father was a teacher. He was among seven siblings.[2] He was brought up and educated in Bombay. At the age of ten, he left home in opposition to marriage and due to an offer by monk to show him god. He wondered for three years with several different monks. He took a vow of renunciation while still in his teens, took on the name Swami Anandnand and became a monk with the Ramakrishna Mission. He also lived at the Advaita Ashram where he studied.[3][4][5] Anand's entry into the Indian independence movement was through his association with the revolutionaries of Bengal in 1905. Later, he worked in the Kesari, the Marathi newspaper founded by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, in 1907.[5][6] He was also involved in independence activities in rural regions. He also edited Gujarati edition of Marathi daily Rashtramat during the same period. When it was closed down, he travelled Himalayas in 1909. In 1912, he taught at the Hill Boys School in Almoda which was founded by Annie Besant.[5][2] Gandhi's associate[edit] Mahatma Gandhi first met Anand in Bombay on 10 January 1915, the day after he had returned from South Africa.[7] Gandhi launched his weekly, the Navjeevan from Ahmedabad four years later. Its inaugural issue came out in September 1919 and soon the workload increased. It was at this juncture that Gandhi sent for Anand to become the manager of the publication. Swami Anand took over its management in late 1919. He proved to be a good editor and manager and when the Young India was launched, he moved the publication to larger premises and with printing equipment donated by Mohammed Ali Jouhar, its publication began. In 18 March 1922, he was jailed for one and half years as a publisher for an article published in Young India.[5][8][2] Gandhi's autobiography was serialised in the Navjeevan from 1925 – 1928. It was written by Gandhi at Swami Anand's insistence and an English translation of these chapters appeared in installments in the Young India as well.[9][10] Later, The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi was published based on the talks Gandhi gave at the Satyagraha Ashram in Ahmedabad in 1926.[11] Swami Anand played a role in inspiring Gandhi to write this work as well.[12] He was Vallabhai Patel's secretary during the Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928. In 1930, he was again jailed for three years for participating in Salt Satyagraha at Vile Parle in Bombay. When he was released in 1933, he focused on the upliftment of the tribals and the unprivileged. He also founded the Ashrams in Bordi in Gujarat in 1931 followed by in Thane, Kausani and Kosbad.[5][2] He had also participated in relief work of the 1934 earthquake in north India and in the 1942 Quit India movement.[2] Following Partition in 1947, he worked amongst the refugees from Sialkot and Hardwar.[6] Later life[edit] After Independence, Swami Anand took an interest in agriculture and agrarian issues. He was concerned about agricultural productivity and livelihoods but had deep respect for the practical wisdom of small farmers. He was inspired by George Washington Carver and Robert Oppenheimer, whose biography he wrote. From 1957 to 1976, he made the Kosbad Agricultural Institute at Dahanu, near Bombay, his home.[13][6] He died on 25 January 1976 at 2:15 am in Bombay following heart attack.[2][5] Literary career[edit] Swami Anand was a polyglot, proficient in Gujarati, Marathi, Sanskrit, Hindi, Urdu and English. He was acquainted with the classical and folk traditions of the Gujarati, Marathi and Sanskrit languages and was influenced by the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Max Muller, Walt Whitman, Sri Aurobindo and Swami Vivekananda. Besides fiction, Swami Anand also wrote on issues of science, religion and society.[3] He had written memoirs, biographies, philosophies, travelogues and translations. Many of his works were published posthumously.[5] He has written several character sketches, biographical reflections and biographies of his friends and associates including Gandhijina Sansmarano (1963), Bhagwan Buddha (1964, co-written), Kulkathao (1966), Dharatinu Lun (1969), Motne Hamfavnara (1969), Santona Anuj (1971), Naghrol (1975), Santono Falo (1978).[5][3] Kulkathao, a series of pen portraits of people from the Bhatia caste, won him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1969, but, he refused to accept the award due to his vow not to accept any monetary benefits for his writings.[14][15][5] Gujarati writer and translator Mulshankar Bhatt has collected his best of the character sketches and published as Dharati Ni Arati (1977). In it, he has sketched the character of those people who had created a deep impression in his life. Some of the popular characters from it are Dhanima, Mahadev Desai, Vamandada and Dr. Mayadas.[16] His philosophical essay collections include Isunu Balidan (1922), Ishopnishad, Ishubhagwat (1977), Lokgeeta, Navla Darshan Ane Bija Lekho (1968), Manavtana Veri (1966), Anant Kala (1967), Atamna Mool (1967), Sarvoday Vicharana (co-written).[5] His Anant Kala is a meditation on nature and spirituality while his writing also covers the Upanishads and the Sarvodaya Movement extensively.[3] These essays share views on religion and society based on the concept of Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava which he had embraced.[5] He also produced travelogues based on his travels in the Himalayas which were published in Prasthan magazine between 1954 to 1960 and posthumously published in Uttarapathni Yatra and Baraf Raste Badrinath (1980). His translation of Sven Hedin's travel writing as Asiana Bhraman Ane Sanshodhan in Gujarati which was also published posthumously in 1979.[3][5] Bachpanna Bar Varsh (1982) his incomplete autobiographical work. Juni Moodi (1980) is a collection of proverbs and idioms.[5] Some of his other works include Ambavadiyun and Amaratvel and a compilation of correspondence between him and Gandhi's colleagues are contained in the Ugamani Dishano Ujas and Dhodhamar, all edited by Dinkar Joshi.[17] A biography of Swami Anand was written by Chandrakant Sheth[2] and he is the central character in Sujata Bhatt's poem, "Point No Point".[18] See also[edit] List of Gujarati-language writers References[edit] ^ "Autobiography".

U-nut type of speed nut, on the right, to be used with a self-tapping screw A speed nut, aka sheet metal nut or Tinnerman nut, is a type of locknut with two sheet metal prongs that act as one thread. They are made from spring steel. The fastener serves the functions of both a lock washer and a nut. As the fastener is tightened in the nut the prongs are drawn inward until they exert pressure on the root of the thread on the fastener. When the fastener is tightened, the base of the nut, which is arched, elastically deforms and applies a force to the fastener, which locks it from loosening under vibrations.[1] There are many different types of speed nuts, mostly dependent on the shape of the nut, how it attaches to the workpiece, and what type of screw can be used. Most types are designed for either machine screws or sheet metal screws. Some nuts do not attach to the workpiece. These are usually shaped as either a rectangle, a flange nut, or a hex nut; the rectangular speed nut is also known as a flat-style speed nut. Speed nuts that attach to the workpiece usually are some form of a J-nut or U-nut.[2][3] Contents 1 History 2 See also 3 References 3.1 Notes 3.2 Bibliography History[edit] Albert H. Tinnerman, at the plant opening on Brookpark Road, 1950, presents keys to Mayor Thomas A. Burke, Cleveland and to Mayor John M. Coyne, Brooklyn. The speed nut was invented in 1924 by Albert H. Tinnerman, son of prominent Cleveland stove pioneer and banker, George Tinnerman, who started Tinnerman Steel Range Company and developed and manufactured the first sheet metal kitchen range in 1875. This was a vast improvement over cast iron stoves of that day. In 1923, Albert H. Tinnerman originated the first all-porcelain enameled gas range with concealed fastenings. Tinnerman invented the speed nut to resolve issues with stove shipping. George Tinnerman II, grandson of the founder, commercialized Speed Nuts in markets beyond stoves. So successful in fact that the stove business shut down entirely. He held over 400 fastener patents. Tinnerman became the supplier of fasteners for 100% of WWII aircraft. According to a 1947 Fortune Magazine article, the Tinnerman Company used aggressive techniques to change the automotive industry. The timesaving fasteners held parts in place without the need for welding or riveting. At the time, an automobile manufacturer doubted that it was strong enough to hold fenders to bodies. A.H. Tinnerman responded by hoisting a 3,325-pound Plymouth off the ground supported by a Speed Nut. A.H. also created a plan to save Ford millions of dollars by changing the way automobiles are created – finding 400 unique places and application for Tinnerman products. It became an automotive revolution. [4] Tinnerman Products was formed in 1939, and evolved from the Speed Nut development with manufacturing plants in Cleveland, Ohio. A modern manufacturing plant was constructed on Brookpark Road in the early 1950s. Tinnerman Products later merged with Eaton Yale & Towne in 1969. (Eaton Corporation). In 1999, Eaton sold Tinnerman to TransTechnology for $173 million cash. In 2009, ARaymond purchased Tinnerman for an undisclosed sum. ARaymond Tinnerman has manufacturing facilities in Brunswick, OH; Rochester Hills, Mich.; Flemingsburg, Ky.; Logansport, Ind.; Hamilton, Ontario; and San Luis Potosí, Mexico.

Reign[edit] Joined by Ras Haile Yosadiq and Dejazmach Gebre Masqal, Wolde Gabriel met Ras Ali, the Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I, and their supporters in the Battle of Madab, where the allies were defeated. Dejazmach Wolde Gabriel was killed in battle and Baeda Maryam was captured.[1] However, Atse Baeda Maryam's followers would not surrender, and elevated Tekle Haymanot to replace him. Baeda Maryam is sometimes given the title Atse, a less familiar Amharic word for "Emperor", to distinguish him from the other Emperors of Ethiopia with the same name. Because he was not recognized as a legitimate ruler, he is not assigned a throne name.

It tells the tale of the Mortland girls – beautiful, but cold, Julia; remote and aloof Finn; and young ‘different’ Maisie – who come with their mother, Stella, to live in their grandfather's home, a huge and ancient ruin of an abbey.[1] Plot summary[edit] In the summer of 1967, the family friends Dan, Nick and Lucas arrive for a visit. Dan is Finn's boyfriend; Nick is a young doctor; and Lucas is a non-conformist fame-hungry artist and disregards others. Lucas is painting the girls' portraits. When he works on Maisie, she entertains him with tales of the family's past. However, when Maisie tells of having her fortune told years ago, he scoffs and so she doesn't tell him what she saw in the fortune teller's crystal ball. As the family begins to prepare to travel to Gramps's childhood home for their annual visit, their place is enveloped in a brooding sense of impending doom. Maisie (who wanders at night) spies Finn returning home very early in the morning, naked under her dress. Maisie worries that Dan's heart will be broken if Finn has been with Lucas, as she suspects. Before the family leaves on their trip, Stella and her father work on their plan to ask Gramps's wealthy twin brother for a loan to repair the crumbling Abbey. Maisie slips away, spying Lucas furtively leaving for Cambridge on Julia's bike. She wonders if he has stolen it. Maisie then overhears a passionate argument between Dan and Finn, followed by an equally passionate embrace. The house is filled with fear, distrust and despair. Maisie doesn't know what is wrong with her family but decides she must take action to help them. As usual Gramps's brother rebuffs the family's request for a loan, spurred on by his wife Violet ‘the Viper’. However, Maisie acquires money through surprising means. During this transaction she learns that her family fears she will turn out like her deceased father. She does not understand, what does it mean? The story skips more than twenty years later to 1989, and, rather than being a continuation of Maisie’s tale, it is Dan who is narrating. The sense of impending doom turns to suspenseful mystery as Dan reflects back on a tragedy that occurred during the summer of 1967 involving the Mortland family. Lucas is now a celebrated artist planning to show his 1967 portrait, The Sisters Mortland, at a retrospective. Dan is horrified at the thought of stirring up the family tragedy and sorrow. At this, it is learnt that Maisie was the cause of the tragedy, as she had jumped out of a window. It is also learnt by the reader, that Maisie was possibly autistic, though it is not explained clearly. Dan's life is also something of a tragedy. His job as a producer of commercials ends, his father dies, and he exists in a drug-blurred depression. The current focus of his life is the tragic puzzle of the Mortland event that occurred during that long past summer. Where did it all go wrong? Why did it happen? And how did he lose the love of his life? References[edit] ^ Shannon, Terry Miller (February 28, 2002). "The Sisters Mortland by Sally Beauman". Bookreporter.com. Retrieved 2007-05-27.

The method was introduced by Keith Beven and Andrew Binley in 1992.[1][2] The basic idea of GLUE is that given our inability to represent exactly in a mathematical model how nature works, there will always be several different models that mimic equally well an observed natural process (such as river discharge). Such equally acceptable or behavioral models are therefore called equifinal.[3] The methodology deals with models whose results are expressed as probability distributions of possible outcomes, often in the form of Monte Carlo simulations, and the problem can be viewed as assessing, and comparing between models, how good these representations of uncertainty are. There is an implicit understanding that the models being used are approximations to what might be obtained from a thorough Bayesian analysis of the problem if a fully adequate model of real-world hydrological processes were available.[4][5] [6] [7] GLUE is equivalent to Approximate Bayesian computation for some choices of summary statistic and threshold [8][9] References[edit] ^ Beven, Keith; Binley, Andrew (1992).

They may supply food in the form of fruit, nuts, or leaves that can be used as a vegetable; while at the same time supplying firewood, add nitrogen to the soil, or supply some other combination of multiple outputs. "Multipurpose tree" is a term common to agroforestry, particularly when speaking of tropical agroforestry where the tree owner is a subsistence farmer. While all trees can be said to serve several purposes, such as providing habitat, shade, or soil improvement; multipurpose trees have a greater impact on a farmer's well-being because they fulfill more than one basic human need. In most cases multipurpose trees have a primary role; such as being part of a living fence, or a windbreak, or used in an ally cropping system. In addition to this they will have one or more secondary roles, most often supplying a family with food or firewood, or both. When a multipurpose tree is planted, a number of needs and functions can be fulfilled at once. They may be used as a windbreak, while also supplying a staple food for the owner. They may be used as fencepost in a living fence, while also being the main source of firewood for the owner. They may be intercropped into existing fields, to supply nitrogen to the soil, and at the same time serve as a source of both food and firewood. Common multipurpose trees of the tropics include: Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) – the most common tree used for living fences in Central America, firewood, fodder, fixing nitrogen into the soil. Moringa (Moringa oleifera) – edible leaves, pods and beans, commonly used for animal forage and shade (it does not fix nitrogen as is commonly believed[1]) Coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) – used for food, purified water (juice from inside the coconut), roof thatching, firewood, shade. Neem (Azadirachta indica) – limited use as insect repellent, antibiotic, adding nitrogen to the soil, windbreaks, biomass production for use as mulch, firewood. Ideally most trees found on tropical farms should be multipurpose, and provide more to the farmer than simply shade and firewood. In most cases they should be nitrogen fixing legumes, or trees that greatly increase the farmer's food security. See also[edit] Trees portal OneTree References[edit] ^ "Does Moringa fix nitrogen?".

The main structure is a stone ringfort, thought to have been built by the Northern Uí Néill, in the sixth or seventh century CE;[1] although there is evidence that the site had been in use before the fort was built. It has been identified as the seat of the Kingdom of Ailech and one of the royal sites of Gaelic Ireland. The wall is about 4.5 metres (15 ft) thick and 5 metres (16 ft) high. Inside it has three terraces, which are linked by steps, and two long passages within it. Originally, there would have been buildings inside the ringfort. Just outside it are the remains of a well and a tumulus. By the 12th century, the Kingdom of Ailech had become embattled and lost a fair amount of territory to the invading Normans. According to Irish literature, the ringfort was mostly destroyed by Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster, in 1101. Substantial restoration work was carried out in 1870. Today, the site is an Irish National Monument and a tourist attraction.

Although the hill is comparatively not that high, the summit dominates the neighbouring counties of Londonderry, Donegal and Tyrone. Located at the edge of the Inishowen peninsula, it is 11.25 kilometres (7 mi) northwest of the ecclesiastical site of Derry. The histories of the sites are closely linked. There is much legend and historical material related to the Grianán of Aileach. The Irish annals record its destruction in 1101. The main monument on the hill is a stone cashel, restored in the nineteenth century, but probably built in the eighth century CE. The summit's use as an area of settlement may go back much further. A tumulus at the Grianán may date back to the Neolithic age. A covered well was found near the cashel in the early nineteenth century. Interior view of Grianan of Aileach View from Grianan of Aileach George Petrie first surveyed the Grianán of Aileach in the 1830s. At this time the cashel was nothing more than a mere ruin. He gives a description of the hill and the monument. The eastern ascent of the hill is described as gradual but within 30 metres (98 ft) of the top, it terminated in a circular apex. An ancient road between two ledges of natural rock led to the summit. The cashel was surrounded by three concentric ramparts. Petrie suggests that, in the fashion of other monuments of this type such as Emania, the whole hill may have been enclosed by many other ramparts. There is no physical or historical evidence for this. The ramparts that remained were made of earth and stone and follow the natural form of the hill with an irregular circular pattern. They ascend above each other creating levelled terraces. The circular apex of the hill within the outermost enclosure contains about 2.2 hectares (5.4 acres), within the second about 1.6 hectares (4.0 acres) and within the third about 4 hectares (9.9 acres). Currently, the innermost bank is very low, worn and heather-covered but traceable for almost its entire circuit. The other two banks are in a similar state but are untraceable for long sections. Between the inner most rampart and the cashel, the road dwindles in its width and curves slightly to the right. This "path" was strengthened on either side by walls. At the time of the survey only the foundation stones of these walls remained. Petrie's plan of the site shows a line of stones leading up to the entrance. These are now gone. The ruins of the cashel itself are described as being a circular wall enclosing an area of 23.6 metres (77 ft) in diameter. The wall had a height of 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) with a breadth varying from 4.6 metres (15 ft) to 3.5 metres (11 ft). While not perpendicular, it had an inclination inwards indicating its similarity to most other Irish stone forts. Petrie suggests that it was probably originally between twice and four times as high as it was when he surveyed it. 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) up on the interior side of the wall, the thickness was 0.76 metres (2 ft 6 in) due to the presence of terracing. The terrace is reached by flights of steps on either side of the entrance gateway. Fallen stones had covered any other existing stairs. Petrie suggests that there were originally three or four such terraces ascending to the top of the wall. On each side of the entranceway, there are "galleries" within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. Near the north end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone. Grianan Ailligh wall stones of mica schist. The official re-opening of Grianan Aileach in 1878 following the reconstruction of Dr. Walter Bernard. The current hillfort, after the restoration of 1874–1878, is substantially different but much of the old structure remains intact. During the restoration, it was found that parts of the original drystone masonry had been preserved under the collapse. The workers marked, in tar, the undisturbed portions of the cashel and used the collapsed stone to build on this foundation. They supplemented these with other stones from the area to replace those 'removed by King Murdoch O'Brien in 1101'. The internal diameters of the cashel are 23.6 metres north to south and 23.2 metres (76 ft) east to west. The lintel-covered entrance is 4.65 metres (15.3 ft) long, 1.12 metres (3 ft 8 in) wide and 1.86 metres (6 ft 1 in) metres high. Before the restoration, the gateway's lintel was not in place. It was1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) wide and 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) high. It leads into the fort from the east. Slight recesses on either side of the entrance way have been filled in. They were probably to allow double leaves of an original doorway to fold flush against the wall. The interior rises in three terraces accessible by stairways which are previously mentioned. The outer wall is a dry-stone construction. On each side of the entranceway, there are "galleries" within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. The south wall passage entrance is 45 centimetres (18 in) wide, 69 centimetres (27 in) high and 1.4 metres (4 ft 7 in) long. It turns through a right angle where it becomes 50 centimetres (20 in) wide,85 centimetres (33 in) high and 20.4 metres (67 ft) long. Near the north end there is a recess on the west side 50 centimetres (20 in) wide, 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) and 75 centimetres (30 in) deep. The northeast gallery entrance is 65 centimetres (26 in) wide, 97 centimetres (38 in) high and 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 in) long. It meets the main part of the passage in a T-junction. To the north, the passage is70 centimetres (28 in) wide, 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) high and 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) long. To the south, the passage is 60 centimetres (24 in) wide, 1.4 metres (4 ft 7 in) high and 8.6 metres (28 ft) long. Near the north of end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone. The interior of the cashel is fairly level but Petrie recorded the remains of a small oblong church measuring 5 metres (16 ft) by 4.3 metres (14 ft). The walls were 61 centimetres (24 in) thick and not more than 62 centimetres (24 in) high. The structure was constructed of mortar but nothing remains of it today. A drain runs through the cashel wall at ground level on the northwest side. It leads from a midden in the western side of the enclosure that was 1.7 metres (5 ft 7 in) in diameter and one foot deep. St. Patrick's Well south of the Grianán of Aileach. There are many clues that the Grianán of Aileach is a multi-period site. Brian Lacy suggests that the earthen banks surrounding the fort probably represent the defences of a hillfort of the late Bronze Age or Iron Age. Between the two outer banks on the south side of the hill, is the formerly covered spring well which is dedicated to St. Patrick. Petrie describes the tumulus, between the second and third wall, as being a small mound surrounded by a circle of ten stones. These stones were laid horizontally and converged towards the centre. In Petrie's time, the mound had been excavated but nothing to explain its meaning was discovered. It was subsequently destroyed but its former position is marked by a heap of broken stones. During the excavation work of the 1870s, Bernard documented the discovery of many artefacts. Behind a niche in the doorway, a large stone 40 centimetres (16 in) wide was found. It had a round hole in the centre, 7.6 centimetres (3 in) deep and 3.8 centimetres (1.5 in) in diameter. A rotten piece of wood was found in the hole. Bernard was unable to decipher its use suggesting only that it could have been a sundial. Bernard discovered many animal bones including sheep, cattle, goats and birds. He found stone items including "sling-stones", "warrior's clubs" and a "sugar-loaf-shaped stone with a well-cut base" 25 centimetres (10 in) long, 38 centimetres (15 in) round base, 36 centimetres (14 in) round centre and 25 centimetres (10 in) round top. The most interesting stone object was "a slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares", which Lacy believed to be some kind of gaming board. Among the miscellaneous items found were a plough socket, an iron ring, some coins and a bead. Morphology[edit] The Grianán of Aileach, at its broadest description, is a ringfort. More precisely it is a multivallate cashel hillfort. A Grianan fort at sunset from above A ring fort can be described as a space, usually circular, surrounded by a bank and ditch or simply a rampart of stone. The bank is generally built by piling up inside the fosse the material obtained digging the latter. Ringforts vary considerably in size and style. In more elaborately defended examples, such as Aileach, the defences take up a much greater area than the enclosure itself. Matthew Stout gives many examples of why the people who built these structures chose a circular formation. First of all, they had strategic advantages. Circular sites allowed for a broad perspective of the surrounding area and allowed the maximum area to be enclosed relative to the bank constructed. He also comes up with some much more metaphysical theories. He suggests that a circular formation linked the site and its occupants with the circular burial mounds of their ancestors. About a third of all Irish hillforts have mounds or cairns within them. The Aileach is no exception. He also puts forward the idea that a circular form was favoured because corners could act as a dwelling-place of evil spirits. He bases these claims on ethnographic comparisons.[vague][citation needed] Ringforts housed families of varying degrees of wealth, so that some of them are more impressive than others. Ringforts do not normally occupy dominant or commanding positions. The only exception to this are the ringforts built in areas of bad drainage where high places are the only suitable spots for habitation. Raftery names three monuments which he finds hard to categorise as being either a ringfort or a hillfort: Cahirciveen; Carraig Aille; and Lough Gur. While the places where they sit are areas of natural defence, they may have been built there for drainage purposes. The buildings themselves are not militaristic or defensive in themselves. They were probably family homesteads. The defining characteristic of hillforts is an inbuilt defensive nature. Therefore, hillforts as a subcategory of the ringfort are defined by their location and style of construction. Hillfort consist of ‘large hilltop areas on which the summit is enclosed by one (univallate) or multiple ramparts (multivallate) of earth or stone’. A good example would be Dún Aengus on Inishmore. Its defensive nature is explicit due to the system of stone slabs, known as chevaux de frise, planted into the ground outside the fort structure itself. The Grianán of Aileach, as described in the introductory section, is encircled by three enclosures and is therefore trivallate. The actual living space of ringforts often forms less than 60% of the total monument area. Contemporary law tracts described a king's principal dwelling to have been a univallate ringfort. Increasing a site's defences without a corresponding increase in its functional area demonstrates either a greater need for defence or a display of status. Therefore, a ring fort with two ramparts (bivallate) acts a status symbol. The rarity of trivallate hillforts, such as that at the Grianán, shows the importance and status of its occupants rather a need for defence. Stout gives several examples to indicate their symbolic importance simply due to their impracticality as defensive structures. In general, they were little more than fences to prevent stock from straying and to protect against wild animals. As siege tools, they were useless. If anything they were built to repel cattle raids.This might not be the case with the Grianán of Aileach While the original structure for which the ramparts were built does not exist any more, the cashel of Aileach, while formidable, was probably designed with less of a defensive function in mind but rather it was built as a symbol of royal power. Stone structures appear both eternal and immovable. The cashel was built on this site for the panoramic view rather than for defence. This could be seen as changing the visual emphasis of the ramparts from being defensive terraces to enclosures of royal power and influence. Hillforts are known throughout western Europe but Irish hillforts were not as well developed and never attained the standard of the so-called Celtic Oppida of Continental Europe and Britain. They vary in size but are of a communal rather than single-family residence. Cashels (stone-built ringforts) tend to be much smaller than earthen examples. The average earthen ringfort has an internal diameter of 22 metres in south Donegal; cashels in the same area have an average internal diameter of 20 metres. The Grianán of Aileach, with an average internal diameter of 23.4 metres is larger than the latter and therefore this must be an indication of the wealth and importance of its inhabitants and perhaps it is also an indication of the size of its occupant population. Lacy suggests that the innovative nature of the stone fort of Aileach must have been an unusual site when it was first constructed. The names Garvan, Frigru/ Rigriu are found in many Irish authorities to be the names of the builders of Aileach. These characters are linked to the Formorians and therefore may be nothing more than mythological creations. Lacy believes that the builder may have been Áed Oirdnide, the victor at the battle of Cloíteach. Chronology[edit] Grianan of Aileach fort sits on a hilltop in the Inishowen peninsula It is widely accepted that most ringforts date from the Early Christian period. Finds from ringforts typically include items which date from the second half of the first millennium: a hand-made, bucket shaped pottery style called 'Souterrain Ware', which uses local clays and can be decorated or undecorated; glass beads; bone, bronze and iron pins; and artefacts of bone and metalwork. The artefacts, which Dr. Bernard found during his excavation of the cashel interior, seem to correspond to the above list of typical items. Indeed, in a recent publication, Brian Lacy comes up with an exact date for its construction which corresponds with this period. He argues that Aileach is the name of a specific site in antiquity and also the name of the Cenél nEógain 'homeland' kingdom of Inis Eogian, derived from the place now known as Elaghmore (Aileach Mór) in County Londonderry. After the decisive battle of Cloítech in 789, when the Cenél nEógain won total control of the over-kingdom of the northern Uí Néill, the successful kings relocated to the Grianán, building it inside the pre-existing prehistoric hillfort as a visual symbol of their new mastery of all the landscape visible from that commanding view. Stout comes to the conclusion that the majority of Ireland's ringforts were occupied and constructed during a three hundred-year period from the beginning of the seventh century to the end of the ninth century AD. Lacy concludes that Aileach was inhabited by the northern Ui Néill dynasty from 789 to about 1050. This was a period when many of the local kings in Ireland were moving to the towns founded by the Vikings or into more important ecclesiastical sites which by this time seemed to have been functioning as towns following the Vikings' model. Distribution[edit] Based on the morphology of hillforts, Raftery estimates that there are forty hillforts in Ireland. However, Lacy suggests that there are fifty forts remaining in Ireland. Multivallate hillforts are suggested to be confined to the West and South of the country; univallate forts are to be found in the north and east. The Grianán of Aileach is seen as an exception to this pattern. Raftery suggests that this simple division of distribution might be more blurred after further hillfort study and discovery. The distribution of ringforts, in general, is much wider although we are a long way from knowing the exact number which still survive. Ringfort distribution is not even. Areas of low ringfort density correspond to intensely tilled, highly-Normanised areas. The assumption is that during the last eight centuries of tilling, many ringfort sites were destroyed. On this basis, Stout states that there are 45,119 ringforts in Ireland of which 41% have been positively identified as of March 1995. The mean density for Ireland as a whole is 0.55 per square kilometre. The density goes from below 0.20 per square kilometre in Donegal, Kildare and Dublin to above 1.0 per square kilometre in Roscommon, Limerick and Sligo. The regions of highest density are north Munster, east Connaught/ northwest Leinster and east Ulster. Areas of low density are in northwest Ulster and most of Leinster. As one can see, Donegal is an area of low ringfort concentration. It is therefore odd to find a hillfort of the size and scope of Aileach in this area. The ringfort density of Northwest Ulster as a whole is 0.16 per square kilometre. Northwest Ulster includes all of Donegal and the western portions of Londonderry and Tyrone. Ringforts are virtually absent from the areas of Derryveagh, the Blue Stacks, Slieve League and Inishowen. Ringforts are rarely found in similarly elevated areas of Londonderry and Tyrone, including the Sperrin Mountains and west of the Roe River. Due to the inhospitable nature of these areas due to blanket bogs and thin rock, they were sparsely populated. There were pockets of settlement such as southwest Donegal. Ringsforts can be found along the eastern slopes of Derryveagh Mountains, the Roe River valley and the Mourne River basin. Although some Early Christian settlement is present, the areas as a whole was relatively sparsely settled with ringforts despite the Mourne and Foyle river valleys being extremely suitable for agricultural exploitation. Other forms of secular settlement are also thinly distributed in the area although several souterrains have been found. Northwest Ulster maintained a low population density throughout the Early Christian Era. Barrett examined ringforts in southern Donegal. She identified 124 ringforts in an area reaching from Glen Head to Lough Ekse and south along the county boundary to Bundoran. Thirty-two of the ringforts were cashels and 15% were bivallate sites. Ringfort builders avoided land below 30 metres preferring land between 30 and 60 metres. Soil quality was statistically proven to be a key determinant of settlement density. Brown earth and grey-brown podzolic soils were particularly favoured explaining the concentration of sites west of Donegal Bay. The brown earth soils and the podzolic soils of St. John's peninsula also attracted a high proportion of sites. The distribution of ecclesiastical sites corresponds broadly with that of ringforts. Function[edit] Theories accounting for the function of hillforts range from their use as defensive sites to ceremonial enclosures. The Grianán of Aileach could possibly have served both of these purposes and served even more functions. A number of writers in the nineteenth century suggested that one of the two sites marked as Regia (or royal place) on Ptolemy's map of Ireland, may be identified with the Grianán. The site itself is ancient. Some early texts refer to Aileach as metaphorically being the oldest building in Ireland. Perhaps the best way to discover the function of this hillfort is to break down its name. The site of the Grianán of Aileach has been known by many names over its long history: Aileach; Aileach Neid; Aileach Frigrinn, Aileach Imchell; Grianán Ailigh and Aileach of the Kings. The word Aileach has a long history and is found both in Ireland and Scotland. Both Petrie and Lacy suggest that it comes from an adjective derived from old Irish "Ail", which means a rock, stone or boulder. Lacy conduces that Aileach, therefore, means either stony or stone place. Petrie goes further by saying it means stone house or habitation. In the same vein, Lacy suggests the etymology of the word might derive from "Ali Theach" meaning stone house. However, Lacy's primary translation seems more plausible due to the name Aileach originally coming from Aileach Mór which is mentioned in the chronology section. The name may have come from the rocky nature of the area or possibly acts as a description of the stone cashel itself. The word Grianán means sunny place. It was appropriated by the early Irish to mean a place with a view. This is probably the sense in which the word was used to describe the Grianán under discussion. An earlier theory was that the word meant "temple of the sun". This theory has not been substantiated. There is much evidence that the word was constantly used in a figurative sense to signify a distinguished residence or palace. Perhaps, if interpreted in this sense it may mean that if one is in the presence of a king, one will always be in a sunny place. The best summary one can contrive from the etymological breakdown of the name is that it means "The Stone Palace of the Sunny View". In the historic period, from the middle of the sixth century, the Grianán of Aileach is always thought of as the capital of the northern Ui Neill, the dynasty descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages. It acted as such up until the twelfth century. However, as it was destroyed in 1050, it was the capital in name only. It was the site where the Kings of Aileach held their inauguration ceremonies. It is written in the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick that Patrick blessed the fortress and left a symbolic flagstone there prophesying that many kings and clerics would come from the place. This flagstone can no longer be found at the fortress. It is believed that a preserved flagstone at Belmont House School in Derry, called St. Columb's Stone, is the inauguration stone. On one side of the stone, which is 2 metres square, are carved two feet marks. However, there is no substantiating evidence to back this up. We can see from this evidence that Grianán of Aileach was an extremely important site. It was the secular centre of Northwest Donegal while the ecclesiastical settlement at Derry was the religious centre. Together, they acted as the political hub of the region. Aileach's political and strategic importance was such that the annals report that it was attacked at least three times during its existence. In 674, Fínsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort. Perhaps, this was the earlier hillfort that stood on the site before the cashel was built. In 937, during the reign of Muirchertach mac Néill, Viking raiders demolished the site. Vikings had settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle during this period. In 1006, Brian Boru, marched through the territory of the Cenel Conail and the Cenel Eogain and probably came to Aileach. In 1101, another king of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briain, came to Inishowen where he proceeded to plunder and ravage the region. He destroyed the Grianán of Aileach in revenge for the destruction and demolition of Kincora by Domnall Ua Lochlainn in 1088. While the main function of this particular hillfort was that of a royal capital, ringforts in general in Ireland functioned as a native version of the common European settlement pattern known as einzelhöfe: dispersed individual farmsteads. However, hillforts are of communal rather than single-family importance. It is possible that some ringforts functioned throughout their existence only as cattle enclosures, or with no domestic function. It is unlikely that Aileach was used in such a fashion during or after it ceased to function as a royal fort. The entrance is too low and narrow for cattle to move through. This narrowness of the entrance may be for defensive purposes. The only building foundation in the fort, besides the walls, was that of the penal church. Bernard mentions no other foundations. He does mention the finding of some fluted columns which may indicate that there was a stone structure within the fort walls. There is no evidence for any house-like structures though. Circular houses, which are directly associated with the main phase of ringfort occupation, tended to be located towards the centre of the enclosure placing them furthest from an outside attack. If such a house stood in the fort, any trace of it would have been destroyed while the church was being built. Assessment of monument[edit] Royal ringforts would have been surrounded by ringforts of a lower status. This makes the Grianán of Aileach an interesting example as no writer has yet mentioned the presence of subordinate ringforts. It would appear that either further archaeological excavation is required to find them or perhaps the Grianán is unique in that it may stand alone. As a hillfort, with its more defensive nature, its large size and the surrounding barren landscape, it probably did stand alone. Raftery suggests that perhaps some hillforts were used as places of last refuge. However, this could not have possibly been the case with Aileach. Without reading the histories of the site, the physical presence of the three ramparts confirms that whoever the occupant, their status was quite, if not uniquely, high. The ramparts are meant to be seen rather than used. Based on the written histories we know that this was the seat of the Ui Neill. Based on the archaeological evidence which indicates that there were large quantities of animal meat consumed and that games were played (the chequered board mentioned above), this hillfort seems to be a place of festival and, if the annals are to be believed, a place of inaugurational ceremony. The presence of the tumulus suggests an ancient basis to this settlement, perhaps even religious in some way. The cold winds (especially during winter) and the high altitude would be uncomfortable for continual residence. In the section on distribution, we saw that ringforts in Northwest Ulster were extremely rare. If this was the case during the period, the cashel of Aileach would have been quite a sight to behold for the local population and the fact that a ringfort of its magnitude was even built shows the importance of its occupants. Its relative proximity to Derry shows a conscious attempt to remain connected to that ecclesiastical site. The Grianán of Aileach probably served the same purpose as Tara. It was a place of festival and ritual inauguration. It seems that by linking St. Patrick into the institution of Aileach, converts were attempting to consolidate it as a site of Christian inauguration while acknowledging their pagan past. The naming of the holy well after Patrick can be seen as a symbol of continuity of settlement rather than usurpation. In mythology[edit] In Irish mythology and folklore, the ringfort is said to have been originally built by the Dagda, a god and the celebrated king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who planned and fought the battle of the second or northern Magh Tuireadh, against the Fomorians. The fort was erected around the grave of his son Aedh who had been killed through jealousy by Corrgenn, a Connacht chieftain. The history of the death of Aedh, and the building of Aileach, is given at length in a poem preserved in the Book of Lecan which has been printed with an English translation (verse 38 Ordnance Memoir of the parish of Templemore, Dr Perie). The verses regarding the building of this rath follow: "Then were brought the two good men In art experts, "Garbhan and Imcheall", to Eochaid [Daghda], The fair-haired, vindictive; he ordered these a rath to build, Aileach." Around the gentle youth: That it should be a rath of splendid sections— The finest in Erinn. Neid, son of Indai, said to them, [He] of the severe mind, That the best hosts in the world could not erect A building like Aileach. Garbhan the active proceeded to dress And to cut [the stones]; Imcheall proceeded to set them All around in the house. The building of Aileach's fastness came to an end, Though it was a laborious process; The top of the house of the groaning hostages "One stone closed". In a subsequent verse of this poem (verse 54), the author says that Aileach is the senior or father of all the buildings in Erinn. It also states that in later times it was called Aileach Frigrind. According to another poem written by Flann of Monasterboice and preserved in the Book of Leinster, Frigrind was a famous builder who claimed the protection of the monarch Fiacha Sraibhthine who was slain in the battle of Dubh Chomar, in Meath, a.d. 322;[2] the monarch gave him the ancient fort of Aileach for his dwelling-place. Here Frigrind built a splendid house of wood for his wife from red yew, carved and emblazoned with gold and bronze; thick set it with shining gems.[2] It appears clearly from this very ancient poem that not only was the outer Rath, or protective circle, of Aileach built of stone by the two masons Imcheall and Garbhan, but the palace and other houses within the enclosure were also built of stone (nay, even of chipped and cut stone). According to the chronology of the Annals of the Four Masters, Aileach was built seventeen hundred years before the Christian era. Also worth noticing is the fact that Aileach is one of the few spots in Ireland that is marked in its proper place by the geographer Ptolemy of Alexandria, who some say lived in the second century, nearly two hundred years before the time of Frigrind. Ptolemy distinguishes the Rath as a royal residence.[2] Site today[edit] View of entrance of Grianan of Aileach 2007 The town of Burt is the nearest community and the fortress stands mainly intact insofar as its main walls and features are concerned. Portions of the fortress were destroyed over time but much was rebuilt in the nineteenth century with a view towards retaining the historic nature and aesthetics of the fortress. Dr. Bernard is recorded as having directed the restoration work. The site is now owned by the Irish government. More restoration work has taken place since 2001 by the Office of Public Works due to a wall collapse and is the subject of public controversy. If any dimensional change in the building's architecture has occurred, nothing about it has been published yet. There are some visible signs of its restoration. Large sections of the wall have been replaced. These sections are easily visually differentiated from the original wall by their shape and colour. Some of the upper parts of the wall have been cemented, probably to prevent falling stones. An iron gate has been set into the entrance. In 2007, the entrance corridor was supported by iron girders which have since been removed. In popular culture[edit] The filmmaker Gerard Lough used the fort as a location for his 2015 film Night People by filming a sequence there over the course of a two-day period at Blue hour.[3] Armand Gatti filmed a scene at the fort in his 1983 film Nous étions tous des noms d'arbres ("And our names were names of trees").[4] Bibliography[edit] Walter, Bernard (1879), "Exploration and Restoration of the Ruin of the Grianan of Aileach", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, 2nd, 1.

For the Streltsy commander executed in 1682, see Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky (Tararui). Prince Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky (Russian: Иван Андреевич Хованский) (died 1621) was a Russian boyar, Voyevoda of Novgorod, and Namestnik of Ryazan. During the Time of Troubles, he participated in the struggle against the supporters of False Dmitry II and Polish invaders. In 1607, Khovansky was sent to Mikhailov, which had been occupied by the opponents of Vasili IV of Russia, but his attacks on this city were rebuffed. In 1608, he and Prokopy Lyapunov fought against the Polish army in the Ryazan region, but was defeated by Aleksander Józef Lisowski at Zaraysk. In 1610, Khovansky fought alongside Prince Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, who ordered him to combine forces with the Swedish army, occupy the southern part of the Tver region, and prevent the enemy from regrouping. Khovansky managed to rendezvous with the Swedes near Staritsa, capture Rzhev, and beset Bely. Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski was dispatched to aid the Polish army, but Khovansky avoided the collision and moved towards Mozhaysk in order to combine forces with Dmitry Shuisky. Khovansky took part in the Battle of Klushino, where Shuisky suffered a severe defeat from Hetman Żółkiewski. When Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin organized a volunteer army to save Moscow from the Polish invaders, Khovansky took part in this army’s campaign against the enemy. Together with Minin, he commanded this army during its march from Yaroslavl to Rostov, while Pozharsky was in Suzdal. In 1613−1614, Khovansky was appointed Voyevoda in Yaroslavl. In Spring 1615, he was granted the title of boyar and sent to the outskirts of Smolensk to command the inactive Russian army. Khovansky did not take part in military action due to the beginning of peace talks. When the negotiations were interrupted, Khovansky was put in charge of a unit (approx. 5,000 men), which had been fighting the Lithuanians in the Siversk region. In 1616–1617, he was appointed head of the Judicial Prikaz in Vladimir and then Voyevoda of Novgorod (from June 1617 to 1619).

The new theater was built in 2004 near Turkmen National Conservatory.[4] Building[edit] The theater was built by the Turkish company Polimeks in a classic style, it features a dome and white marble columns on the facade. The project cost US$17 million.[5] The theater hall was designed as a multi-purpose hall with 576 seats, on the ground floor and 224 on the balconies, with a total audience of 800 people.[6] The stage is on a rotating platform with a diameter of 9 meters on average and an orchestral pit of 55 square meters, which has a lifting organization system.

It first aired on 3 September 2016. Plot[edit] Kirk and Spock are traveling to the Starbase at Corinth IV for a classified briefing, while Sulu and McKennah take some leisure time, Sulu to visit a museum, McKennah to chase up the social changes in Orion society following the Enterprise's incident with Zaminhon and the slave girl Lolani. At the starbase, Kirk and Spock are greeted by Commodore Laura Gray, who informs them that the crew of the Hood has been lost due to life support systems failure. The Enterprise has been sent to tow the Hood home and due to several losses across the quadrant, when the Hood starts out again, it will need experienced officers assigned to it. She formally offers Spock a promotion to Captain. Meanwhile, with Scott in command, the Enterprise is investigating what happened to the Hood, science officer Follet suggests it may be connected to the subspace anomaly they were investigating. Back at Corinth IV, Gray informs Kirk and Spock of a complication. Commander Diana Garrett, 1st officer of Earth's Space Dock, had applied for the Captaincy of the Hood but was turned down, she has now launched a formal appeal, stating she has been overlooked because she's a woman. Kirk and Spock are shocked at such an assertion in the 23rd century. Gray states that Tellarite diplomacy may be a factor, as 100 years ago the Federation was formed due to an alliance of Humans, Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites united against the Romulan incursion, Tellar Prime's resources played an important factor in the Federation's victory. Tellarite society frowns on females being starship captains especially constitution class starships, which are top of the line, despite Starfleet have plenty of female captains in its history. However, although Starfleet and the Federation are not bound by Tellarite views, since the controversial admission of Coridan to the Federation, the Tellarites have indicated they may leave the Federation, robbing it of a vital resource and ally. Gray asks Kirk to interview Garrett and decide if she is a suitable candidate. Both Kirk and Spock are troubled by the notion that Starfleet may be engaging in undue bias against women, but also are both conflicted by the fact that Spock would have to leave the Enterprise. On the Enterprise, all other systems on the Hood appear to be normal, nor is there any sign of the anomaly they were investigating. Scotty decides to learn more about what happened before they tow the ship home. Spock confers with Dr. McKennah, regarding Garrett and what she is claiming. McKennah believes the Tellarite threats are not to be taken seriously, but there might be another issue at work. She states that how people evaluate others is a many-layered process and that if bias does exist, it is often subconscious. Spock, who knows what it's like to be treated differently agrees, however, he notes that there are incidents in Garrett's service record that warrant scrutiny, and this may be why she is being overlooked rather than her sex. McKennah asks Spock if Garrett would be under the same amount of scrutiny if she was male and Spock believes so although he cannot be sure if everyone else would concur. Garrett arrives at Corinth IV with Vice Admiral Stomm, Kirk interviews her briefly and is impressed with her record, however when he questions her about an incident she was involved in at Nimbus III where her captain was killed, Garrett refuses to discuss the incident and becomes defensive, she then calls a halt to the interview and leaves, leaving Kirk dumbfounded. Later on, Gray informs Kirk that Garrett has now demanded a formal hearing to determine the Captaincy of the Hood, the board will be presided by Gray, Stomm, and Kirk. On the Enterprise, Ensign Chekov attempts to provide power to the Hood's engine room, long enough for several hours of life support to better determine what happened. However, he is disappointed when Uhura and Follet are selected to go on the away team and he is not. Uhura has noticed he feels overlooked and points out that while he has many skills, he is not focused and should prioritize which department will best suit his talent. Back on Corinth IV, the hearing begins with Gray presiding. The Vulcan admiral Stomm questions Spock regarding his youth and whether his emotions and his Human heritage played a part in his career choices, referring to when he turned down admission to the Vulcan Science Academy. Kirk objects as Spock racial heritage should not have a bearing on his career outcome, Stomm counters by saying that the skills and abilities of all individuals are products of their race, religion, and even sex. Kirk, to quash any doubts of his favoring of Spock states that while it is definitely time for a woman to command a frontline Constitution class starship, but is not sure if Garrett is the right woman to do so. When Garrett takes the stand, it is noted that she has a lot more qualifications and been decorated more times by Starfleet than Spock, on paper she would make an ideal captain, however, Gray brings up the Nimbus III incident, which concerns her. The official investigation into the incident suggested human error, Garrett disputes that by saying the report was conducted by a Tellarite, who may have had a bias against her and she protested the findings and it was determined that she was cleared of any wrongdoing. Gray also notes that Garrett and her other officers plead the seventh guarantee during the inquiry, where they refused to answer the questions presented to them to avoid self-recrimination. Once again Garrett denies any wrongdoing as by law, pleading the seventh cannot be used to imply guilt. Gray states that she is concerned that there are other similar incidents in Garrett's record and it seems that Garrett reacts with hostility whenever her judgment is questioned as part of being a Captain is being able to admit when one was wrong and take responsibility. Garrett states that she reacts with hostility because of the undue scrutiny she believes she receives as a woman and is once again adamant that she was not in the wrong. In the Hood's engine room, Uhura, Scott, Follet, and Drake can find no evidence on an anomaly that could have caused the system failure which killed the crew. Suddenly out of nowhere, the Hood's engines activate and begin to overload, and their shield comes online, meaning the Enterprise cannot beam them out. The ship will explode in minutes. Scott orders Lt. Hadley to clear away before the Hood explodes, but Chekov believes he can transmit a duotronic algorithm to the Hood, which would deactivate its shields, Scott protests claiming it's too dangerous. Hadley allows Chekov to proceed, the circuits overload, and Chekov collapses, but it works and the Enterprise is able to beam the away team home just before the Hood explodes. On Corinth, Stomm endorses Garrett for Captaincy, Gray endorses Spock, however before Kirk can vote, Gray is informed that the Hood has been destroyed, rendering the proceeding useless. Before it ends, Garrett declares that even though the Hood has been destroyed, the issue still remains that female officers are being overlooked for Captaincy and while it may not be intentional it still exists and it is time something was done about it. Starfleet has the opportunity to implement change, although Garrett maybe not be a Captain this time, there are still plenty of women who could be. Everyone agrees. On the Enterprise, Chekov is recovering and Scott is admonishing him for his foolish actions, Chekov agrees but is confused when Scott refers to him as Lieutenant. Scott has informed an admiral of his bravery and original thinking which has earned him a promotion. Despite the happiness, Scott is still worried about the mystery surrounding the Hood. Uhura thanks Chekov for saving them. Kirk meanwhile is speaking with the Tellarite ambassador, who states that he is aware the biased view his people have of women is not in keeping with Federation values or modern standards and that he is part of a movement trying to make changes and tells Kirk when the time comes for a female captain, Starfleet will have his support. Kirk appreciates the Tellar Prime is embracing the winds of change. In the final scene, Kirk and Spock meet with Garrett one last time. Garrett and Kirk part ways having developed a mutual respect for each other, Garrett hopes that one day a Garrett will command an Enterprise, and Kirk states that anything is possible. When Garrett leaves, both Spock and Kirk agree that despite sadness for the loss of the Hood, both are also somewhat glad as it means they will not have to separate. And with that, they head back to the Enterprise. Trivia[edit] Garrett hopes that someday a Garrett will command an Enterprise, nearly 80 years later Rachel Garrett is in command of the Enterprise C, as seen in The Next Generation episode "Yesterday's Enterprise". This episode connects to the rebooted Star Trek movies, where despite the change in reality, Spock still turns down a place at the Vulcan Science Academy, being the first person to do so and it is subtly implied he did it out of spite after the admissions council were disrespectful to Spock's Human mother. The episode also addresses some inconsistencies regarding female Captains in the series. In the Original Series, it is implied in "Turnabout Intruder" by Janice Lester that women cannot be Starship captains, which obviously would be discriminatory and not keeping with the Federation's values of equality. However, the line could have also been interpreted in other ways; for example, Lester was mentally unstable and possibly was not able to be a Captain because of these issues. Lester was also bitter about her failed relationship with Kirk and may have also been stating as a Captain, Kirk wouldn't let her, a woman, get close. Later in the episode Kirk, while trapped in Lester's body, stated that Lester craved power but her own issues prevented her career from progressing and why their relationship failed. Gene Roddenberry at the time stated the line was purely sexist, but Kirk correctly states that from Starfleet's inception there have been female captains, most probably referring to Erika Hernandez, who was in command of the second NX class starship. Also of note: in the opening scene of the episode, Sulu mentions that his great(x6) grandfather grew up in an internment camp during WWII. This is no doubt an homage to George Takei, the first actor to portray Sulu during the Original Series run. Takei, in fact, grew up in an internment camp during WWII. This episode serves as the start of a story arc regarding the mystery of what happened aboard the USS Hood, which is resolved in the series finale.

Started February 2, 1992, by Tim Casey, Chris Chisolm, and Mark Okada, working out of the University of New Mexico, and until April 5, 1993, continued at the University of California, Berkeley, and UC San Francisco (with an additional server at The Pasteur Institute, France), it was the first server of its kind.[2][3][4] After its initial inception some of its members helped to improve the server by writing software with a graphical interface; and thus IGS was born.[5] Pandanet hosts up to 3,000 players at a time, depending on the time of day.[citation needed] Its PC client's name is GoPanda. Contents 1 History 2 Other activities 3 See also 4 Notes 5 External links History[edit] IGS was first opened to the public in February 1992. The first server was located at the University of New Mexico. Within the first year, two more servers were deployed, one at the University of California at Berkeley and one at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France. Leaving the UC servers in 1993, it continued at the University of Pennsylvania for a year until being bought by the Korean ISP nuri.net in 1994. In 1995, the Japanese company NKB Inc., a partner of nuri.net, acquired IGS, and created the division "Pandanet" in 1996, which has managed IGS since. The first professional player to sign-on to IGS was Jiang Zhujiu -9 dan-, on April 24, 1992, which started the trend of high level dan player membership that continues to this very day. Through the months of July and August of that year the first professional tournament was hosted, with over 300 games played. In September of that year Japan's famous Meijin Sen tournament was displayed live on IGS to an audience from many nations. Played in an Amsterdam hotel room by Kobayashi Koichi and Otake Hideo, the game was typed play-by-play by users jansteen and AshaiRey respectively, while watching the game on TV. It was witnessed by over 100 observers on IGS and took 16 hours to complete. A translation command was added to the server in December 1992, allowing users to better communicate with one another, and to translate the long list of commands required to run the early versions of the software.[6] Other activities[edit] Besides being a Go server, Pandanet also hosts several art galleries. The main gallery[7] contains Japanese and Chinese art that has a Go-related theme. Other galleries deal with vintage Go photographs[8] and photography from the 19th and early 20th century, related to San Francisco[9] and Chinatown.[10] Pandanet broadcasts live championship matches for top professional events, including the Meijin, Honinbo, and Judan titles, and the Ricoh Cup professional Pairs tournament.

History[edit] Rev. Henry Ganss Rev. Henry Ganss of Lancaster, Pennsylvania founded the League in New York City, in May 1904, and two months later, it received a Papal blessing from Pius X. Ganss was a fundraiser for the ‘’Preservation Society’’ of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, and he founded the League as a fundraising auxiliary of the Preservation Society. However, the Preservation Society ceased in 1922 while the League continued to thrive. In collaboration with the Bureau, the League distributed the funds and in-kind donations it raised for missions, mission schools and students. It built new missions and satellite chapels and maintained them with supplies; it trained and maintained catechists; and it provided scholarships to students and clothing to the needy. The League had a lay directorate of 25 members, chosen at first from among local councils of the St. Vincent de Paul Society. To further its work, it established branch organizations in several northeastern U.S. cities, including Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It charged an annual membership fee of $2.00 and published ’’The Calumet’’ as a fundraising newsletter from 1913 to 1958. Notable members included Rev. John J. Wynne, S.J., Eugene A. Philbin (1904–1919), Monsignor William Flynn (Director General, 1925–1936) and Rev. Bernard Cullen (Director General, 1937–1957). During its first six years (to 1910), aid from the League provided for the establishment of mission chapels in several states. They included Arizona among the Hopi people; South Dakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and the Rosebud Indian Reservation among the Oglala and Brulé Lakota people respectively; Nebraska on the Winnebago Indian Reservation among the Winnebago people; and North Dakota on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation among the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation. From 1952 to 1958, the League also recruited lay volunteers to serve at missions and schools throughout the United States. The League disbanded in 1991.[citation needed] References[edit] "The Calumet", 1913–1958 http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/ML/ML-sc.shtml Attribution This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Thomas, Meehan (1910).

On 12 August 1944 the Waffen-SS, with the help of the Brigate Nere, murdered about 560 local villagers and refugees, including more than a hundred children, and burned their bodies. These crimes have been defined as voluntary and organized acts of terrorism by the Military Tribunal of La Spezia and the highest Italian court of appeal.[4][5] Contents 1 Massacre 2 Aftermath 2.1 Prosecutions 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References 6 Further reading 7 External links Massacre[edit] An elderly survivor at the village on 14 December 1944 The restored village church and World War I memorial in 2008 On the morning of 12 August 1944, German troops of the 2nd Battalion of SS Panzergrenadier Regiment 35 of 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS, commanded by SS-Hauptsturmführer Anton Galler, entered the mountain village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema. With them came some fascists of the 36th Brigata Nera Benito Mussolini based in Lucca, dressed in German uniforms.[6] The soldiers immediately proceeded to round up villagers and refugees, locking up hundreds of them in several barns and stables, before systematically executing them. The killings were done mostly by shooting groups of people with machine guns or by herding them into basements and other enclosed spaces and tossing in hand grenades. At the 16th-century local church, the priest Fiore Menguzzo (awarded the Medal for Civil Valor posthumously in 1999[7]) was shot at point-blank range, after which machine guns were then turned on some 100 people gathered there. In all, the victims included at least 107 children (the youngest of whom, Anna Pardini, was only 20 days old[8]), as well as eight pregnant women (one of whom, Evelina Berretti, had her stomach cut with a bayonet and her baby pulled out and killed separately[9]). After other people were killed through the village, their corpses were set on fire (at the church, the soldiers used its pews for a bonfire to dispose of the bodies). The livestock were also exterminated and the whole village was burned down. All this took three hours. The SS men then sat down outside the burning Sant'Anna and ate lunch.[10] Aftermath[edit] The National Park of Peace monument in 2007 After the war, the church was rebuilt. The Charnel House Monument and the Historical Museum of Resistance were both built nearby. Stations of the Cross illustrate scenes from the massacre along the trail from the church to the main memorial site—the National Park of Peace, founded in 2000. The massacre inspired the novel Miracle at St. Anna by James McBride, and Spike Lee's film of the same title that was based on it. Prosecutions[edit] List of the victims Apart from the divisional commander Max Simon,[a] no one was prosecuted for this massacre until July 2004, when a trial of ten former Waffen-SS officers and NCOs living in Germany was held before a military court in La Spezia, Italy. On 22 June 2005, the court found the accused guilty of participation in the killings and sentenced them in absentia to life imprisonment:[11] Werner Bruss (b. 1920, former SS-Unterscharführer), Alfred Concina (b. 1919, former SS-Unterscharführer), Ludwig Goering (b. 1923, former SS-Rottenführer who confessed to killing twenty women),[12] Karl Gropler (b. 1923, former SS-Unterscharführer), Georg Rauch (b. 1921, former SS-Untersturmführer), Horst Richter (b. 1921, former SS-Unterscharführer), Alfred Schoneberg (b. 1921, former SS-Unterscharführer), Heinrich Schendel (b. 1922, former SS-Unterscharführer), Gerhard Sommer, (b. 1921, former SS-Untersturmführer), and Ludwig Heinrich Sonntag (b. 1924, former SS-Unterscharführer). However, extradition requests from Italy were rejected by Germany. In 2012, German prosecutors shelved their investigation of 17 unnamed former SS soldiers (eight of whom were still alive) who were part of the unit involved in the massacre because of a lack of evidence.[13] The statement said: "Belonging to a Waffen-SS unit that was deployed to Sant'Anna di Stazzema cannot replace the need to prove individual guilt. Rather, for every defendant it must be proven that he took part in the massacre, and in which form."[14] The mayor of the village, Michele Silicani (a survivor who was 10 when the raid occurred), called the verdict "a scandal" and said he would urge Italy's justice minister to lobby Germany to reopen the case.[15] German deputy foreign minister Michael Georg Link commented that "while respecting the independence of the German justice system," it was not possible "to ignore that such a decision causes deep dismay and renewed suffering to Italians, not just survivors and relatives of the victims."[16] See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Monument to the victims of Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre.

This section does not include school massacres; workplace killings; religious, political or racial crimes; or mass murders that took place primarily in a domestic environment, like familicides, which are covered in their own categories. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another felony, like robbery, are also excluded. A rampage killer has been defined as follows: A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons at least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.[1] This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features: Rampage killings with 6 or more dead Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured) Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured) An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed. In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured. For rampage killers in the United States, see List of rampage killers in the United States.

It succeeded the Tatra 31. Contents 1 Tatra 70 2 Tatra 70A 3 References 4 Sources Tatra 70[edit] The model was launched in 1931, the same year as the Tatra 80, and the two models have the same backbone chassis and swing axle suspension. The front wheels have a rigid axle with overhead transverse leaf springs. The rear wheels are on a swing axle with half transverse leaf springs. The Type 70 has disc wheels, whereas the Type 80 has wire wheels. But the underlying difference is the engine. The Type 80 was given a 5,990 cc, 65-degree V-12 sidevalve engine,[1] but the Type 70 has a water-cooled six-cylinder OHC 3,406 cc engine that produces 65 hp (48 kW).[2] The engine camshaft is driven by a bevel. Transmission is via a multi-plate dry clutch and four-speed gearbox to the rear wheels. The car weighs about 2,400 kg (5,300 lb) and its top speed is 110 km/h (68 mph). The model was offered with a choice of bodies that included a four-seat sedan, two-door coupé,[3] four-door convertible and six-seat limousine.[4] A fire engine version was also built. Total production was 50 cars by 27 April 1932. Tatra 70A[edit] In 1934 the Tatra 70A replaced the 70. Its engine and transmission were derived from the Type 70 but engine capacity was increased to 3,845 cc. This increased performance to 70 hp (52 kW)[5] and top speed to 130 km/h (81 mph). The weight of the revised model is 2,450 kg (5,400 lb). Total production was 70 cars by 28 August 1936. Production ceased in 1937. However, after the Second World War Tatra built one Tatra 70 from spare parts, which it supplied on 23 May 1947 to President Edvard Beneš.

It is standardized by the World Meteorological Organization's Commission for Basic Systems, known under number GRIB FM 92-IX, described in WMO Manual on Codes No.306. Currently there are three versions of GRIB. Version 0 was used to a limited extent by projects such as TOGA, and is no longer in operational use. The first edition (current sub-version is 2) is used operationally worldwide by most meteorological centers, for Numerical Weather Prediction output (NWP). A newer generation has been introduced, known as GRIB second edition, and data is slowly changing over to this format. Some of the second-generation GRIB are used for derived product distributed in Eumetcast of Meteosat Second Generation. Another example is the NAM (North American Mesoscale) model. Contents 1 Format 1.1 GRIB History 1.2 Problems with GRIB [2] 1.3 GRIB 1 Header 2 Software 2.1 Applications 2.2 Mobile Apps 2.2.1 iOS 2.2.2 Android 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Format[edit] GRIB files are a collection of self-contained records of 2D data, and the individual records stand alone as meaningful data, with no references to other records or to an overall schema. So collections of GRIB records can be appended to each other or the records separated. Each GRIB record has two components - the part that describes the record (the header), and the actual binary data itself. The data in GRIB-1 are typically converted to integers using scale and offset, and then bit-packed. GRIB-2 also has the possibility of compression. GRIB History[edit] GRIB superseded the Aeronautical Data Format (ADF). The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Commission for Basic Systems (CBS) met in 1985 to create the GRIB (GRIdded Binary) format. The Working Group on Data Management (WGDM) in February 1994, after major changes, approved revision 1 of the GRIB format. GRIB Edition 2 format was approved in 2003 at Geneva. Problems with GRIB [2][edit] There is no way in GRIB to describe a collection of GRIB records Each record is independent, with no way to reference the GRIB writer's intended schema No foolproof way to combine records into the multidimensional arrays from which they were derived. The use of external tables to describe the meaning of the data. No authoritative place for centers to publish their local tables. Inconsistent and incorrect methods of versioning local tables. No machine-readable versions of the WMO tables (now available for GRIB-2, but not GRIB-1) GRIB 1 Header[edit] There are 2 parts of the GRIB 1 header - one mandatory (Product Definition Section - PDS) and one optional (Grid Description Section - GDS). The PDS describes who created the data (the research / operation center), the involved numerical model / process (can be NWP or GCM), the data that is actually stored (such as wind, temperature, ozone concentration etc.), units of the data (meters, pressure etc.), vertical system of the data (constant height, constant pressure, constant potential temperature), and the time stamp. If a description of the spatial organization of the data is needed, the GDS must be included as well. This information includes spectral (harmonics of divergence and vorticity) vs gridded data (Gaussian, X-Y grid), horizontal resolution, and the location of the origin. Software[edit] Applications[edit] A number of application software packages have been written which make use of GRIB files. These range from command line utilities to graphical visualisation packages.

PyNIO is a Python programming language module that allows read and/or write access to a variety of data formats using an interface modelled on netCDF. degrib (AKA NDFD GRIB2 Decoder) is a reader for GRIB 1 and GRIB 2 files. wgrib2 is a reader for GRIB 2 files. GRIB API is an API developed at ECMWF to decode and encode GRIB edition 1 and 2 data. Note: this package has now been replaced by ecCodes which is a superset of GRIB API. A useful set of command line tools is also included. ECMWF also offers the plotting package Magics and the Metview workstation/batch system to handle/visualise GRIB files. Ugrib – Ugrib is a no cost graphical GRIB viewer designed for reading GRIB 1 files. The website GRIB.US also aims to provide education on the prudent and safe use of GRIB data for forecasting weather. This link is not working as of 20 May 2017. SmartMet - SmartMet is a Windows tool that reads, writes and visualises GRIB data.

He became the 102nd President of the Scottish Rugby Union.[1] Contents 1 Rugby Union career 1.1 Amateur career 1.2 Coaching career 1.3 Referee career 1.4 Administrative career 2 Outside of rugby union 3 Tributes 4 References Rugby Union career[edit] Amateur career[edit] He was educated at Bell Baxter School in Cupar.[2] Pearson played for Howe of Fife.[1][3] Coaching career[edit] He coached at Howe of Fife.[4] Referee career[edit] He refereed rugby union matches.[4] Administrative career[edit] He was first elected to the SRU committee as the Midlands District representative in season 1969–1970.[2] He was Chairman of the Scotland selection committee from 1976 to 1980.[2] He helped to create the SRU coaching panel which installed a national technical director.[4] He managed the Scotland tour to Japan in 1977.[4] Pearson suffered a heart attack in 1980 and stood down from the SRU. He recovered and carried on teaching till 1985 when he retired. He then joined the SRU again as youth convenor. He became the 102nd President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served the standard one year from 1988 to 1989.[5] He was a firm believer in progressing youth rugby and chaired a number of initiatives to develop youth participation.[2] Outside of rugby union[edit] Pearson became a P.E. teacher and also became an Assistant Rector at Buchaven High School.[2] Tributes[edit] Tributes to Pearson came from around Scottish rugby union: David Rollo:[6] He was a great mentor and really was 'Mr Howe of Fife' to me. He guided me through my career really. In his playing days, when he was captain, everything revolved around him and everyone appreciated how he handled players. He always had time to listen to you as a player, and give you his report, without ducking the criticism. There were no coaches then and you were made captain because of what you knew about the game, and Tom knew what he was doing. He also had great expertise in the sevens game and was a major influence on sport at Buckhaven and developing rugby at the Howe and further afield with his work at the SRU. I still remember how he would encourage boys from Buckhaven to come over the hill to the Howe to play, but whatever age they got to they still called him 'Sir', not 'Mr Pearson' and certainly not 'Tom'. He held that respect. Jim Telfer:[6] Tom was one of the originators of the SRU coaching panel that would establish the first coaching courses nationally and regionally. We had a very good coaching advisory panel with a number of PE teachers closely involved, and he was part of the SRU when it appointed the first technical director John Roxburgh. Other sports in Scotland went on to copy what that panel had done with the SRU and we had visitors from across the British Isles and Europe coming to the courses. I remember Tom as a hard-working chap who was a stickler for details and high standards. Ian McLauchlan, the Scotland prop and SRU president:[6] Tom was our team manager on the tour of Japan in 1977 and he had a big input into the SRU at that time. Tom was a very dedicated rugby man, who served the union very well and an altogether decent lad.

Games 1 (a tie), 2, 3 were played in Chicago; games 4 and 5 were played in Detroit. The Cubs came back strong from their shocking loss in the 1906 World Series. The Tigers' young star Ty Cobb came into the Series with the first of his many league batting championships. With pitching dominance over the Tigers and Cobb, the Cubs allowed only three runs in the four games they won, while stealing 18 bases off the rattled Tigers. Tigers pitcher "Wild Bill" Donovan struck out 12 Cubs in Game 1. Although that matched Ed Walsh's total in Game 3 against the Cubs in 1906, it was across 12 innings. Donovan struck out just ten Cubs in the first nine innings of the game.

The Cubs loaded the bases on a single, walk and infield error with one out. Detroit conceded a run on a ground ball for the second out, and Cub player-manager Frank Chance then pinch-hit Del Howard for Joe Tinker. Wild Bill Donovan (25–4 in the regular season) struck him out, but the ball got away from catcher Boss Schmidt, allowing Harry Steinfeldt to score the tying run. Donovan got the next hitter, but the damage had been done. The teams then played three scoreless extra innings before the game was called on account of darkness and declared a tie, a World Series first. This was the closest the Tigers would come to winning a game in this, their first Series. The Cubs committed five errors and struck out 12 times in the game, but nine stolen base attempts (seven successful) and five bunts (two for hits) set an aggressive offensive tone that would pressure the Tigers for the rest of the series.

Chicago scored two more in the fourth on a single, sacrifice bunt, RBI single, stolen base and double to take a 3–1 lead. Jack Pfiester, while allowing ten hits, benefited from two double plays and three caught-stealings by battery-mate Johnny Kling and was the winning pitcher for the Cubs. Joe Tinker scored a run and drove in another in Game 2 after being pinch-hit for in the ninth inning of Game 1. Hughie Jennings recorded the first ejection in World Series history when he argued a caught stealing call by Hank O'Day against Germany Schaefer.[6] Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 R H E Detroit 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 1 Chicago 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 X 3 8 1 WP: Jack Pfiester (1–0) LP: George Mullin (0–1) Game 3[edit] Thursday, October 10, 1907, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois Cub pitcher Ed Reulbach scattered six hits as Chicago jumped on Tiger starter Ed Siever for four runs on seven hits in only four innings en route to their second win.

Soon after play resumed in the same inning, two Cubs reached base on an error and a walk. After Joe Tinker sacrificed, pitcher Orval Overall drove both runners home on a single to right. The Cubs scored three more in the seventh without the ball leaving the infield, on four bunts (two for hits) and two ground balls. Regular-season 23-game winner Overall was masterful after the rain delay, allowing only one hit in Detroit's final five innings, giving his Cubs a commanding 3–0 lead in the Series.

The Cubs scored a run in the top of the first on a walk, stolen base and RBI single by Harry Steinfeldt and scored again in the second on an error, a single, a double-steal and a groundout to drive in the last run of the Series. Detroit had runners on second and third with one out in the last of the fourth, but left them there and never seriously threatened after that. This Series would be the closest to a four-game sweep until the first true Series sweep in 1914, when George Stallings' "miracle" Boston Braves surged from last place in mid-July to win the NL pennant and upset Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics in the Series.

See media help. Websitecfiwest.orghollywoodrealitycheck.comiigwest.org James "Jim" Underdown has been the executive director of The Center for Inquiry (CFI) Los Angeles since 1999. The Center for Inquiry is a non-profit educational organization with headquarters in Amherst, New York, whose primary mission is to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values. CFI Los Angeles is the largest branch in the organization outside Amherst.[1] Underdown founded the Independent Investigations Group (IIG), a volunteer-based organization, in January 2000 at the Center for Inquiry-West (now Center for Inquiry-Los Angeles) in Hollywood, California. The IIG investigates fringe science, paranormal and extraordinary claims from a rational, scientific viewpoint, and disseminates factual information about such inquiries to the public. There are Independent Investigation Groups in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Denver, and Alberta, Canada. Altogether, the Independent Investigations Groups are the largest paranormal investigations team in the world.[2] The IIG offers $250,000[3]:43:15 to anyone who can prove paranormal or supernatural ability under test conditions, and has in the past administered preliminary demonstrations for the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) $1,000,000 Paranormal Challenge.[4][5] Underdown is a 1982 graduate of DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, where he received his B.A. in English with an emphasis in composition.[6][7][8] He was also the starting defensive end for the DePauw Tiger football team which recorded a 9–1 record in 1981.[9] Between 1982 and 1999, he worked as a school teacher, truck driver, painter, limo driver, hotel clerk, furniture mover, football coach, carpenter, and bouncer.[10] In the late 1970s, Underdown tried to win a $500 prize by wrestling a bear .[11] Contents 1 History 2 In the media 3 Articles 4 References 5 External links History[edit] After moving to Los Angeles in 1992, Underdown taught comedy traffic school for the Improv Traffic School and worked as a carpenter until he joined the Center for Inquiry in May 1999. During his time in Los Angeles, He wrote and directed 2 short films: A Day in the Life of Frank Sinatra, a docushort about a homeless man with a famous name, and Dear Father, a black comedy about a priest who gets a letter from a man he molested 20 years before.[12] He also wrote and directed a one-act play called Party of 13, a secular retelling of the Last Supper. Party of 13 has run 3 times in Los Angeles.[13][14][15] He is also the host and creator of "The Peep Show", a humorous roundtable discussion that ran for 2 dozen episodes on public access TV in the mid-1990s.[16] James is lead singer of "The Heathens", a rock and roll band dedicated to freethought and skeptical themes. Band members include lead guitarist and musical director Craig Else, keyboardist Dino Herrmann, bassist Joel Pelletier, and drummer John E. Skaare. The Heathens have played at The Steve Allen Theater in Hollywood and at Patriot Hall in downtown Los Angeles. On March 28, 2013, Craig Else and James Underdown of The Heathens released their first original single, Infallible, on iTunes and other music outlets. Infallible is about the pope, Francis, and his discovery that the greatest thing about the job is infallibility.[17] In 1988 James declared himself Poet Laureate of Calumet City, Illinois, and began touring Midwest comedy clubs as Jim U-Boat, a moniker from high school.[18] In response to Underdown's claim to being Calumet City's poet laureate, its mayor Robert Stefaniak stated that Underdown was "a lousy poet" who was "not recognized by the community".[19] Interviewed by WKQX radio station in front of City Hall, Underdown states although he has never lived or worked in Calumet City, it "reflects the blue-collar nature of my poems".[20][21][19] Notable shows Underdown performed in during the late 1980s/early 1990s include the Serious Art Comedy Show at the Roxy (Chicago), "The Best of Blue Collar Art" at the Elbo Room (Chicago), and "Mr. Saigon" also at the Elbo Room which featured Matt Walsh and Matt Besser of the Upright Citizen's Brigade.[22] In the play written by Terry Curtis Fox, Underdown played a uniformed police officer in Cops. NoHo LA writes "one wishes his role was a bit longer".[23] UFoto at TAM9 What you want to show in image How it is done Underdown created the Steve Allen Theater in 2002 and hired Amit Itelman to be its founding artistic director soon after. According to the NY Times, "...the Steve Allen Theater is not just any theater...it is known for its willingness to embrace controversy. (In June -- 6/6/06 to be exact -- it held a Satanic High Mass for leather and tuxedo-clad devil-worshippers.)"[24] In the media[edit] IIG founder James Underdown with early members of the group, Brian Hart, Milt Timmons & Sherri Andrews, celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the IIG, August 21, 2010 Underdown is one of the co-hosts of the Center for Inquiry's flagship podcast, Point of Inquiry.[25] He and co-host Kavin Senapathy were tapped in October 2018 to be the new interviewers on the longtime show.[26] Underdown is also the co-host, along with Tony Ortega and Jerry Minor, of The Cult Awareness Podcast that discusses Scientology, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other subjects.[27] Underdown billed on the Dr. Phil show as a professional skeptic wrote about his experience as the lone skeptic, "Maybe the show is afraid of challenging the views of so many of their viewers. But it would have nice to have a fair chance to do so".[28] First Underdown read for a small audience as a psychic, then a professional psychic read the same group. This was the first time he had tried to do a group cold-reading and left 3 of the 10 participants in tears. When later it was revealed to the participants that James was a fake psychic, they stated that the professional psychic had given a much better reading. Underdown's response was "of course she is, she is much better practiced". Another psychic claimed that James was actually a real psychic and bitter, he responded, he is not bitter but you make money doing the same thing he can do for free.[29][30] Underdown has appeared in various media, including with Mentalist Mark Edward who were featured on Discovery Channel's episode of Weird or What? "Mind Control War".[31] He has made two appearances on Penn & Teller's Showtime series Bullshit!, Yoga and Tantric Sex where he scams the Tarot Card readers by changing his appearance and behavior.[32] And on the "Talking to the Dead" episode of Season One.[33] On the Oprah Winfrey Network Miracle Detective show Underdown was called in to investigate an angelic apparition that people claim cured a 14-year-old severely disabled child at Presbyterian Hemby Children's Hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. The "angel" was shown to be sunlight from a hidden window, and the little girl is still severely handicapped.[34] Lecturing at skeptical events, Underdown recently spoke on the topic "Are there similarities between the paranormal claims people make today and the miracles found in the Bible?" Underdown takes a look at 5 miracles in the Bible and relates them to real-life paranormal investigations at ReasonFest May 2011.[35][36] Using only invisible thread, a very long pole and a Mr. Coffee pot lid Jim Underdown shows the audience at JREF, The Amaz!ing Meeting: TAM9 From Outer Space how to fake their own UFO photographs.[37] Underdown joined the cast of "Battle of the Psychics" in Kiev, Ukraine in 2012, for the taping of the show's 10th season. He appeared on the show as one of the jury members who analyze the performance of the alleged psychics who are competing for prize money. The show's website reads: "For the first time in history, Battle" in the jury - an outspoken skeptic, internationally known researcher of paranormal phenomena, American James Underdown. Joining Underdown as judges on the show are host Paul Kostitsyn, well-known Russian actress Alika Smekhova, and world famous spoonbender and illusionist, Uri Geller. When asked why he would participate in a show that assumes psychic ability is real, Underdown responded, This is an opportunity to square off with the world's most famous (alleged) psychic in one of the world's biggest hotbeds of psychic belief. Why not try to bring some skepticism where it is so sorely needed?[38][39] Appearing in the short Secularism - A Short Film Underdown along with others reenacts Robert G. Ingersoll's 1887 essay Secularism.[40] Underdown interviewed by Chris Brown about his involvement with the IIG.[41] Speaking to the Santa Monica College's newly formed skeptic club, Underdown said, "'Critical thinking skills, not just with this stuff, the idea of being able to know the difference between what's true and what isn’t, will serve you very well in your life in many different ideas"'.[42] Underdown has appeared in several feature films including Matt Walsh's The High Road, Super High Me with Doug Benson, Wild Girls Gone with Matt Besser, and as former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo in Stephen Vittoria's Long Distance Revolutionary[43] Articles[edit] James Underdown being interviewed during a shoot for Discovery Channel's Weird or What? Mind Control War August 2010. Underdown writes the Ask the Atheist blog on the Center for Inquiry's main website, https://centerforinquiry.org/. This humorous commentary on current issues that affect freethinkers is written through the eyes of a non-believer.[44] "Dr. Phil and the Hummingbird" Article in November/December 2014 issue of Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Underdown discusses how a well-known medium named Rebecca Rosen creates the illusion of speaking to the dead. Big Picture Science-Skeptic Check Underdown discusses vortex, ghosts and the Winchester Mystery House.[45] "State Sponsored Quackery" Article in the November/December 2009 issue of Skeptical Inquirer magazine.

With a $225,000 grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the symposium asked scientists and media representatives from Pixar and Disney to brainstorm creative ways to empower student learning in science. Underdown writes that "many a false belief rests on a poor understanding...of how the universe works" improving science education now will demystify public misunderstandings in the future. Some of the luminaries included Ralph Cicerone, Charles Vest, Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Brian Greene.[47] "Mother (Nature) Dearest" OpEd in the August/September issue of Free Inquiry magazine. Can three hardcore atheists have a spiritual experience while hiking into the Grand Canyon? "They See Dead People: Or Do They?" Article in the September/October 2003 issue of Skeptical Inquirer magazine. How do TV mediums John Edward and James Van Praagh appear to be talking to the dead? The IIG discovered that what was actually said on the tape day, and what was broadcast to the public were "substantially different in the accuracy. They're getting rid of the wrong guesses... Once you pull back the curtain and see how it's done, it's not impressive at all."[48][49] "The Evolution of Thought" OpEd in Spring 2001 issue of Free Inquiry magazine.

Loeb John L. LoebHeadquartersNew York City, United States Loeb, Rhoades & Co. was a Wall Street brokerage firm founded in 1931 and acquired in 1979 by Sanford I. Weill's Shearson Hayden Stone. Although the firm would operate as Shearson Loeb Rhoades for two years, the firm would ultimately be acquired in 1981 by American Express to form Shearson/American Express and three years later Shearson Lehman/American Express. Contents 1 History 2 Loeb Partners Corporation 3 Acquisition history 4 Notable alumni 5 See also 6 References 7 External links History[edit] The firm was founded as Carl M. Loeb & Co. by father Carl M. Loeb and son John Langeloth Loeb Sr. in 1931, shortly after the onset of the Great Depression. Carl M. Loeb & Co. merged with Rhoades & Company, a white shoe Wall Street brokerage firm, in 1937 to form what became Loeb, Rhoades & Co. Rhoades & Company had been founded in 1905 by John Harsen Rhoades, Jr. (born 1869), formerly a partner of Rhoades & Richmond.[1] The firm operated under the Loeb, Rhoades name from 1937 through 1979 when it briefly used the name Shearson Loeb Rhoades, for two years prior to its acquisition by American Express in 1981. Carl Loeb, who had built his personal wealth as president of American Metal Company resigned from the company and bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, at the urging of his son John in 1931. While on the New York Stock Exchange, he pushed through many reforms.[2] Three years after Loeb left American Metals, the company's stock was nearly worthless.[3] Together with his son, Carl ran Loeb, Rhoades for its first 24 years, from 1931 until his death in 1955. John L. Loeb was a partner in the firm from 1931 to 1955 and following the death of his father became the senior partner, a role which he retained through 1977 when the firm was merged. In 1951, John Loeb became a governor of the New York Stock Exchange. In 1956, Loeb, Rhoades acquired a controlling interest in the Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company and sold its stake on December 31, 1958, a day before the Cuban Revolution.[4] In 1973, Carl M. Mueller assumed management control of the firm before Loeb resumed his management responsibilities in the firm in 1977. Loeb oversaw the merger of Loeb, Rhoades with Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask to form Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. in January 1978 before handing over day to day control of the firm to his nephew, Thomas Kempner, a grandson of Carl Loeb who had joined the firm in 1950.[4] The Hornblower merger turned out to be disastrous for Loeb, Rhoades. The two firms incurred significant costs attempting to merge their back office operations, both of which had issues prior to the merger. By the end of 1978, less than a year after the merger, the combined firm was losing millions of dollars. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Sanford I. Weill was acquiring brokerage firms and by 1979 was running Shearson Hayden Stone, the culmination of nearly a dozen acquisitions. By early 1979, Loeb, Rhoades, now known as Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. was suffering and looking for a potential acquiror. During Mothers Day Weekend 1979, Loeb and Shearson agreed to a merger to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades. Weill was named the CEO of the combined firm and John Loeb became the firm's chairman. At the time, Shearson Loeb Rhoades was among the largest investment banking houses with $250 million of equity capital.[4][5] In 1981, Shearson Loeb Rhoades bought the Boston Company, a money manager. The same year, Weill sold the combined company to American Express to form Shearson/American Express. Loeb Partners Corporation[edit] Loeb Partners Corporation, a registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, had close ties with Loeb, Rhoades. Loeb Partners Corporation was founded by Thomas L. Kempner in 1982 to focus on managing assets for the Loeb family, wealthy clientele and institutions. Kempner, a grandson of Carl M. Loeb, was the final chairman of Loeb, Rhoades, serving from 1978 until the sale of the company in 1979. Loeb Partners launched the Loeb Arbitrage Fund in 1988 as an investment vehicle for the Loeb family and other family office clients. In 2008, Loeb Capital Management, a d/b/a for Loeb Arbitrage Management, Loeb Offshore Management and Carl M. Loeb Advisory Partners Inc., was launched under common control with Loeb Partners Corporation. In 2013 Loeb Capital Management was renamed Loeb King Capital Management.

At a height of approximately 866 feet (264 m), the world's third highest amusement ride, located on top of the Stratosphere Las Vegas. The name of the ride is a play on the word extreme.[3] Ride experience[edit] X-Scream comprises 68 ft (21 m)[2] straight piece of track similar to that of a conventional roller coaster, which carries a single open top car. This trackway pivots vertically in a see-saw motion, letting the car roll backward and forward along the length. The ride car is allowed to roll quickly forward to the end of the track, 27 feet (8.2 m) past the edge of the building,[4] before braking sharply. The rolling back and forth of the car and the rocking of the track is programmed to take the rider by surprise and feel like they are at risk of falling from the precipice of the building.

It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and two chimneys. The main facade faces south (not to the street, which lies to the west), and has a single-story porch extending across its width, supported by square posts. The building corners are pilastered, and a single-story bay projects from the west side. The house is locally distinctive as a rare Federal period house with a hip roof and later applied Italianate styling.[2] See also[edit] National Register of Historic Places listings in Reading, Massachusetts National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts References[edit] ^ a b "National Register Information System".

Wilstedt belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown – interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) – and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807 the ephemeral Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which – after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 – incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory, including Wilstedt, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.

She is currently a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party. She was formerly the policy chief of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP), and later the president and sole member of the short-lived Tomorrow Party of Japan. Abe attended Ochanomizu Women's University and studied at the medical faculty of Tokyo University , graduating in 1974. She worked as a pediatrician in various hospitals, including at the Mayo Clinic in the US in the 1990s. She also worked for the Tokushukai Group in Chiba and Kamakura. She has continued to be employed by the group, but does not actively work after her switch to politics in 2000. In the 2000 Shūgiin election, Abe ran for the SDP in the 12th constituency of Kanagawa but lost by a large margin behind the other candidates of the major parties; however, she was elected via the South Kantō proportional electoral block and has been a member of the Shūgiin since 2000. After Masako Ōwaki left the party, Abe became her successor in 2003 as chair of the SDP's Political Research Council . Before the Shūgiin election in 2012, Abe left the SDP[1] and joined the TPJ, founded by governor of Shiga Prefecture Yukiko Kada. The party performed poorly in the election and all the remaining diet members save Abe quit the party, meaning that the TPJ could not maintain official party status in the diet, which requires five members. Abe and Kada contacted Green Wind, which had four Diet members, over a possible merger, but the talks were not successful.[2] However, they did not contest the Shūgiin election in favor of the Tomorrow Party of Japan , and Abe ran for them instead. In the Kanagawa 12 constituency, she was able to surpass the Democratic incumbent Ikko Nakatsuka, but was defeated by the Liberal Democrat Tsuyoshi Hoshino. With a comparatively short constituency defeat, she won number 1 on the list of the Tomorrow Party in South Kantō and won her only proportional election mandate. When the party split shortly after the new parliament met, Abe remained the only MP from both chambers from the Tomorrow Party. In January 2013 she took over the party chairmanship from Yukiko Kada.[3] In May 2012 she joined the Green Wind and became deputy chair. Following the dissolution of the Green Wind at the end of 2013, Abe joined the Democratic Party before the 2014 Shūgiin election . She was defeated by less than 1000 votes behind Tsuyoshi Hoshino, but achieved the number 1 on the list of Democrats in the proportional electoral block South Kantō and was surely elected. In the split of the Democratic Party before the 2017 Shūgiin election, she joined the Constitutional Democratic Party of Yukio Edano and narrowly won Kanagawa 12.[4] Abe is also a leader of a group of lawmakers called Energy Shift Japan, who are pushing the government to consider alternatives to nuclear power subsequent to the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in March 2011. Abe and Energy Shift Japan are backing a proposal to give green energy sources access to Japan's power grid.

Krainov, developed the ADK formula, relating tunneling ionization in laser fields.[1] He was also a lecturer at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.[1] After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he travelled abroad and worked on international collaborations on multiphoton physics.[1] His son was Vadim Delaunay, a poet and dissident, who participated in the 1968 Red Square demonstration of protest against military suppression of the Prague Spring. Publications[edit] Delone published over 200 scientific papers, a four-book series on the physics of strong laser fields and on multiphoton physics, and a series of high-school level Russian textbooks.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h Vladimir P.

Demographics[edit] The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the commune since 1793. From January 1, 2009, The legal populations of the communes are published annually in the framework of a census which is now based on an annual information gathering, successively covering all the communal territories over a period of five years. For municipalities with less than 10 000 inhabitants, a census survey covering the entire population is carried out every five years, the legal populations of the intermediate years being estimated by interpolation or extrapolation 1 . For the commune, the first comprehensive census under the new system was carried out in 2006 2, Note 1 . In 2014, the municipality had 501 inhabitants, a decrease of -1.18% compared with 2009 ( Ariège : 0.95%, France excluding Mayotte : 2.49%).

Its name derives from Warsaw W-Z Route, on which the cake shop which first started to sell the dessert at the turn of the 1940s was located. Originally the dessert was served by cafés and restaurants, but soon it became a beloved home-made food in Poland. Wuzetka is made of two layers of chocolate sponge layered with Polish marmalade (which is almost never made of citrus fruits) or jam and whipped cream, topped with chocolate icing and dots of whipped cream.

As a DEW line base, it was disbanded in years 1990/1991.[1] An ice core is a core sample from the accumulation of snow and ice that has re-crystallized and trapped air bubbles over many years. The composition of these ice cores, especially the presence of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, provides a picture of the climate at the time. Ice cores contain an abundance of climate information. Inclusions in the snow, such as wind-blown dust, ash, bubbles of atmospheric gas and radioactive substances, remain in the ice. The variety of climatic proxies is greater than in any other natural recorder of climate, such as tree rings or sediment layers. These include (proxies for) temperature, ocean volume, precipitation, chemistry and gas composition of the lower atmosphere, volcanic eruptions, solar variability, sea-surface productivity, desert extent and forest fires. Typical ice cores are removed from an ice sheet such as the ice cap internal to Greenland. Greenland is, by area, the world's largest island. The Greenland ice sheet covers about 1.71 million km2 and contains about 2.6 million km3 of ice.[2] Contents 1 Greenland ice sheet 2 Distant Early Warning Line 3 Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP) 4 Dye 3 cores 4.1 Dye 3 1971 4.2 Dye 3 1973 4.3 Dye 3 1975 4.4 Dye 3 1976 4.5 Dye 3 1978 4.6 Dye 3 1979 4.7 Shear conditions 4.8 Core continuity 4.9 Counting annual layers 4.10 Ice crystal diameter distribution 4.11 Beryllium 10 variations 4.12 Dust concentration 4.13 Ice ages 4.14 Fossils 4.15 Dye 3 1988 5 Comparison with other Greenland ice cores 5.1 Camp Century 1963 5.1.1 Counting annual layers 5.2 Crête 1972 5.3 Milcent 1973 5.3.1 Ice ages 5.4 Renland 1985 5.4.1 Inclusions in the ice 5.4.2 Ice ages 5.5 GRIP 1989 5.5.1 Inclusions in the ice 5.6 GISP2 1989 5.6.1 Visual stratigraphy 5.7 North Greenland Ice Core Project 1996 5.7.1 Shear conditions 5.7.2 Ice crystal diameter distribution 5.7.3 Ice ages 5.7.4 Fossils 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Greenland ice sheet[edit] Main article: Greenland ice sheet Satellite composite image of Greenland. The 'Greenland ice sheet' (Greenlandic: Sermersuaq) is a vast body of ice covering 1.71 million km2, roughly 80% of the surface of Greenland. It is the second largest ice body in the World, after the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The ice sheet is almost 2,400 kilometers long in a north-south direction, and its greatest width is 1,100 kilometers at a latitude of 77°N, near its northern margin. The mean altitude of the ice is 2,135 meters.[3] The ice in the current ice sheet is as old as 110,000 years.[4] However, it is generally thought that the Greenland Ice Sheet formed in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene by coalescence of ice caps and glaciers. It did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very rapidly with the first continental glaciation. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost 3,000 metres at latitudes 63°–65°N; the northern dome reaches about 3,290 metres at about latitude 72°N. The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. On the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about −31 °C (−24 °F), occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about −20 °C (−4 °F). During winter, the ice sheet takes on a strikingly clear blue/green color. During summer, the top layer of ice melts leaving pockets of air in the ice that makes it look white. Positioned in the Arctic, the Greenland ice sheet is especially vulnerable to global warming. Arctic climate is now rapidly warming. Distant Early Warning Line[edit] Map of Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line Stations in Greenland, west to east: Dye 1, Dye 2, Dye 3, and Dye 4. Dye-2 and 3 were among 58 Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line radar stations built by the United States of America (USA) between 1955 and 1960 across Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Iceland at a cost of billions of dollars. After extensive studies in late 1957, the US Air Force (USAF) selected sites for two radar stations on the ice cap in southern Greenland. The DYE stations were the eastern extension of the DEW Line. DYE-1 was on the West Coast at Holsteinsborg; DYE-4 on the East Coast at Kulusuk. Dye 2 (66°29'30"N 46°18'19"W, 2338 masl) was built approximately 100 miles east of Sondrestrom AB and 90 miles south of the Arctic Circle at an altitude of 7,600 feet. Dye 3 was located approximately 100 miles east of Dye 2 and slightly south at an elevation of 8,600 feet, contrary to USAF map above. The sites were constructed with materials provided through airlift from C-130D’sFrom the 17 TCS from Seward AFB, TN. flying out of Sonderstrom AB now Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. The new radar sites were found to receive from three to four feet of snow each year. The snow was formed into large drifts by winds constantly blowing as much as 100 mph. To overcome this, the Dye sites were elevated approximately 20 feet above the ice cap surface. Dye 3 was completed in 1960. Due to snow accretion, the station was "jacked up" again in the late 1970s, but by the 1990s needed further elevation. Instead, Dye 3 was closed as a radar station in the years 1990/1991. Today, it is used as a training site for the 139th Airlift Squadron Flying LC-130’s. Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP)[edit] Main article: Greenland Ice Sheet Project The Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP) was a decade-long project to drill 20[5] ice cores in Greenland. GISP involved scientists and funding agencies from Denmark, Switzerland and the United States. Besides the U.S. National Science Foundation, funding was provided by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Danish Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland. The ice cores provide a proxy archive of temperature and atmospheric constituents that help to understand past climate variations. Annual field expeditions were carried out to drill intermediate depth cores at various locations on the ice sheet: Dye 3 in 1971 to 372 m North Site (75°46’N 42°27’W, 2870 masl) in 1972 to 15 m North Central (74°37’N 39°36’W) in 1972 to 100 m Crête (71°7’N 37°19’W) in 1972 to 15 m Milcent (70°18’N 45°35’W, 2410 masl) in 1973 to 398 m Dye 2 (66°23’N 46°11’W) in 1973 to 50 m Dye 3 in 1973, an intermediate drilling to c. 390 m Crête in 1974 to 404.64 m Dye 2 in 1974 to 101 m Summit (71°17’N 37°56’W, 3212 masl) in 1974 to 31 m Dye 3 in 1975 to 95 m South Dome (63°33’N 44°36’W, 2850 masl) in 1975 to 80 m Hans Tausen (82°30’N 38°20’W, 1270 masl) in 1975 to 60 m Dye 3 in 1976 to 93 m Hans Tausen in 1976 to 50 m Hans Tausen in 1977 to 325 m Camp Century (77°10’N 61°8’W, 1885 masl) in 1977 to 49 m Dye 2 in 1977 to 84 m Camp III (69°43’N 50°8’W) in 1977 to 84 m Dye 3 1978 to 90 m Camp III in 1978 to 80 m. “On most of the Greenland ice sheet, however, the annual accumulation rate is considerably higher than 0.2 m ice a−1, and the delta method therefore works thousands of years backwards in time, the only limitation being obliteration of the annual delta cycles by diffusion of the water molecule in the solid ice....”[6] Delta refers to the changing proportion of oxygen-18 in the different seasonal layers. “The main reason for the seasonal delta variations is that, on its travel to the polar regions, a precipitating air mass is generally cooled more in winter than in summer.”[6] “... the annual layer thickness...decreases from 19 cm in 2,000-year-old ice to 2 cm in 10,000-year-old ice due to plastic thinning of the annual layers as they sink towards greater depths10.”[7] “... volcanic acids in snow layers deposited shortly after a large volcanic eruption can be detected – as elevated specific conductivities measured on melted ice samples8, or as elevated acidities revealed by an electric current through the solid ice...”[7] Dye 3 cores[edit] Although available GISP data gathered over the earlier seven years, pointed to north-central Greenland as the optimum site location for the first deep drilling, financial restrictions forced the selection of the logistically convenient Dye-3 location. Dye 3 1971[edit] Preliminary GISP field work started in 1971 at Dye 3 (65°11′N 43°49′W﻿ / ﻿65.183°N 43.817°W﻿ / 65.183; -43.817﻿ (Dye 3)), where a 372 meter deep, 10.2 cm diameter core was recovered using a Thermal (US) drill type. Three more cores to depths of 90, 93, and 95 m were drilled with different drill types. Dye 3 1973[edit] For an intermediate drilling c. 390 m, the drill was installed 25 m below the surface at the bottom of the Dye 3 radar station. Some 740 seasonal δ18 cycles were counted, indicating that the core reached back to 1231 AD. Evident in this coring was that as melt water seeps through the porous snow, it refreezes somewhere in the cold firn and disturbs the layer sequence. Dye 3 1975[edit] A second core at Dye 3 was drilled in 1975 with a Shallow (Swiss) drill type to 95 m at 7.6 cm diameter. Dye 3 1976[edit] A third core at Dye 3 was drilled in 1976 with a Wireline (US) drill type, 10.2 cm diameter, to 93 m. Dye 3 1978[edit] Another core at Dye 3 was drilled in 1978 using a Shallow (US) drill type, 10.2 cm diameter, to 90 m. Measurements of [SO42−] and [NO3−] in firn samples spanning the period 1895–1978 were taken from the Dye 3 1978 core down to 70 m.[8] Dye 3 1979[edit] In 1979, the initial Dye-3 deep bedrock drilling was started using a 22.2 cm diameter CRREL thermal (US) coring drill to produce an 18 cm diameter access hole, which was cased, to a depth of 77 m. The large diameter casing was inserted over the porous firn zone to contain the drilling fluid.[9] After working out various logistical and engineering problems related to the development of a more sophisticated drilling rig, drilling to bedrock at Dye 3 began in the summer of 1979 using a new Danish electro-mechanical ice drill yielding a 10.2 cm diameter core. From July to August 1979 using ISTUK, 273 m of core was removed.[10] At the end of the 1980 field season ISTUK had gnawed down to 901 m. In 1981 at a depth of 1785 m dust and conductivity measurements indicated the beginning of ice from the last glaciation.[10] Coring continued and on August 10, 1981, bedrock was reached at a depth of 2038 m. The depth range for the Danish drill was 80–2038 m. The Dye 3 site was a compromise: glaciologically, a higher site on the ice divide with smooth bedrock would have been better; logistically, such a site would have been too remote. The borehole is 41.5 km east of the local ice divide of the south Greenland ice sheet.[11] Shear conditions[edit] The Dye 3 cores were part of the GISP and, at 2037 meters, the final Dye 3 1979 core was the deepest of the 20 ice cores recovered from the Greenland ice sheet.[5] The surface ice velocity is 12.5 ma−1, 61.2° true.[11] At 500 m above bedrock, the ice velocity is ~10 ma−1, 61.2° true.[11] The ice upstream and downstream from Dye 3 is flowing downhill (-) on ~0.48 % mean slope.[11] The bedrock temperature is −13.22 °C (as of 1984).[11] Core continuity[edit] The Dye 3 1979 core is not completely intact and is not undamaged. “Below 600 m, the ice became brittle with increasing depth and badly fractured between 800 and 1,200 m. The physical property of the core progressively improved and below ~1,400 m was of excellent quality.”[12] “The deep ice core drilling terminated in August 1981. The ice core is 2035 m long and has a diameter of 10 cm. It was drilled with less than 6° deviation from vertical, and less than 2 m is missing. The deepest 22 m consists of silty ice with an increasing concentration of pebbles downward. In the depth interval 800 to 1400 m the ice was extremely brittle, and even careful handling unavoidably damaged this part of the core, but the rest of the core is in good to excellent condition.”[13] The depth interval 800 to 1400 m would be a period approximately from about two thousand years ago to about five or six thousand years ago.[14] Melting has been commonplace throughout the Holocene. Summer melting is usually the rule at Dye 3, and there is occasional melting even in north Greenland. All of these meltings disturb the clarity of the annual record to some degree. “An exceptionally warm spell can produce features which extend downwards by percolation, along isolated channels, into the snow of several previous years. This can happen in regions which generally have little or no melting at the snow surface as exemplified during mid July 1954 in north-west Greenland4. Such an event could lead to the conclusion that two or three successive years had abnormally warm summers, whereas all the icing formed during a single period which lasted for several days. The location where melt features will have the greatest climactic significance is high in the percolation facies where summer melting is common but deep percolation is minimal4. Dye 3 in southern Greenland (65°11’N; 43°50’W) is such a location.”[15] Counting annual layers[edit] As the drill site of Dye 3 receives more than twice as much accumulation as central Greenland, the annual layers are well resolved and relatively thick in the upper parts, making the core ideal for dating the most recent millennia.[16] But, the high accumulation rate has resulted in relatively rapid ice flow (flow-induced layer thinning and diffusion of isotopes), Dye 3 1979 cannot be used for annual layer counting much more than 8 kyr back in time.[16] Ice crystal diameter distribution[edit] Crystal diameters range from ~0.2 cm at 1900 m from bedrock (depth 137 m) to ~0.42 cm vertical diameter (v) and ~0.55 cm horizontal diameter (h) at 300 m above bedrock (depth 1737 m).[11] However, below 300 m crystal diameter decreases rapidly with increasing dust concentration to a minimum of ~0.05 cm at 200 m above bedrock (depth 1837 m), increasing again linearly to ~0.25 cm v and ~0.3 cm h just above bedrock.[11] Crystal diameters remain approximately constant between 1400 and 300 m above bedrock (depths 637–1737 m), with the largest crystals and the largest distortion (~0.55 cm v and ~0.7 cm h) occurring at 1100 m above bedrock (depth 937 m).[11] The brittle zone mentioned above under "Core continuity" corresponds in Dye 3 1979 with the steady state grain size (crystal size) from ~637 to ~1737 m depth range. This is also the Holocene climatic optimum period. Beryllium 10 variations[edit] As of 1998 the only long record available for 10Be is from Dye 3 1979.[17] Questions were raised whether all parts of the Dye 3 1979 record reflect the sun activity or are affected by climatic and/or ice dynamics.[17] Dust concentration[edit] The dust concentration has a peak of ~3 mg/kg at 200 m above bedrock (depth 1837 m), second only to the silty ice (>20 mg/kg) of the bottom 25 m, which has a very high deformation rate.[11] Ice ages[edit] The uppermost 1780 m is considered Holocene ice, and the lower portion is considered as deposited during the Wisconsin period.[11] From the δ18 O profile of the Dye 3 core it is relatively easy to differentiate the post-glacial climatic optimum, portions thereof and earlier: the Pre-Boreal transition, the Allerød, Bølling, Younger Dryas, and Oldest Dryas. In the Dye 3 1979 oxygen isotope record, the Older Dryas appears as a downward peak establishing a small, low-intensity gap between the Bølling and the Allerød. During the transition from the Younger Dryas to the Pre-Boreal, the South Greenland temperature increased by 15 °C in 50 years. At the beginning of this same transition the deuterium excess and dust concentration shifted to lower levels in less than 20 years.[13] The post-glacial climatic optimum lasted from ~9000–4000 yrs B.P. as determined from Dye 3 1979 and Camp Century 1963 δ18 O profiles. Both Dye 3 1979 and Camp Century 1963 cores exhibit the 8.2 ka event and the boundary event separating Holocene I from Holocene II.[13] Fossils[edit] Samples from the base of the 2 km deep Dye 3 1979 and the 3 km deep GRIP cores revealed that high-altitude southern Greenland has been inhabited by a diverse array of conifer trees and insects within the past million years.[18] Dye 3 1988[edit] Ellen Mosley-Thompson led a 3-man glaciological team to drill an intermediate depth core at Dye 3, Greenland. Comparison with other Greenland ice cores[edit] For a map of the locations of the various Greenland ice cap corings, see ref.[19] A graphical description of changes in temperature in Greenland from AD 500 – 1990 based on analysis of the deep ice core from Greenland and some historical events. The annual temperature changes are shown vertical in ˚C. The numbers are to be read horizontal: 1. From AD 700 to 750 people belonging to the Late Dorset Culture move into the area around Smith Sound, Ellesmere Island and Greenland north of Thule. 2. Norse settlement of Iceland starts in the second half of the 9th century. 3. Norse settlement of Greenland starts just before the year 1000. 4. Thule Inuit move into northern Greenland in the 12th century. 5. Late Dorset culture disappears from Greenland in the second half of the 13th century. 6. The Western Settlement disappears in mid 14th century. 7. In 1408 is the Marriage in Hvalsey, the last known written document on the Norse in Greenland. 8. The Eastern Settlement disappears in mid 15th century. 9. John Cabot is the first European in the post-Iceland era to visit Labrador – Newfoundland in 1497. 10. “Little Ice Age” from ca 1600 to mid 18th century. 11. The Norwegian priest, Hans Egede, arrives in Greenland in 1721. To investigate the possibility of climatic cooling, scientists drilled into the Greenland ice caps to obtain core samples. The oxygen isotopes from the ice caps suggested that the Medieval Warm Period had caused a relatively milder climate in Greenland, lasting from roughly 800 to 1200. However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, we know that the "Little Ice Age" had reached intense levels in Greenland.[20] For most of the arctic ice cores up to 1987, regions of the core with high dust concentrations correlate well with the ice having high deformation rates and small crystal diameters, in both Holocene and Wisconsin ice.[11] Camp Century 1963[edit] The Camp Century, Greenland, ice core (cored from 1963–1966) is 1390 m deep and contains climatic oscillations with periods of 120, 940, and 13,000 years.[21] Counting annual layers[edit] “Thus in principle dating of the Camp Century ice core by counting annual layers is possible to about the 1,060 m depth, corresponding to 8,300 yr BP according to the time scale which we shall adopt.”[22] “It may be necessary, however, to apply a depth dependent correction to account for ‘lost’ annual oscillations. Even during firnification seasonal δ-oscillations in years with unusually low accumulation may disappear due to mass exchange. Unfortunately, the physical condition (broken or missing pieces) of the Camp Century ice core precludes continuous measurement of seasonal isotope variations for the purpose of dating from the surface downward.”[22] Crête 1972[edit] The Crête core was drilled in central Greenland (1974) and reached a depth of 404.64 meters, extending back only about fifteen centuries.[23] Milcent 1973[edit] "The first core drilled at Station Milcent in central Greenland covers the past 780 years."[24] Milcent core was drilled at 70.3°N, 44.6°W, 2410 masl.[24] The Milcent core (398 m) was 12.4 cm in diameter, using a Thermal (US) drill type, in 1973. Ice ages[edit] The Milcent core record only goes back to AD 1174 (Holocene) due to the high accumulation rates.[16] Renland 1985[edit] The Renland ice core was drilled in 1985.[13] The Renland ice core from East Greenland apparently covers a full glacial cycle from the Holocene into the previous Eemian interglacial. The Renland ice core is 325 m long.[25] From the delta-profile, the Renland ice cap in the Scoresbysund Fiord has always been separated from the inland ice, yet all the delta-leaps revealed in the Camp Century 1963 core recurred in the Renland ice core.[13] Inclusions in the ice[edit] The Renland core is noted for apparently containing the first Northern Hemisphere record of methanesulfonate (MSA), and having the first continuous record of non-seasalt sulfate.[26] The Renland core is also the first to provide a continuous record of ammonium (NH4+) apparently through the whole glacial period.[25] The distribution of 10Be in the top 40 m of the Renland ice core has been reported and corroborates the 10Be cyclic fluctuation pattern from Dye 3.[17] Ice ages[edit] The Renland core apparently contains ice from the Eemian onward.[25] GRIP 1989[edit] GRIP successfully drilled a 3028-metre ice core to the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet at Summit, Central Greenland from 1989 to 1992 at 72°35′N 37°38′W﻿ / ﻿72.583°N 37.633°W﻿ / 72.583; -37.633, 3238 masl. Inclusions in the ice[edit] Eight ash layers have been identified in the central Greenland ice core GRIP.[27] Four of the ash layers (Ash Zones I and II, Saksunarvatn and the Settlement layer) originating in Iceland have been identified in GRIP by comparison of chemical composition of glass shards from the ash.[27] The other four have not been correlated with known ash deposits.[27] The Saksunarvatn tephra via radiocarbon dating is ca 10,200 years BP. GISP2 1989[edit] The follow-up U.S. GISP2 project drilled at a glaciologically better location on the summit (72°36'N, 38°30'W, 3200 masl). This hit bedrock (and drilled another 1.55 m into bedrock) on July 1, 1993 after five years of drilling. European scientists produced a parallel core in the GRIP project. GISP2 produced an ice core 3053.44 meters in depth, the deepest ice core recovered in the world at the time.[28] The GRIP site was 30 km to the east of GISP2. "Down to a depth of 2790 m in GISP2 (corresponding to an age of about 110 kyr B.P.), the GISP2 and GRIP records are nearly identical in shape and in many of the details."[28] Visual stratigraphy[edit] The GISP2 time scale is based on counting annual layers primarily by visual stratigraphy. 19 cm long section of GISP 2 ice core from 1855 m showing annual layer structure illuminated from below by a fiber optic source. Section contains 11 annual layers with summer layers (arrowed) sandwiched between darker winter layers. The isotopic temperature records show 23 interstadial events correlateable between the GRIP and GISP2 records between 110 and 15 kyr B.P.[28] Ice in both cores below 2790 m depth (records prior to 110 kyr B.P.) shows evidence of folding or tilting in structures too large to be fully observed in a single core.[28] The bulk of the GISP2 ice core is archived at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Lakewood, Colorado, United States. Photograph of a section of the GISP2 ice core from 1837 m depth with clearly visible annual layers. The white bands are considered from summer snow and the clear bands from winter snow. North Greenland Ice Core Project 1996[edit] The drilling site of the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) is near the center of Greenland (75.1 N, 42.32 W, 2917 m, ice thickness 3085). Drilling began in 1999 and was completed at bedrock in on July 17, 2003.[29] The NGRIP site was chosen to extract a long and undisturbed record stretching into the last glacial, and it was apparently successful. Unusually, there is melting at the bottom of the NGRIP core – believed to be due to a high geothermal heat flux locally. This has the advantage that the bottom layers are less compressed by thinning than they would otherwise be: NGRIP annual layers at 105 kyr age are 1.1 cm thick, twice the GRIP thicknesses at equal age. Shear conditions[edit] The site was chosen for a flat basal topography to avoid the flow distortions that render the bottom of the GRIP and GISP cores unreliable. Ice crystal diameter distribution[edit] In the upper 80 m of the ice sheet, the firn or the snow gradually compacts to a close packing of ice crystals of typical sizes 1 to 5 mm.[30] Crystal size distributions were obtained from fifteen vertical thin sections of 20 cm × 10 cm (height × width) and a thickness of 0.4 ±0.1 mm of ice evenly distributed in the depth interval 115 – 880 m.[30] Peak sizes with depth were ~1.9 mm 115 m, ~2.2 mm 165 m, ~2.8 mm 220 m, ~3.0 mm 330 m, ~3.2 mm 440 m, ~3.3 mm 605 m, whereas mean sizes with depth were ~1.8 115 m, ~2.2 mm 165 m, ~2.4 mm 220 m, ~2.8 mm ~270 m, ~2.75 mm 330 m, ~2.6 mm ~370 m, ~2.9 mm 440 m, ~2.8 mm ~490 m, ~2.9 mm ~540 m, ~2.9 mm 605 m, ~3.0 ~660 m, ~3.2 mm ~720 m, ~2.9 mm ~770 m, ~2.7 mm ~820 m, ~2.8 mm 880 m.[30] And, here again as with Dye 3, steady state in grain growth was reached and continued through the post-glacial climatic optimum. The size distribution of ice crystals changes with depth and approaches the Normal Grain Growth law via competing mechanisms of fragmentation (producing smaller polygonal grains) and grain boundary diffusion (producing larger, vertically compressed, horizontally expanded grains).[30] Although some of the peaks for the deeper distributions appear to be slightly greater, the predicted steady state average grain size is 2.9±0.1 mm.[30] Ice ages[edit] The NGRIP record helps to resolve a problem with the GRIP record – the unreliability of the Eemian Stage portion of the record. NGRIP covers 5 kyr of the Eemian, and shows that temperatures then were roughly as stable as the pre-industrial Holocene temperatures were. This is confirmed by sediment cores, in particular MD95-2042.[31] Fossils[edit] In 2003, NGRIP recovered what seem to be plant remnants nearly two miles below the surface, and they may be several million years old.[19] "Several of the pieces look very much like blades of grass or pine needles," said University of Colorado at Boulder geological sciences Professor James White, an NGRIP principal investigator. "If confirmed, this will be the first organic material ever recovered from a deep ice-core drilling project," he said.

It originally aired on the Fox network on May 12, 2002. The entry was written and directed by executive producer Vince Gilligan, his thirtieth and last episode as writer for the series. The episode is a "monster-of-the-week" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X-Files. "Sunshine Days" earned a Nielsen household rating of 6.2, was viewed by 6.5 million households, and 10.4 million viewers in its initial broadcast. It received mixed reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the main suspect is a man with an unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability is the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File. The episode marked Gilligan's second directorial effort, after season seven's "Je Souhaite". The Brady Bunch house set featured in the episode was completely rebuilt. According to Anderson, people came "from all over Los Angeles" to get their pictures taken on the set. In addition, it contained several elaborate effects. Contents 1 Plot 2 Production 3 Broadcast and reception 4 Notes 5 Footnotes 6 Bibliography 7 External links Plot[edit] In Van Nuys, California, two men in their early twenties named Blake and Mike (Tyson Turrou and David Faustino) sneak into a house that Blake claims was where the comedy television series The Brady Bunch was filmed. Inside, they find a perfect recreation of the house from the series; Mike, unsettled, gets worried and leaves, but Blake plods on. Blake is subsequently sent hurtling through the air and smashes into Mike's car and dies. John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are called in to investigate. They interview Mike, who claims that Blake died after visiting "the Brady Bunch House". The three speak to the owner, Oliver Martin (Michael Emerson), but upon entering discover that the house looks nothing like the one featured in the teaser. Doggett, feeling something is not right, checks Martin's trashcan and finds asphalt shingles; earlier, on top of Mike's car, Doggett had found a piece of a shingle. He deduces that Blake was thrown through Martin's roof. Later that night, Mike looks into Martin's house and sees the whole Brady family eating dinner. He storms into the house, only to find that the family has disappeared. Suddenly, he is confronted by Martin, who tells him to leave. Mike refuses, and is thrown through the roof, only to be embedded in the yard. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) looks through various X-Files and discovers one about a young boy named Anthony Fogelman who possessed psychokinesis. She learns that Fogelman later changed his name to Oliver Martin. She meets with Dr. John Rietz (John Aylward), a parapsychologist who worked with the young Fogelman. Rietz claims that, despite being extremely lonely, Martin was not dangerous and that his power faded as he grew up. Reyes makes the connection that Fogelman changed his name to Oliver based on Cousin Oliver from The Brady Bunch. Scully notes that, in the show, Oliver was portrayed as a "jinx", and the three agents deduce that Fogelman must see himself as one, too. Doggett and Rietz decide to talk to Fogelman. Initially, he is apprehensive and nearly sends Doggett hurtling through the roof. It is revealed that Fogelman's powers are temperamental and sometimes he cannot control them, as was the case with the deaths of Mike and Blake. Reyes and Scully show up and convince him that his powers could positively impact the world. The agents take him to Washington, D.C., and demonstrate his powers to Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) by making him float in midair. Suddenly, however, Fogelman collapses. Scully later reports that his body is destroying itself because of his extreme power. Doggett realizes that Fogelman must stop using his powers; he notes that his power had faded earlier when Dr. Rietz was studying him as a boy. Doggett tells Rietz that his power faded because, with Rietz around, Fogelman did not feel lonely. Rietz visits Fogelman in the hospital, and the two rekindle their friendship, saving Fogelman's life. Scully laments the fact that there may not be any vindication for the X-Files, but that cases like Fogelman's might show that there is proof of "more important things."[2] Production[edit] "Sunshine Days" was Vince Gilligan's last writing and directing credit for The X-Files. "Sunshine Days" was written and directed by executive producer Vince Gilligan.[3] The episode marked Gilligan's second directorial effort, after season seven's "Je Souhaite".[4] Gilligan called the episode his "goodbye to the audience, and goodbye to the characters" because he realized that "would be the last time I'd ever be writing from them."[5] Prior to the show's 2016 revival, "Sunshine Days" was planned to be the final "monster-of-the-week" entry in the series; the show's original finale, "The Truth" would deal with the series' overarching alien colonization mythology.[6] The elaborate The Brady Bunch house set featured in the episode was built completely by the production crew, according to series co-star Gillian Anderson. She recounts the fact that, due to the original set having been long ago disassembled, people came "from all over Los Angeles" to get their pictures taken on the set.[5] Anderson, who was a fan of popular sitcoms made by Sherwood Schwartz, like Gilligan's Island and The Brady Bunch, called the experience "wild".[5] The scene in which Fogelman's house turns into an outside field was created via the technique of Chroma Keying. A shot of both The Brady Bunch house and an outside field were filmed. Then, the actors were filmed against a blue screen. A matte of the scenes was cut and the scenes were composited. Due to the fact that the shot was an extended scene, Paul Rabwin later noted that the effects were "a little tricky" to get right; Rabwin noted that the shots' mattes had to cover the "little strands of hair" on Anderson's head, because missing the strands is what "gives [the effect] away".[7] Broadcast and reception[edit] "Sunshine Days" originally aired on the Fox network on May 12, 2002, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on March 16, 2003.[3] The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately 6.5 million households[nb 1] and by 10.4 million viewers.[9] "Sunshine Days" earned a Nielsen household rating of 6.2, meaning that roughly 6.2 percent of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the episode. It was the forty-sixth most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending May 12.[8] Fox promoted the episode with the promise that it was the "most bizarre" episode of The X-Files to ever have been shown.[6] Critical reception to "Sunshine Days" was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine was critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode leading up to the heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode had little to do with the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files "Endgame" promotion strategy.[6] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a "C" grade. She sarcastically wrote, "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch."[10] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin.[11] The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" but shows that the most important "things to care about in life" are "humans".[11] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a "paean to medium of television itself" and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.[12] Notes[edit] ^ At the time of airing, the estimated number of households was 105.5 million.[8] Thus, 5.8 percent of 105.5 million is 6.1 million households.

This line was completed in 1902, to improve access of the MRs fast trains from London St Pancras via Derby to Manchester Central. The station was located 800 yards (730 m) south of Hazel Grove's centre, at the point where the line crossed over the Macclesfield and Buxton roads by means of two over-bridges, that are still in use.[2] There was a siding on the Up line towards New Mills for goods trains to recess into by reversing in off the main line. There was also a pair of sidings adjacent to the Down line and the station. These two sidings were also accessed by reversing back into them at the Cheadle Heath end. Nothing remains of the station platform or subway and only the footpath leading up from Buxton Road remains with original slatted wooden Midland Railway style fencing and gates, however some of this has now been lost due to a nearby car wash development. Hazel Grove (Midland) signalbox was located at the New Mills end of the station and lasted until closure in March 1977 when removed thereafter. Train service[edit] The station was underused. Very few trains stopped there as it was inconveniently located, so it was closed after only 15 years of use.

Fook Lam Moon means "fortune and blessings come to your home." The restaurant is often dubbed the Cafeteria for the Wealthy (Chinese: 富豪飯堂) by the media.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Signature dishes 3 Recognitions 4 References 5 External links History[edit] Born in 1908, founder Chui Fook Chuen became an apprentice at the age of 14 and quickly ascended as a house chef for an ex-bureaucrat of Qing Dynasty residing in Hong Kong. Following this position, he became the head chef for the prominent Ho Tung family. To fulfill his vision of becoming the true master chef for a wider clientele, Chui set up his own catering service "Fook Kee" in 1948. By offering dishes epitomizing the traditions of Cantonese cooking yet with a personal twist, Chui had since set the guiding principles and cemented the fundamentals which Fook Lam Moon uphold throughout the years. Fook Kee was an instant success, catering to the elites of Hong Kong and it was renamed as Fook Lam Moon in 1953, endowed with the meaning of "good fortune arriving at your door". Alongside Hong Kong's economic growth and evolution of the culinary industry, the first Fook Lam Moon Restaurant was opened in 1972 in Wanchai, Hong Kong. The Kowloon branch soon followed in 1977, opening in Tsimshatsui. Signature dishes[edit] Cooked whole abalone with duck feet and pomelo skin The restaurant's signature dishes are braised Japanese dried aged abalone with goose web, crispy fried chicken, roast suckling pig, baked stuffed crab meat and onion in shell and a variety of double-boiled soups. Recognitions[edit] The Wanchai and Tsim Sha Tsui branches of the restaurant were awarded two and one stars, respectively by the 2010 Michelin Guide,[3] following the one star rating in the guide's inaugural 2009 Hong Kong and Macau edition.[4] It was also listed at no. 18 and 19 on Asia's Top 20 Restaurants of the Miele Guide in the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 editions, respectively.[5][6] Fook Lam Moon was listed 48th in the Asia's Best 50 Restaurants in 2013; and ranked 19th, awarded "Highest Climber" in 2014.[7][8] References[edit] ^ Johnson, Susan (1991).

It was built in 1913. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Architecture 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References 6 External links History[edit] Its construction began in 1913 and concluded in 1916 as the Science Building. It was slightly affected by the 1918 San Fermín earthquake, it housed the administrative offices, the library and nine class rooms. As a result of a 1921 remodeling its new tower was added where later the clock was placed. Since then the rectory building is named the José de Diego building in honor of the campus's founder.[4] Architecture[edit] Although its constructive aesthetics presents a great eclecticism, is important to indicate the entrance of the great facade.[3] Follow the steps of the central staircase regular service, stand two columns - "dístilo" smooth shaft and reduced éntasis, with its pedestal, “basa”, toscano-romano capital marked “astragalo”.[3] This is the most estimable attention to aesthetic impact section. On the two abacus terminals holds a short frieze with the inscription in English the name of the school. Below is the date with the year 1916.[3] The construction is of two floors and irregular masonry.[3] It consists of two large horizontal lateral "masses" and a central rectangular.[3] In the middle section rises the Tower surrounded by balustrades and four campaniformes floreados pinnacles below of the cantilever roof supported by plates; inside lies the "Carillon" service, with external exits to their respective clocks.[3] The turret is covered with a coverage to four aspects; its Center highlights a "chapitelillo" tip.[3] The structure has many openings in administrative functionalism and be made at a time in which there was no air conditioning.[3] The structure began to be constructed in 1913 as Sciences building.

The number of (1-form) hyperplanes intersected by a vector equals the inner product.[1] In linear algebra, a one-form on a vector space is the same as a linear functional on the space. The usage of one-form in this context usually distinguishes the one-forms from higher-degree multilinear functionals on the space. For details, see linear functional. In differential geometry, a one-form on a differentiable manifold is a smooth section of the cotangent bundle. Equivalently, a one-form on a manifold M is a smooth mapping of the total space of the tangent bundle of M to R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } whose restriction to each fibre is a linear functional on the tangent space. Symbolically, α : T M → R , α x = α | T x M : T x M → R , {\displaystyle \alpha :TM\rightarrow {\mathbb {R} },\quad \alpha _{x}=\alpha |_{T_{x}M}:T_{x}M\rightarrow {\mathbb {R} },} where αx is linear. Often one-forms are described locally, particularly in local coordinates. In a local coordinate system, a one-form is a linear combination of the differentials of the coordinates: α x = f 1 ( x ) d x 1 + f 2 ( x ) d x 2 + ⋯ + f n ( x ) d x n , {\displaystyle \alpha _{x}=f_{1}(x)\,dx_{1}+f_{2}(x)\,dx_{2}+\cdots +f_{n}(x)\,dx_{n},} where the fi are smooth functions. From this perspective, a one-form has a covariant transformation law on passing from one coordinate system to another. Thus a one-form is an order 1 covariant tensor field. Contents 1 Examples 1.1 Applications 1.2 Differential 2 Differential of a function 3 See also 4 References Examples[edit] Applications[edit] Many real-world concepts can be described as one-forms: Indexing into a vector: The second element of a three-vector is given by the one-form [0, 1, 0]. That is, the second element of [x, y, z] is [0, 1, 0] · [x, y, z] = y. Mean: The mean element of an n-vector is given by the one-form [1/n, 1/n, ..., 1/n]. That is, mean ⁡ ( v ) = [ 1 / n , 1 / n , … , 1 / n ] ⋅ v . {\displaystyle \operatorname {mean} (v)=[1/n,1/n,\dots ,1/n]\cdot v.} Sampling: Sampling with a kernel can be considered a one-form, where the one-form is the kernel shifted to the appropriate location. Net present value of a net cash flow, R(t), is given by the one-form w(t) := (1 + i)−t where i is the discount rate. That is, N P V ( R ( t ) ) = ⟨ w , R ⟩ = ∫ t = 0 ∞ R ( t ) ( 1 + i ) t d t . {\displaystyle \mathrm {NPV} (R(t))=\langle w,R\rangle =\int _{t=0}^{\infty }{\frac {R(t)}{(1+i)^{t}}}\,dt.} Differential[edit] The most basic non-trivial differential one-form is the "change in angle" form d θ . {\displaystyle d\theta .} This is defined as the derivative of the angle "function" θ ( x , y ) {\displaystyle \theta (x,y)} (which is only defined up to an additive constant), which can be explicitly defined in terms of the atan2 function atan2 ⁡ ( y , x ) = arctan ⁡ ( y / x ) . {\displaystyle \operatorname {atan2} (y,x)=\operatorname {arctan} (y/x).} Taking the derivative yields the following formula for the total derivative: d θ = ∂ x ( atan2 ⁡ ( y , x ) ) d x + ∂ y ( atan2 ⁡ ( y , x ) ) d y = − y x 2 + y 2 d x + x x 2 + y 2 d y {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d\theta &=\partial _{x}\left(\operatorname {atan2} (y,x)\right)dx+\partial _{y}\left(\operatorname {atan2} (y,x)\right)dy\\&=-{\frac {y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}dx+{\frac {x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}dy\end{aligned}}} While the angle "function" cannot be continuously defined – the function atan2 is discontinuous along the negative y-axis – which reflects the fact that angle cannot be continuously defined, this derivative is continuously defined except at the origin, reflecting the fact that infinitesimal (and indeed local) changes in angle can be defined everywhere except the origin. Integrating this derivative along a path gives the total change in angle over the path, and integrating over a closed loop gives the winding number times 2π. In the language of differential geometry, this derivative is a one-form, and it is closed (its derivative is zero) but not exact (it is not the derivative of a 0-form, i.e., a function), and in fact it generates the first de Rham cohomology of the punctured plane. This is the most basic example of such a form, and it is fundamental in differential geometry. Differential of a function[edit] Main article: Differential of a function Let U ⊆ R {\displaystyle U\subseteq \mathbb {R} } be open (e.g., an interval ( a , b ) {\displaystyle (a,b)} ), and consider a differentiable function f : U → R {\displaystyle f:U\to \mathbb {R} } , with derivative f'. The differential df of f, at a point x 0 ∈ U {\displaystyle x_{0}\in U} , is defined as a certain linear map of the variable dx. Specifically, d f ( x 0 , ⋅ ) : d x ↦ f ′ ( x 0 ) d x {\displaystyle df(x_{0},\cdot ):dx\mapsto f'(x_{0})dx} . (The meaning of the symbol dx is thus revealed: it is simply an argument, or independent variable, of the linear function d f ( x 0 , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle df(x_{0},\cdot )} .) Hence the map x ↦ d f ( x ) {\displaystyle x\mapsto df(x)} sends each point x to a linear functional d f ( x , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle df(x,\cdot )} . This is the simplest example of a differential (one-)form. In terms of the de Rham cochain complex, one has an assignment from zero-forms (scalar functions) to one-forms i.e., f ↦ d f {\displaystyle f\mapsto df} .

The title was recognised as official by UK national TV network ITV for the purposes of their coverage of the UK wrestling scene[1] and by its listings magazine TVTimes in accompanying magazine feature coverage.[2] The title was defended in many promotions in Europe, and other versions of this one title also appeared in certain promotions. On August 25, 2001 the European Wrestling Union produced a European Heavyweight Championship tournament in Bochum, Germany, bringing in wrestlers some of whom claimed to already be the champion. This tournament saw these titles merge into one with Britain's Robbie Brookside confirming his claim as champion by defeating American "Five Star" Cory K in a championship decider. The title history below shows all the holders of the title in chronological order. However, there are instances where another wrestler has taken the role of champion, or claimed the title but no official title change was recorded (these are noted with "unknown title history", or other details.)

Along with Bram Cohen and three other venture capitalists, he is also on the board of governors of BitTorrent. He was instrumental in formulating BitTorrent's position on network neutrality, testifying before the FCC[1] as well as other worldwide telecom regulators[2] As CEO, he is credited with guiding BitTorrent through the 2008 financial crisis and growing the user base to over 170m users.[3] In 2012, BitTorrent expanded its mission under Klinker and broadened the product portfolio, introducing additional distributed applications like BitTorrent Sync, BitTorrent Bundles, Bleep,[4] and BitTorrent Live,[5] a linear broadcasting P2P protocol also invented by Bram Cohen. In 2014, BitTorrent announced Project Maelstrom,[6] a distributed web browser designed to power a new way for web content to be published, accessed and consumed. In April 2016, Klinker left BitTorrent to co-found Resilio Inc. [7] with a focus on applying BitTorrent technology to enterprise and IoT markets.

She served as an agent and advisor to James III "The Old Pretender" after the death of his father in 1701. Eleanor married in 1707 Eugène Marie de Béthisy, Marquis de Mézières, with whom she had seven children; their descendants include members of royal families throughout Europe.[1][2] Contents 1 Family 2 Jacobite activities 3 French Mississippi Company 4 References 5 Bibliography Family[edit] Eleanor Oglethorpe’s mother, also Eleanor Oglethorpe (née Wall), was an employee of the royal household during the reigns of Charles II and James II; she followed the latter to France, where he was exiled after the Glorious Revolution. Eleanor’s father, Theophilus Oglethorpe, also offered his service to James, but as a Protestant he was eventually sidelined. Theophilus and the elder Eleanor returned to Westbrook, their estate outside London, where they remained secretly and actively in the service of the Jacobite cause. Eleanor’s brother was James Edward Oglethorpe, who was raised at the family’s Westbrook estate. He later became a reformer in Parliament, the founder of the Georgia Colony, an officer in the army of Frederick the Great, and a prominent figure among London intellectuals in the Age of Johnson. James spent considerable time in Paris with sister Eleanor after his service with Frederick. Jacobite activities[edit] Eleanor and her sisters Molly and Fanny, all of whom married into French nobility, were strong supporters of the Jacobite cause. Eleanor’s Paris townhouse was a hub of Jacobite activity and a shelter for co-conspirators. When Henry St John, Lord Bolingbroke joined the cause, Eleanor and her husband associated with him in Paris. When Bolingbroke betrayed the cause, it was Eleanor who discovered his secret communication with authorities in London hidden in a house she owned used as the British ambassador’s residence.[3][4] At Westbrook, Eleanor’s mother and her older sister Anne were involved in coordinating Jacobite plots to overthrow George I, who succeeded Queen Anne. Evidence suggests that they ran a smuggling operation from their estate to raise funds for the cause. A secret tunnel from the town of Godalming to the house at Westbrook allowed for clandestine meetings. James III’s son, the Young Pretender, may have stayed there during a clandestine trip to England.[5] As a result of their Jacobite intrigues, myths developed around the Oglethorpes. In one instance, James III was rumored to be born an Oglethorpe boy, switched at birth when the actual Stuart heir died in 1689. In another, Eleanor’s sisters Anne and Fanny were variously called Queen Oglethorpe or Her Oglethorpean Majesty, in the belief one or the other was mistress to James III.[6] French Mississippi Company[edit] Eleanor Oglethorpe was an early backer of the French Mississippi Company, and recruited colonists to settle the lower Mississippi region. The enterprise was expected to accelerate settlement and trade in France’s Louisiana colony. Stock in the company was oversold, creating an investment bubble that burst in 1720. Eleanor and her husband sold her stock before the collapse, greatly increasing their wealth.[7] References[edit] ^ Ettinger 1968, pp. 19, 56, 68–78, 305. ^ Hill 1977, pp. 68–70. ^ Hill 1977, pp. 56–58. ^ Monod, Paul Kleber. “Dangerous Merchandise: Smuggling, Jacobitism, and Commercial Culture in Southeast England, 1690–1760”.

W.C.G. Armstrong; Honorary Colonel – Hon. Lt-Col. R.B. Bennett The 103rd Regiment (Calgary Rifles) was an infantry regiment of the Canadian Non-Permanent Active Militia, authorized at Calgary, Alberta, Canada, by General Order on 1 April 1910. Contents 1 History 2 War Service 3 Reorganization 4 Perpetuations 5 References History[edit] Field dress uniform for members of the 103rd Regiment, 1912. The 103rd Regiment was raised in Calgary as a militia unit. The first commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel W.C.G. Armstrong. The regiment was approved to train six companies of 50 men each, and later expanded to eight companies. The unit initially paraded at the former Calgary General Hospital building (today known as the Rundle Ruins) before being ordered to vacate in September 1910. The unit then moved into the former drill hall of the Canadian Mounted Rifles on Centre Street and 12th Avenue SE. In 1911 a new armoury was found, in a former German-Canadian club a block south of their former home at the General Hospital. After Mewata Armouries was completed during the First World War, the regiment moved its offices to that location. War Service[edit] At the outbreak of World War I the regiment was not mobilized but served as a recruiting depot to raise battalions for the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), the first being the 10th Battalion, CEF. The regiment also provided soldiers to man the internment camp at Castle Mountain.[1] These soldiers were also employed full time as part of the Active Militia.[2] A number of reinforcement battalions were commanded by former 103rd Regiment officers, including Lieutenant-Colonel William Armstrong (56th Battalion (Calgary), CEF) and Lieutenant-Colonel George Morfitt (137th (Calgary) Battalion, CEF). Reorganization[edit] The 103rd Regiment was reorganized into two regiments in 1920 (the Calgary Regiment and the Alberta Regiment), each of which was reorganized into two regiments a few years later. None of the new units adopted the rifle regiment traditions of the 103rd. Perpetuations[edit] One of the resulting four regiments (the North Alberta Regiment) was disbanded in the 1936 reorganization of the Militia, but three present-day regiments claim descent from the 103rd: the South Alberta Light Horse, the King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC) and the Calgary Highlanders. These regiments perpetuate the 10th, 31st, 50th, 56th, 82nd, 89th and 137th Battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force all of whom were either raised in, or contained soldiers from, Calgary.

It consisted of 22 episodes, each running approximately 25 minutes at length. The show was created and produced by director James Burrows and writers Glen and Les Charles, who previously worked on Taxi, another sitcom. Cheers was produced by Charles Burrows Charles Productions in association with Paramount Television. The concept and production design of the show were inspired by a public house in Boston, the Bull & Finch, which is now called Cheers Beacon Hill. When it was first broadcast, critics praised the series as intelligent, sophisticated, cleverly written, well-cast, and well-timed. However, the Nielsen ratings for its original runs were very low. Typically, low ratings result in a show's cancellation, but before the season finale aired, the network renewed it for another season. Reruns of season 1 scored higher ratings than its first airing and the series earned award recognitions, including five Emmy Award wins in 1983. In later years, this season has still elicited positive reviews and is currently available on DVD. Contents 1 Cast and characters 2 Episodes 3 Production 4 Broadcasts 5 Reception 6 Accolades 7 DVD release 8 Notes 8.1 References 8.1.1 Ratings notes 9 External links Cast and characters[edit] This season introduces six characters: Sam Malone (Ted Danson)—a bartender, bar owner, and retired baseball player. Before the series premiered, his baseball career took a toll due to his alcoholism, so he became an owner and a bartender of Cheers. Diane Chambers (Shelley Long)—a college-educated, sophisticated academic who is jilted by her fiancé and left without money or a job. Diane is hired by Sam as a waitress. She proves to be pretentious, annoys customers with her long-winded speeches, and becomes the butt of their jokes.[1] Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman)—a hard-working, "wisecracking, cynical waitress".[2] Carla is a divorced mother of her ex-husband Nick's four children and then becomes pregnant with his fifth child. Diane and Carla do not get along and often insult each other. Ernie "Coach" Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto)—an aging befuddled, "gravelly voiced"[2] retired coach and co-bartender. Coach is vulnerable to other people's exploits, which puts the bar at stake. Coach and Sam take care of each other as father and son figures whenever help is needed. Nevertheless, he listens to people's problems and solves them with advice and analysis. Norm Peterson (George Wendt)—a semi-employed accountant and bar regular. Whenever Norm enters the bar, people yell out his name, "Norm!" Diane, however, always calls him by his full first name, "Norman", after everyone has already said "Norm!" Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger)—a postal worker and bar regular. Cliff is often present in the bar and his words confuse or irritate other people. (The actor Ratzenberger in this season was never credited in the opening title sequence but in ending credits of almost every episode.[3] He would be billed in the opening sequence in subsequent seasons.) Throughout the season, supporting characters are explored while Sam and Diane flirt and reject each other. In the season finale, no longer resisting their temptations for each other, Sam and Diane passionately kiss. Episodes[edit] Main article: List of Cheers episodes Original air dates of episodes are not premiere dates for some areas of the United States. In those areas, episodes may have been broadcast at later dates,[4] but these dates are not included in this article. This series' original time slot was 9:00pm (Eastern)/8:00pm (Central). On January 1983, it was moved to 9:30pm ET/8:30pm CT due to lineup changes.[5] No.overallNo. inseasonTitle [6]Directed byWritten byOriginal air date [6]Rating/rank11"Give Me a Ring Sometime"James BurrowsGlen Charles & Les CharlesSeptember 30, 1982 (1982-09-30)9.6 / #60[rat1 1] Boston University student Diane and her fiancé, professor Sumner Sloane (Michael McGuire), plan to marry in Barbados. When he receives a telephone call from his ex-wife at the bar, Sumner returns to her and leaves an unsuspecting Diane behind. When she tries to change their flight reservations, Diane learns that Sumner and his ex-wife have already used the reservations. Owner and bartender Sam offers Diane a job as a waitress, which she initially refuses, but reluctantly accepts when she finds she can repeat verbatim a lengthy order from one table. 22"Sam's Women"James BurrowsEarl PomerantzOctober 7, 1982 (1982-10-07)14.7 / #49[rat1 2]/ 19 share[rat1 3] Diane mocks Sam for flirting with Brandee (Angela Aames), a less-than-bright but flirtatious blonde. Sam and Diane argue about Sam's serial dating of attractive yet unintelligent women, while impatient Brandee leaves the bar with someone else, much to Diane's delight. Later, he uses his ex-wife Debra (Donna McKechnie) as a dating charade, which becomes foiled when Diane sees an opera pamphlet from two years ago. Humiliated, Sam blames Diane for making him discontent with his womanizing ways, and assures her that he will not give up on winning an intelligent woman. Sam wins the argument by tricking Diane to fall for him after he compliments her eyes resembling a color of the sky that he saw at a ski resort, although Diane quickly denies her potential affection for him. A former customer, Leo (Donnelly Rhodes), comes to the bar seeking advice from Gus, the former owner. When Leo hears that Gus is dead, he reluctantly turns to Coach for help. Leo's son Ron has a fiancé Rick, an African-American man. Coach advises Leo to simply abandon Ron if he is "unhappy about it". However, Leo mistakes Coach's advice for deliberate reverse-psychology and leaves the bar as an accepting father. According to Bjorklund's book about the series, Gus from the 11th season episode, "The Last Picture Show" (1993), may not be the deceased former owner of the same name.[7] In some syndicated prints, mention of Sam's past marriage is omitted. 33"The Tortelli Tort"James BurrowsTom ReederOctober 14, 1982 (1982-10-14)11.1 / #63[rat1 4] Carla attacks Big Eddie (Ron Karabatsos) for insulting the Boston Red Sox, including Sam. Confronted with a lawsuit threatening either Carla's losing her job or Sam's losing the bar, Carla tries to placate the issue by seeing the anger management counselor, Dr. Graham (Stephen Keep). When Big Eddie next encounters Carla in the bar, he is both frustrated and impressed by her self-control, and ultimately drops the lawsuit against Sam and Cheers. A tough patron who plays for the Boston Bruins (Rex Ryon) has overheard Eddie's insulting comments about his sports team, and escorts Eddie from the bar—apparently to beat up Big Eddie, much to everybody's pleasure. However, Carla still apparently carries anger when she rudely throws the beer mug to a customer from the pool table room. Jon Miller, a then-announcer for the Boston Red Sox, provides the play-by-play of the game on the television in the opening scene.[8] 44"Sam at Eleven"James BurrowsGlen Charles & Les CharlesOctober 21, 1982 (1982-10-21)11.1 / #62[rat1 5] Sportscaster Dave Richards (Fred Dryer) wants to interview Sam because no better-known celebrities are available. Later, Dave shatters Sam's second bid for fame by leaving in the middle of the interview for a now-available celebrity. In the billiard room, Diane tries to convince Sam to take pride in his past but enjoy the present, which backfires when Sam tries to kiss Diane. Diane flips him onto the pool table, revealing her unexpected knowledge of judo. To forgive Sam, she expresses further interest in Sam's baseball reminiscences. A con artist, Harry "the Hat" Gittes (Harry Anderson), makes his first appearance, conning people throughout the episode. Though credited, John Ratzenberger (as Cliff) does not appear in this episode. This is the only Cheers episode in which Cliff does not appear. 55"Coach's Daughter"James BurrowsKen EstinOctober 28, 1982 (1982-10-28)11.0 / #66[rat1 6] Coach's daughter Lisa (Allyce Beasley) arrives with her fiancé Roy (Philip Charles MacKenzie), who is rude and obnoxious. Coach tries to keep silent about his manner to make her happy, but Roy continues to insult others. In the office, Coach tells Lisa that she is too good for the likes of Roy. Lisa reluctantly agrees with her father and says that she will marry Roy only because she is ashamed of her own beauty, which resembles her mother's. However, Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, like her mother. Feeling more self-confident, Lisa tells Roy off and ends their relationship and prepares to celebrate her freedom with her father. Diane draws sketches of people, but her efforts show no resemblance to their subjects. 66"Any Friend of Diane's"James BurrowsKen Levine and David IsaacsNovember 4, 1982 (1982-11-04)12.4 / #62[rat1 7] Diane's university friend Rebecca Prout (Julia Duffy) tells her that she has dumped her fiancé Elliott, who has been unfaithful to her. In desperation, Rebecca wants to have sex with Sam. Diane tries to stop them but is unsuccessful, and Sam and Rebecca leave the bar. Later, Sam returns and tells Diane that nothing happened, and that he found Rebecca "boring, depressing, [and] long-winded," much to Diane's relief. However, Rebecca returns in tears and tells Diane that Sam abandoned and neglected her, which angers Diane. In response, Diane and Sam pretend to be in a relationship, which boosts Rebecca's self-esteem over the rejection, much to their relief. In an attempt to impress one of his clients[9] (Macon McCalman), Norm initially limits himself to one beer to avoid being seen as a beer-loving barfly. However, his boss wants to drink more beers. Coach initially refuses to break Norm's promise but then lets Norm order a pitcher full of beer instead. 77"Friends, Romans, Accountants"James BurrowsKen Levine and David IsaacsNovember 11, 1982 (1982-11-11)13.6 / #50[rat1 8] Accountant Norm Peterson chooses the toga theme, requested by Diane, and Cheers for the annual office party as an effort to please his boss Herbert Sawyer (James Read). When Norm arrives wearing a toga, the party turns out to be moribund and without a mood for togas, leaving Norm humiliated, disappointed, and the only person wearing a toga. Desperate, Norm begs Diane to seduce his boss, but she refuses until Herbert turns out to be attractive and about the same age as Diane. Later, in the billiard room, Herbert tries to seduce Diane, but when she rejects his advances without success, he begins attempting to sexually assault her. Suddenly, Norm sees Sawyer attacking Diane and saves her by grabbing Herbert, who fires Norm. Although Norm is unhappy about losing his job, everyone finds out that Norm stood up to Herbert, causing everyone to celebrate. 88"Truce or Consequences"James BurrowsKen Levine and David IsaacsNovember 18, 1982 (1982-11-18)11.9 / #63[rat1 9] Sam intervenes in a conflict between Diane and Carla, who cannot abide each other. He warns them about losing their jobs and orders them to patch things up. After Sam leaves the bar, Carla confesses to Diane that Gino, one of her children, is Sam's child, and commands Diane to keep this a secret. The next day, Diane inadvertently reveals Carla's secret to Coach. When Coach tells her that Sam and Carla have only known each other for five years and Gino is seven and a half, Carla's confession is shown to be a lie. When another conflict between the two waitresses ensues, Sam drags them into the office to settle the matter. When they tell Sam the whole situation, and Carla shows a picture of Gino, all of them burst into laughter. Carla and Diane make a truce with a handshake. 99"Coach Returns to Action"James BurrowsEarl PomerantzNovember 25, 1982 (1982-11-25)10.0 / #69[rat1 10] The weather in Boston is very cold. Coach has a crush on his new neighbor Nina (Murphy Cross), who comes into the bar because the heater in her apartment is not working, but Coach is too shy to ask her out. When Coach has almost given up asking Nina out, Diane and Carla cheer him up by telling him that, even old in age, he is still attractive to woman. Nina gets a telephone call telling her that her heater is fixed. As she is about to leave, Coach finally asks Nina out, but Nina kindly rejects his offer. Coach purposely falls down the stairs and feigns injury to win her over, so Nina helps his "injuries" in her apartment. Carla fixes plumbing in the men's restroom.

Kevin mistakes Diane's positive compliments about his physique as flirtation and tries to kiss her, upsetting Diane. Feeling bad about it, Kevin figures that he is unfit for the monastery and would rather go decadent. Then Kevin puts a coin in the coin-operated piano that has not worked for twenty years. When it "miraculously" works, he believes that he has healed the piano and will achieve a priesthood. After Kevin leaves, Coach reveals that he fixed the piano "a couple days ago".

Specials No.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air dateS01"Super Bowl XVII Pregame segment"[13][14]James BurrowsKen Levine and David IsaacsJanuary 30, 1983 (1983-01-30) A short sketch, running under three minutes. The gang is assembled at Cheers to watch the Super Bowl. While Diane mocks the game, they all meet sportscaster Pete Axthelm. Aired as part of 1983's Super Bowl pre-game show. Other NBC shows Remington Steele, Taxi, and The A-Team also produced sketches for that year's Super Bowl pre-game. This short sketch is not available on home video. Nicholas Colasanto does not appear in this sketch. S02"Uncle Sam Malone"[15]James BurrowsRalph Phillips additional material: Brian H. Sato and Steven AmayaTBA Cliff is about to go on vacation to Tahiti, paid for by his investment in U.S. Savings Bonds. Sam, Cliff and Norm convince Diane, Carla, and Coach to also invest in bonds. "Uncle Sam Malone" is presented as a complete (if short) episode of Cheers, including opening theme and closing credits, and was produced by the United States Department of Treasury to promote sales of U.S. Savings Bonds. The abbreviated episode runs 13 minutes, and stars the whole main cast of Cheers, in character. Production[edit] Exterior (left) and interior of the Bull & Finch Pub, now Cheers Beacon Hill, that inspired the show's bar stage set. Director James Burrows observed that this series is intended to be about the bar, where anybody comes in for any reason, not just drinks.[2] The show was originally set in a hotel, a setting inspired by Fawlty Towers, Burrows's favorite British sitcom.[16] The producers narrowed the setting down to a hotel bar,[17] but later evolved it into a neighborhood bar in Boston,[2] according to Glen Charles, "because it was more cozy".[18] The "athletic element" was added to the bar because the show's creators, Burrows and Charles brothers (Glen and Les) were sports fans.[18] The show's bar setting was inspired by the Bull & Finch Pub in Boston. It was not filmed in the pub, but on the Stage 25 lot of Paramount Studios with the set decoration of Cheers.[17] The Bull & Finch Pub was later renamed Cheers Beacon Hill.[19] The entire season is set exclusively in the bar, its office, the bathroom, and the billiard room; no locations outside the bar were used until Diane Chambers' apartment is seen in the second season.[20] George WendtJohn RatzenbergerTheir respective roles (Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin) were not envisioned until they auditioned for a minor, originally scripted role. In the pilot episode's original script, there were only four principal characters: Sam Malone, Diane Chambers, Carla Tortelli, and Ernie "Coach" Pantusso. Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin were absent from the original script. George Wendt and John Ratzenberger had auditioned for the role of George, a character who would have been included in the ending scene of the pilot episode with just one line, "Beer."[21][22] Wendt was cast as George, who evolved into Norm Peterson,[23] while a know-it-all character Cliff Clavin was added at Ratzenberger's suggestion.[22] Therefore, influenced by the casting of Wendt and Ratzenberger, the pilot script was revised before production began on the show. Wendt became part of the program's regular cast and continued until it ended.[24] Ratzenberger was credited in almost every episode for his recurring appearances in season 1,[3] and he became part of the regular cast in the following season.[25] Sam Malone was supposed to be an ex-wide receiver for the New England Patriots football team,[26] but Danson's casting led the program's writers to change Sam's former sporting role into a former relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox baseball team.[26][27][28] Nicholas Colasanto, director and actor who appeared in the 1980 film Raging Bull,[29] was cast as Coach.[2] About 1,000 actors who were not widely known were auditioned for these characters,[2] and Stephen Kolzak[24] was in charge of casting.[30] According to Ted Danson, Perlman was the first actor to be hired for the show[31] and was cast as Carla.[2] Perlman had previously appeared in Taxi as the wife (ex-wife during the show's final season) of Louie de Palma, played by her husband Danny DeVito.[2] Danson and Long were cast as a romantic duo.[32] Rhea Perlman was first to be cast.[31] Also, she was pregnant during the whole season, as well as her character Carla.[10] At the time the show was being filmed, Rhea Perlman was pregnant. She told the producers during filming of the third of fourth episode (produced or aired), and the episodes were filmed out of sequence to allow Perlman to hide her pregnancy with a tray until the episode "Father Knows Last", after which Perlman's pregnancy was assimilated into her character Carla Tortelli, who was pregnant with her ex-husband Nick's child for the rest of the season. Perlman's daughter Lucy was born on March 12, 1983.[10] Drinks and snacks in the show were neither alcoholic nor edible. The scotch was made from water, the beer was non-alcoholic and was made out of "less lingering ingredients" with salt to produce a foam, and the cheese puffs were not real. The bathroom did not have toilets and sinks. Canned laughter was not used on the show; live audience reactions were recorded on film.[33] From episode 13, each episode was preceded with the announcement, "Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience", and this continued during the remainder of the show's run.[34] NBC praised the show when the network was given test experiments and ordered initial thirteen episodes to be produced.[35] The series' Nielsen ratings were low during this season, and the network tried to attract more viewers to the series. One episode was experimentally shot on videotape to lower production costs, but the producers were not satisfied with the results and continued to shoot the show on film.[36] NBC also produced a scripted Super Bowl sketch with sportscaster Pete Axthelm, which was broadcast during the Super Bowl pre-game segment on January 30, 1983,[13][14] along with sketches for other NBC shows, including The A-Team.[13] After efforts to improve the ratings failed, NBC approved production of nine more episodes,[35] and renewed the series for the next season.[37] Before "Where Everybody Knows Your Name", written by Gary Portnoy and Judy Hart Angelo became the show's theme song, Cheers' producers rejected two of Portnoy's and Hart Angelo's songs. The songwriters had collaborated to provide music for Preppies an unsuccessful Broadway musical. When told they could not appropriate "People Like Us", Preppies's opening song, the pair wrote My Kind of People, intended to satirize "the lifestyle of old decadent old-money WASPs," but, to meet producers' demands, they rewrote the lyrics to be about "likeable losers" in a Boston bar. The show's producers rejected this song, as well as later songs that Portnoy and Angelo wrote. When Portnoy and Hart Angelo heard that NBC had commissioned thirteen episodes, they created "Where Everybody Knows Your Name", and rewrote the lyrics.[38] Broadcasts[edit] Cheers was an easy call. That is just so well done that we should be sent to jail for cancelling it.[39] - Grant Tinker, NBC chairman and chief executive Cheers was first broadcast at 9:00pm (Eastern) / 8:00pm (Central) on Thursday during fall 1982, which later became NBC's Must See TV, which followed the hour-long musical series Fame and preceded another half-hour sitcom Taxi, and hour-long crime series Hill Street Blues.[5] Cheers was scheduled against CBS's Simon & Simon and ABC's Too Close for Comfort.[40] Because of poor Nielsen ratings, NBC changes its Thursday schedule. Critically acclaimed comedy Taxi moved to Saturdays; critically panned Gimme a Break! moved to Thursdays at 9pm ET/8pm CT and Cheers was moved to the 9:30pm ET/8:30pm CT slot,[5] still competing against Simon & Simon and ABC's It Takes Two.[41] Fame and Hill Street Blues remained in the same time slot.[5] The overall performance of the season was 74th place out of "[ninety-nine] regularly scheduled shows".[42] Despite low ratings and unsuccessful attempts to improve them, NBC renewed Cheers for a second season, which it announced on March 1983.[37] During mid-1983, reruns of the show's first season scored high ratings, most episodes reaching the top 20.[43] "No Contest" was rerun on July 14, 1983, at 9:30pm ET/8:30pm CT[44] and tied with Remington Steele in 12th place out of 65 programs in the ratings week of July 11, 1983.[45] "Let Me Count the Ways" was rerun on May 26, 1983,[46] and came 19th out of 63 programs with a 17.4 rating.[47] "The Boys in the Bar" aired again on July 28, 1983,[48] and scored a 12.8 rating and 23 share.[49] In Sydney, Australia, the first season aired on Sundays on Network Ten from November 1983[50] to April 8, 1984.[51] Reception[edit] During the first broadcast of its first season in 1982–1983, Cheers received positive reviews.[52] Rick Sherwood called it "ever-charming".[53] Montreal critic Mike Boone from The Gazette called it "unpredictable" and the supporting characters "splendid".[54] Fred Rothenberg of the Associated Press called it the "funniest, most adult comedy on TV".[55] Later reviews were more positive. Jason Bovberg from DVD Talk praised season 1's writing quality above its "odd assortment of [characters]" and gave its content four and a half stars out of five.[56] Steve Butts from IGN called this season "some of the best comedy writing and acting seen on television", praised the cast's performances, and gave it nine out of ten points.[57] Another IGN critic Cliff Wheatley called the pilot "Give Me a Ring Sometime" the ninth best Cheers episode and another episode "Truth or Consequences" fifth.[58] Stephen Tropiano from PopMatters called it "fresh and very funny", even for a very old show, but said that some situations seem "forced", especially for customers with no connections to main characters. He also wrote that the show has "witty dialogue, talented ensemble, and a premise reminiscent of 1930s screwball comedies", which compared with the most popular sitcoms of the 1970s—Three’s Company, Laverne and Shirley, and The Love Boat—"Cheers was a welcome change of pace.".[59] Michael Speier from Variety magazine called it "clever and touching" with "fresh" stories and praised chemistry between Ted Danson and Shelley Long.[60] Jonathan Boudreaux from the website TVDVDReviews.com wrote, "[w]hile the episodes are often outrageously funny, the show's humor is character-based. The laughs arrive from the personalities and foibles of the group rather than from wacky situations." He also wrote, "Cheers is probably one of the best TV series of all time."[61] Elizabeth Skipper from DVD Verdict rated the story 90 percent and acting 95 percent and wrote, "[t]here's nothing terribly unique about the series; it's ... fueled by the sexual tension between the two leads and fanned by a well-rounded supporting cast, a portrayal of the attempts of a downtown boy to win over an uptown girl—it's all been done before."[62] Matt Brighton from Blu-ray Authority called the season's writing and directing "clever" and was "impressed at how this show has stood the test of time."[63] TV Guide called "The Tortelli Tort" a "classic episode".[64] Accolades[edit] We could have no better relationship with a network.[65] - Les Charles at the 1983 Emmy Awards The first season of Cheers received thirteen nominations for the Primetime Emmy Awards in 1983. It won five Emmy Awards, including an Outstanding Comedy Series. All the main cast except George Wendt, and John Ratzenberger, who was not part of the main cast, were nominated for, respectively, their own leading and supporting roles.[66] Shelley Long won the award for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series". Glen and Les Charles won an Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series award for the pilot episode "Give Me a Ring Sometime". Episodes "The Boys in the Bar" and "Diane's Perfect Date" were nominated for the same category. James Castle and Bruce Bryant won an Outstanding Individual Achievement of Graphic Design and Title Sequences for "Showdown, Part One". James Burrows won an Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series award for "Showdown, Part Two". The program's theme song, "Where Everybody Knows Your Name", was nominated for an Outstanding Achievement in Music and Lyrics award, but did not win.[66] The Television Critics Association voted Cheers the Best New Series of 1982–1983.[67][68] The episodes "Give Me a Ring Sometime" and "The Boys in the Bar" won the Episodic Comedy category in the 36th Annual Writers Guild of America Awards in 1984.[69] "The Spy Who Came In for a Cold One",[70] and "Let Me Count the Ways" were nominated for the same award.[71] James Burrows won the Comedy Series category of the 36th Annual Directors Guild of America Award (DGA) for "Showdown, Part Two" in 1984;[72] he was DGA-nominated for "Sam at Eleven" but did not win in 1983.[73] On Saturday, January 29, 1983, Cheers won the Golden Globe Award for Best Musical or Comedy Television Series of 1982, and Shelley Long won a Golden Globe Award as the Best Supporting Actress in Television.[74] Cheers did not win any Golden Globes for categories related to comedy television of 1983 at the 1984 ceremony.[75] On Thursday, March 17, 1983, Cheers won the Favorite New Television Comedy Program award at the 9th Annual People's Choice Awards.[76][77] DVD release[edit] Season 1 of Cheers was released on Region 1 DVD on May 20, 2003, twenty years after its season finale and ten years after the series finale, "One for the Road", were broadcast on television.[60][78] Elizabeth Skipper of DVD Verdict rated video quality 80 percent and the sound quality 65 percent, but called the menu settings "ugly" and uninspiring, and the special features "lackluster" and consisting mostly of compilation clips of this season.[62] Jonathan Boudreaux of TVDVDreviews.com found the video "clear and sharp", and found the sound quality similar to that of the television broadcast.[61] Cheers: The Complete First Season Set Details[78] Special Features[78] 22 episodes 4-disc set 1:33:1 aspect ratio English - Stereo Closed captioning (Region 1) Subtitles: Danish, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish (Region 2) Setting The Bar: A Conversation with Ted Danson Love at First Fight: Opposites Distract Coach Ernie Pantusso's Rules of the Game I'll Drink to That: Stormin' Norm-isms "It's a Little Known Fact..."

CenturyCategorySerifClassificationDidone, Scotch ModernDesigner(s)Linn Boyd and Morris Fuller BentonFoundryAmerican Type FoundersDate released1894–1923VariationsCentury Expanded, Century Schoolbook, Century Old Style, Century CatalogueShown hereCentury Schoolbook Century is a family of serif type faces particularly intended for body text. The family originates from a first design, Century Roman cut by American Type Founders designer Linn Boyd Benton in 1894 for master printer Theodore Low De Vinne, for use in The Century Magazine.[1] ATF rapidly expanded it into a very large family, first by Linn Boyd and later by his son Morris. Century is based on the "Scotch" genre, a style of type of British origin which had been popular in the United States from the early nineteenth century and is part of the "Didone" genre of type popular through the entire nineteenth century.[2][3] Its design emphasizes crispness and elegance, with strokes ending in fine tapers, ball terminals and crisp, finely pointed serifs. However, compared to many earlier typefaces in the genre, stroke contrast is quite low, creating a less sharp and highly readable structure.[4] With ATF no longer operating, a wide variety of variants and revivals with varying features and quality are available. Despite originating in the nineteenth century, use of the typeface remains strong for periodicals, textbooks, and literature. The Supreme Court of the United States requires that briefs be typeset in Century family type.[5] According to Charles Shaw, "The rugged simplicity of the Century family of types has made it an enduring favorite of American typographers for almost one hundred years. Beginning as foundry type, Century has withstood a series of technical transformations into Linotype, Monotype, Ludlow, phototype, transfer type, digital type, and Xerox-like 'toner type'."[6] Contents 1 Distinctive characteristics 2 Variations 2.1 Century Roman 2.2 Century 2.2.1 Hot metal copies 2.2.2 Cold type copies 2.2.3 Digital variants 2.3 Century Oldstyle 2.3.1 Hot metal copies 2.3.2 Cold type copies 2.4 Century Catalogue 2.5 Century Schoolbook 2.5.1 Hot metal copies 2.5.2 Cold type copies 2.5.3 Digital copies 2.5.4 Digital variants 2.5.5 Century Schoolbook Infant 2.5.6 Cyrillic adaptations 2.6 Century Nova 3 Related digital revivals 4 See also 5 References 6 Further reading Distinctive characteristics[edit] Century types from the ATF specimen book, 1912. Century Schoolbook had not yet been released at this time. Characteristics of this typeface are: lower case: curl ending in a ball terminal on top of letter c. Ball terminal on hook of f, ear of g, and tail of j. upper case: curled tail on the capital R and reflexive curled tail on the capital Q. Prominent top spur on capital C. figures: curl ending in a ball terminal on both tails of 3, and on single tail of 2, 5, 6 and 9. Variations[edit] Century Roman[edit] Century RomanCategorySerifClassificationModernDesigner(s)Linn Boyd BentonCommissioned byTheodore Low De Vinne for the Century MagazineFoundryAmerican Type FoundersDate created1894Date releasedNovember, 1895 issue of Century Magazine Theodore Low De Vinne, the printer of Century Magazine, wanted a more legible typeface for the magazine. He commissioned his friend Linn Boyd Benton from the newly formed American Type Founders to devise such a face. Over the course of the nineteenth century, largely because of the influence of Bodoni, common printing fonts had become thin, making a weak impression on the page. De Vinne and fellow printer William Morris decried this "growing effeminacy" and called for a reversion to sturdier faces.[6] The face L.B. Benton produced, Century Roman, had a larger x-height than most faces and thicker hair-lines than was common, giving the appearance of a condensed face because De Vinne believed this to be more legible.[7] This was made only in foundry type and later an accompanying face of normal width was produced by L.B. Benton, called variously Century Broad Face or Century No. 2.[8] Despite being the original member of the Century family, it is not popular compared to the later members of the family with more normal proportions. Century[edit] CenturyCategorySerifClassificationModernDesigner(s)Morris Fuller BentonCommissioned byAmerican Type FoundersFoundryAmerican Type FoundersDate created1900Date released1900–1910Re-issuing foundriesBarnhart Brothers & Spindler, Linotype, Intertype, Monotype, LudlowDesign based onCentury Roman + Bruce #16 RomanAlso known asCentury Expanded With the merging of twenty-three foundries into American Type Founders in 1892, Linn Boyd Benton's son, Morris Fuller Benton, was given the task of consolidating and purging the faces of these manufacturers into a coherent selection. Following this, he was given the task of adapting Century No. 2 to meet the Typographical Union standards of the time. Records now in the Smithsonian show that M.F. Benton not only re-designed his father's face, but did so with reference to #16 Roman of the Bruce Type Foundry which A.T.F. had recently acquired. (And which, probably not coincidentally, had been introduced in the Bruce Foundry catalog of 1877 which had been printed by De Vinne.)[6] The result was Century Expanded, which proved hugely successful. By 1912 the A.T.F. catalog no longer offered the original Century Roman, while displaying 64 pages of samples of other members of the Century family.[9] Following the successful introduction of this type, M.F. Benton embarked upon the creation of the first planned type family, and it is this conception of "type families" that is probably Benton's single greatest achievement. The faces were issued over a period of ten years, all of which were designed by Benton and issued by A.T.F.:[8] Century Expanded (1900) Century Italic + Century Bold (1905) Century Bold Condensed (1909) Century Bold Extended (1910) Hot metal copies[edit] Century proved to be hugely popular and was either licensed or copied by all the makers of mechanical composition machines, including Linotype, Intertype, and Monotype. Barnhart Brothers & Spindler called their version Century Roman, while Ludlow called their 1953 version Century Modern. A few variants were even added:[8] Century Bold Condensed Italic (1938, Sol Hess, Monotype) Century Extra Bold Extended (Linotype), designed for use in newspaper and magazine headlines. Cold type copies[edit] Century's popularity and usefulness continued right through the cold type era and was made available for photocomposition by all the leading producers under the following names:[10] Century Expanded – Autologic, Berthold, Dymo, Harris, Mergenthaler, Monotype, Varityper. Century X – Alphatype Century Light – Compugraphic Censtar Expanded – Star/Photon Cambridge Expanded – Graphic Systems Inc. Digi-Antiqua – Hell AG ITC Century - ITC: a less faithful version with increased x-height, but extremely popular, has also been digitised. A Century typeface was also available for the IBM Selectric Composer. Digital variants[edit] A digital version named Benton Modern Text was first prepared by Font Bureau for the Boston Globe and the Detroit Free Press. It was designed by Tobias Frere-Jones and is based on Century Expanded, but the accompanying italic and bold are based upon Century Schoolbook and were designed by Richard Lipton and Christian Schwartz. Benton Modern was released in two optical sizes: text for general use and display for large text sizes.[11] Font Bureau had already digitised as a separate project Century Bold Condensed on its own, intending it particularly for newspaper headlines.[12] Century Oldstyle[edit] Century OldstyleCategorySerifClassificationOld StyleDesigner(s)Morris Fuller BentonCommissioned byAmerican Type FoundersFoundryAmerican Type FoundersDate created1909Date released1909–1915Re-issuing foundriesLinotype, Intertype, MonotypeDesign based onCentury Roman + CaslonAlso known asOld Style No. 9 (Linotype) Century Oldstyle was released at a time when heavier faces with bracketed serifs were returning to vogue. The faces, all of which were designed by Benton and issued by A.T.F., were issued over a period of six years.[8] Century Oldstyle is Linn Boyd Benton's and Morris Fuller Benton's renovation of Phemister's Miller & Richard Old Style for ATF (also known as Bookman Oldstyle) forty-five years later, using the Century name for marketing purposes.[13] Despite the name it is not purely an old-style serif font (the type of metal type used before around 1750), but retains many more modern characteristics such as its curling capital Q. Century Oldstyle + italic + bold (1909) Century Oldstyle Bold Italic (1910) Century Oldstyle Bold Condensed (1915) Hot metal copies[edit] Century Oldstyle was not as popular as its predecessor, but the roman and italic were copied by Linotype, Intertype, and Monotype.[8] Cold type copies[edit] As oldstyle faces gained in popularity during the photo-comp era, Century Oldstyle was copied more widely then than during the hot type era. Copies were made under following names:[10] Century Oldstyle – Alphatype, Berthold, Harris, Mergenthaler Cambridge Oldstyle – Graphic Systems Inc.

Benton and released by A.T.F. in 1917.[8] As far as is known, Century Catalogue was never copied by other foundries, for machine composition, or as cold type. Raph Levien has produced a "nearly complete" (but largely abandoned for the past decade) digitization of Century Catalogue under the terms of the Open Font License.[14] Century Schoolbook[edit] Century SchoolbookCategorySerifClassificationTransitionalDesigner(s)Morris Fuller BentonCommissioned byGinn & CompanyFoundryAmerican Type FoundersDate created1918Date released1918–1923Re-issuing foundriesLinotype, Intertype, Monotype, LudlowDesign based onCentury ExpandedAlso known asCentury Modern (Ludlow) Century Schoolbook is a transitional serif typeface designed by Morris Fuller Benton in 1919 for the American Type Founders (ATF) at the request of Ginn & Co., a textbook publisher, which wanted an especially easy-to-read face for textbooks. Century Schoolbook has elements similar to the Didone classification. Century Schoolbook is based on the earlier Century Roman. Century Schoolbook is familiar to many in North America as being the typeface with which many first learned to read. Morris Fuller Benton utilized research done by Clark University that showed young readers more quickly identified letterforms with contrasting weight, but with the lighter strokes maintaining presence. Tests also showed the importance of maintaining counter-form (the white space around the black letterform) in recognizing the face at smaller sizes.[6] In designing Century Schoolbook, M. F. Benton increased the x-height, the stroke width, and overall letterspacing. The faces were issued over a period of five years, all of which were designed by Benton and issued by A.T.F.:[8] Century Schoolbook (1918) Century Schoolbook Italic (1921) Century Schoolbook Bold (1923) A final member of the Century family was an oldstyle version called Schoolbook Oldstyle begun in 1920 and released in 1926, an italic following in 1928. This never achieved the popularity of its sister faces, was never adapted for machine composition (much less cold type or digital). and was eventually withdrawn. Hot metal copies[edit] Another immensely popular face for A.T.F. and Benton, Century Schoolbook was either licensed or copied by all the makers of mechanical composition machines, including Linotype, Intertype, Monotype, and Ludlow. One variant, Century Schoolbook Bold Italic was even added by Intertype.[8] Linotype also commissioned Rudolph Ruzicka to design Primer, which was intended to compete directly with Century Schoolbook for the text-book market. Cold type copies[edit] The popularity of Century Schoolbook outstripped that of Century in the cold type era, and it was offered by all manufacturers under the following names:[10] Century Schoolbook – Autologic, Berthold, Dymo, Harris, Mergenthaler, Monotype, MGD Graphic Systems. Century Text – Alphatype Century Textbook – Compugraphic Censtar School – Star/Photon Cambridge Schoolbook – Graphic Systems Inc. Schoolbook – Varityper Digital copies[edit] The most common digital version is Monotype's, bundled with many Microsoft products.[15] There are also versions of New Century Schoolbook by URW++, DTP Types, Bitstream, Elsner+Flake and others.[16] A very limited set of styles digitised by URW++ has been released as open-source software as part of the Ghostscript project in type 1 format.[17] TeX Gyre Schola is an adaptation of the URW release by a Polish group. Including a Cyrillic version and small caps, it is perhaps the most complete open-source digitisation of the Century family.[18] Confusingly, the Monotype version offered with Microsoft products is also called just 'Century', perhaps for backwards compatibility reasons from the period when file names had to be short. Modern Microsoft products include both this 'Century' (in roman style only but with Cyrillic characters) and the same design as 'Century Schoolbook', only the latter including the whole family with bold and italics.[19] Digital variants[edit] Grad is a variant by Phil Martin (digitized by Mark Simonson) based on the original ATF Century Schoolbook. It is an extensive digitisation with text figures and small caps, also adding unusual features such as asymmetric serifs.[20] Century Schoolbook Infant[edit] This is a single-story version of the typeface that is used to help children learn to read. It is very rare, but it can be found in the Spot books by Eric Hill. As of 2020, a version of it can be purchased from DTP Types Limited. Cyrillic adaptations[edit] The Century Schoolbook typeface was also adapted by Soviet typographies. The first Cyrillic adaptation, named Pioner (Russian for "pioneer"), was designed in 1939, and later in 1961 the second adaptation was made in the scientific research institute (NII) "Poligrafmash". The latter version acquired the name Shkol'naya (Russian for "of school") and since then it has been the standard and most widely used typeface for children publications and for school textbooks in the Soviet Union and later in Russia.[21] Century Nova[edit] Century Nova + Italic (1964) was designed by Charles E. Hughes with the stipulation from A.T.F. that it must be equally suited for both letterpress (hot type) and offset (cold type) reproduction.[22] The thin lines are substantial and the lower-case letters have a larger x-height, and (perhaps ironically) it returns to the condensed nature of the original Century Roman.[23] This was the second-to-last face cut by A.T.F. Scangraphic has released a digitisation.[24] Related digital revivals[edit] Comparison between Century Schoolbook (in Monotype's digitisation) and Old Standard by Alexey Kryukov, based on nineteenth-century printing especially from Russia. Both have the same basic letter structure but Old Standard is much more crisp with finer hairlines and serifs, especially in italic. Nick Shinn's Scotch Modern revival is a digitisation in three optical sizes of the Scotch Modern types that inspired Century.[4] Described by reviewer Mark Simonson as 'insanely complete', it has a stronger level of contrast and sharper Didone serifs than Century designs, in a release featuring small caps and a range of matching figure designs.[25][26] Shinn based the revival on that used in an 1873 book on New York State wildlife. The Old Standard web font by Alexey Kryukov is loosely based on the similar styles of type that were used in Europe during the early 20th century. It includes Cyrillic and polytonic Greek glyphs for classical studies use.[27] Matthew Carter's Miller is a revival of the Scotch Roman types that are Century's distant ancestors in the early nineteenth century. It features a much more restrained level of stroke contrast. It is an extremely large family often used by newspapers, with five optical sizes and many professional features such as small caps and alternate figure designs.[28] Chronicle Text and Display by Hoefler & Frere-Jones are another large Scotch Roman-inspired family with optical sizes intended for newspaper and professional use.[29] Eames Century Modern is a digitisation inspired by the family's use by furniture designers Charles and Ray Eames.[30] It is used by Comedy Central, among others.[31] Century 751 from Bitstream Inc is actually a digital revival of Rudolph Ruzicka's Primer.[32] See also[edit] Typefaces category List of typefaces References[edit] ^ Tichenor, Irene (2005).

Thomas AlcockBorn1709Aston, Runcorn, Cheshire, EnglandDied24 August 1798RuncornNationalityEnglishEducationWarrington SchoolBrasenose College, OxfordOccupationClergymanTitleReverendSpouse(s)Mary HarwoodParent(s)David Alcock, Mary Breck Thomas Alcock (1709 – 24 August 1798) was a clergyman in the Church of England, a pluralist and an author. Contents 1 Early life 2 Ministry 3 Farmer and cidermaker 4 Personal and family life 5 Publications 6 References Early life[edit] He was born at Aston, near Runcorn, Cheshire[1] the third son of David Alcock and his wife Mary née Breck. David Alcock was a descendant of Bishop John Alcock, the founder of Jesus College, Cambridge.[2] Thomas was educated at Boteler Grammar School Warrington,[3] then matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford in 1728, proceeded B.A. in 1731 and M.A. in 1741.[4] Ministry[edit] He was licensed as curate of Stonehouse, Plymouth in 1731. In November 1732 he began acting as the minister of the nearby parish of St Budeaux to which he was officially licensed the following year. He was also instituted as vicar of Runcorn in 1756 and ran this parish as a pluralist with the aid of curates.[1] He was a Cheshire J.P. but continued to spend most of his time in Devon and only returned to Runcorn towards the end of his life.[4] He became popular locally, particularly when he omitted to collect tithes. He was also noted for his eccentric habits, his spartan lifestyle, and his kindness to the poor to whom he also acted as doctor and lawyer.[5] In 1769 the living of St Andrew, Plymouth became vacant and Alcock expected to be elected to it. He was unsuccessful and refused to preach his regular sermon at the church or indeed to enter the church again.[6] In 1771 he helped to purchase land at Weston Peverel to provide a master for the St Budeaux charity school and to clothe the poor. In 1769 he was granted the freedom of the borough of Plymouth.[4] Farmer and cidermaker[edit] The Endemial Colic of Devon not Caused by a Solution of Lead in the Cyder Thomas Alcock farmed at Ernesettle and described himself as ‘A Cydermaker’. He attacked the excise duty on cider and this was repealed in 1766. It had been suggested that a severe colic peculiar to Devon was the result of lead poisoning from the presses, pipework, and storage vessels of cider. This was refuted by Alcock who argued that the colic resulted only from the small shot used in bottle cleansing.[7] Personal and family life[edit] He married Mary Harwood of Ernesettle, Plymouth and through his marriage he obtained considerable property locally.[8] The marriage was childless[4] and Mary died in 1777.

The yeshiva has over three thousand students, including those of affiliated institutions, and is considered one the leading Litvish yeshivas in Israel. Contents 1 History 2 Controversy 3 Notable teachers 4 Notable alumni 5 Affiliated institutions 6 References 7 External links History[edit] Founded in 1908, the yeshiva was originally located in city of Panevėžys (Ponevezh), Lithuania prior to the Holocaust.[1] After the death of its founder, Rabbi Yitzhak Yaakov Rabinovich, the yeshiva was re-established in Bnei Brak in 1944 by Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, who was residing in British Mandate of Palestine at the time.[2][3] Kahaneman appointed Rabbi Shmuel Rozovsky as dean, and some years later appointed Rabbi Dovid Povarsky as rosh yeshiva. The Kahaneman faction of the yeshiva is led by Rabbi Gershon Eidelstein and Rabbi Berel Povarsky, son of Rabbi Dovid Povarsky, and Rabbi Chaim Peretz Berman, a grandson of The Steipler, and a son-in-law of Rabbi Kahanaman. The Markovitz faction of the yeshiva is led by Rabbi Shmuel Markovitz, Rabbi Asher Deutch, and Rabbi Dessler. The main study hall has an original 16th-century Italian wooden aron kodesh (Torah scroll ark), brought to the yeshiva in the early 1980s, and restored and re-gilded with 22 carat gild leaf.

Since then, the yeshiva has split and resulted in two yeshivas in the same building, with the students occupying different dormitories, though studying in the same learning hall and eating in the same dining room.

Contents 1 History 2 Images 2.1 Members 2.2 Exhibitions 3 See also 4 References History[edit] According to the group's constitution: "The artists of Boston, deeply impressed with the importance of their profession, and with the necessity of a systematic course of study for its successful culmination; also with the advantages to be derived from mutual co-operation and support, resolve to form themselves into an association for the furtherance of these objects. In so doing, they pledge to each other their honor as gentlemen, to lay aside all ungenerous, envious, or selfish feelings, and to seek the advancement of the arts alone, for the art's sake."[1] There were "44 members in 1842, and 66 in 1845."[2] They held "regularly scheduled bi-weekly social meetings" in Chester Harding's space on School Street.[2] In the association's "studio ... both living models and casts were provided for members."[3] The association "had casts donated to them by member Henry Sargent, and negotiated to borrow some of those at the Athenaeum."[2] A school was organized in 1842, overseen by John Pope. Instructors included Samuel P. Long and B.F. Nutting. The school was located at first in Harding's Gallery on School Street, and from 1846 in rented rooms on Tremont Row.[2] Images[edit] Henry Sargent's The Dinner Party ca.1821; exhibited in the 1st exhibit of the Boston Artists Association, 1842 Chester Harding's portrait of Abbott Lawrence, ca.1842; exhibited in the 1st exhibit of the Boston Artists Association, 1842 Ad for 1842 exhibit of the Boston Artists Association Thomas Cole's Old Age from Voyage of Life, 1842; exhibited in the 2nd exhibit of the Boston Artists Association, 1843 Athenaeum, Pearl Street, where Boston Artists Association exhibits were held, 1845-1847 Members[edit] Francis Alexander[4] Washington Allston Joseph Alexander Ames (i.e. Joseph Eames)[4] Joseph Andrews[5] Thomas G.

She later looked for an artist to give the song to, eventually giving it to Ella Mai after feeling that "synergy of it would be perfect for her."[4] Mai originally released the song in February 2017 as part of the Ready EP. "Boo'd Up" rose in popularity on social media as well as in nightclubs over the next few months,[5] notably in the Bay Area and later in Dallas, Texas. After Mai served as the opening act on Kehlani's tour, her music reached a bigger audience and the song grew on radio airplay in the spring of 2018.[6] The song became her first top 10 song in the US in the following month, deeming it her "breakthrough hit".[7] Rolling Stone wrote that the single is "one of the biggest singles by a breakout female R&B singer in the past 10 years."[8] In support of the song and its commercial success, Mai announced a concert tour titled the Boo'd Up Tour in the US during the month of August.[9] In December 2018, Billboard magazine ranked "Boo'd Up" as the third best song of the year.[10] Music video[edit] An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Nick Walker, premiered via Mai's Vevo channel on 26 April 2018.[11] It features cameo appearances from singer Khalid, rapper Kamaiyah, and YouTube personality Alissa Ashley.[12][13] Model Donnell Blaylock Jr. plays Mai's love interest in the video.[14] As of August 2020, the music video has over 423 million views. Remixes[edit] Rappers Nicki Minaj, Fetty Wap, Plies, Fabolous, Dave East, Vado and Young Dro also released remixes to the song.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] Live performances[edit] On 17 November 2018, Mai performed the song on Saturday Night Live, with Jezebel describing Mai as "Pure '90s R&B Heartthrob".[23] It comes on the heels of Ella Mai’s critically acclaimed performance at the BET Awards 2018.[24][25] Charts[edit] Weekly charts[edit] Chart (2018) Peak position Australia (ARIA)[26] 46 Canada (Canadian Hot 100)[27] 43 Ireland (IRMA)[28] 85 Portugal (AFP)[29] 93 UK Singles (OCC)[30] 52 US Billboard Hot 100[31] 5 US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)[32] 4 US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard)[33] 28 US Rhythmic (Billboard)[34] 3 Year-end charts[edit] Chart (2018) Position US Billboard Hot 100[35] 15 US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)[36] 10 US Rhythmic (Billboard)[37] 16 Certifications[edit] Region Certification Certified units/sales Canada (Music Canada)[38] Platinum 80,000 United Kingdom (BPI)[39] Silver 200,000 United States (RIAA)[40] 5× Platinum 5,000,000 *sales figures based on certification alonesales+streaming figures based on certification alone Release history[edit] Region Date Format Label Ref.

Its music was also slightly modified with several parts being reorganized and changed.[45] Some of the lyrics in Minaj's verse of the song are: Still a Playboy bunny on Hef, though/So we gotta get the dollar like Creflo/He said that he want respect/I said, "That's dope"/But that goes both ways like DeJ Loaf, uh.[44] Composition[edit] The music of "Boo'd Up" is mostly kept the same as the original, with the sound being slightly altered and several parts reorganized. The remix also contains a reference to Minaj's 2011 hit, "Super Bass".[46] Migos member Quavo drops an ad-libbed verse of his own. The remix comes to a close with a faux recorded phone conversation between Quavo and Minaj. She asks him to be picked up from somewhere but he's actually already outside.[47] Track listing[edit] Digital download – Official Remix[48]No.TitleLength1."Boo'd Up (Remix)" (with Nicki Minaj and Quavo)3:37 Charts[edit] Chart (2018) Peak position Belgium (Ultratip Flanders)[49] 12 Belgium Urban (Ultratop Flanders)[50] 12 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)[51] 8 Certifications[edit] Region Certification Certified units/sales New Zealand (RMNZ)[52] Gold 15,000* *sales figures based on certification alonesales+streaming figures based on certification alone Release history[edit] Region Date Format Label Ref.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. Contents 1 Career 2 Summary of career 2.1 Ships attacked 2.2 Awards 3 References 3.1 Notes 3.2 Bibliography 4 External links Career[edit] In April 1933, Würdemann joined the Reichsmarine, which became the Kriegsmarine two years later. During the first year of the war he served on the destroyer Paul Jacobi, before transferring to the U-boat force in November 1940. After the usual training he served for one patrol aboard U-43 under Wolfgang Lüth, before commissioning the Type IXC U-boat U-506 in September 1941. He sailed on 5 war patrols, sank 15 merchant ships for a total of 76,714 gross register tons (GRT) and damaged 3 ships of a combined 23,358 GRT.[1] Würdemann's most successful patrol (his second) took him into the Gulf of Mexico in May 1942, where he sank nine ships and damaged three.[2] His next patrol took him to the waters off West Africa, where he sank another five ships and was involved in the Laconia incident.[1] After U-156 sank the passenger liner RMS Laconia, which was carrying 450 British and Polish soldiers and about 1,800 Italian prisoners of war, the U-boat commenced rescue operations, and was joined by others in the area, including U-506; but the U-boats were later attacked by an American aircraft, which resulted in Admiral Dönitz issuing an order to the Navy not to pick up survivors. Würdemann sailed to the waters off South Africa in early 1943 and sank two more ships.[1] Finally, on 14 July 1943, six days into his fifth patrol, Würdemann was killed, along with all but six of his crew, when U-506 was sunk in the Atlantic west of Vigo, Spain by depth charges dropped from a Consolidated B-24 Liberator of the United States Army Air Forces' 1st Antisubmarine Squadron.[3] Summary of career[edit] Ships attacked[edit] As commander of U-506 Erich Würdemann is credited with the sinking of 13 ships for a total of 61,011 GRT, further damaging three ships of 23,418 GRT and damaging one ship of 6,821 GRT so severely that it was a total loss.

The series is written by Darin Wagner and illustrated by Clint Hilinski and Andrew Dalhouse.[1] The series is recognized as the first Alias comic to feature traditional superheroes and contains such themes as the importance of fatherhood and the shallow nature of fame. Characters[edit] The Hyper-Actives are made up of teenaged superheroes recruited by Alphaman, the premiere superhero of the continuity featured within the book. Alphaman, an obvious homage to Superman, is essentially their mentor and they are essentially his wards, not unlike the relationship Batman has with Robin. As of Issue #03, the team's roster is as follows: Silverwing: A legacy-type superhero and most recent recipient of the "Silverwing Essence" Reactor Girl: A nuclear-powered supergirl and daughter of Alphaman Rush: Self-appointed leader of the team, superspeed hero and son of Alphaman Surefire: A weapon master, similar to the Marvel Comics anti-hero Punisher, though more satirical Honeychild: An African-American superheroine resembling Marvel Comics' Wasp Wereclaw: A feral looking, wolfman-type character Boy Genius: An inventive super-genius and the youngest member of the team Panzer: An apparently German superhero with the size, power and texture of a tank Scandal: Warps probability fields ("causing trouble"), possibly invisibility Story[edit] Hyper-Actives #00 is a 10-page preview issue which introduces the team and depicts them losing a fight with a cold-powered supervillain named Thrillchiller. The team is unfocused and too preoccupied with the nearby news crew to be effective in preventing Thrillchiller's jail break. Afterwards, Rush is shown blowing off the loss to a tabloid television reporter. This issue also introduces the character of Eddie Ellison, a high school student who eventually becomes the newest member of the team as Silverwing. Hyper-Actives #01 depicts the death of the long-running superhero named Silverwing and Eddie's transformation into the newest incarnation of Silverwing. Eddie is then approached by Alphaman and offered membership in his team, which was named "The Hyper-Actives" by the media and not Alphaman. Eddie arrives at the team's headquarters, referred to as the "Hypersphere" and is initially dismissed as a fanboy. It is here that we see superheroes first referring to normal people as "peds." The term is derogatory and phonetically reminiscent of the word "sped" (an inappropriate term used in referring to the mentally disabled). "Ped" is derived from the word "pedestrian", which is the word most of the adult superheroes use to describe normal people. The issue ends in a cliffhanger where a team of villains called "Uberforce" break into the Hypersphere and corner Silverwing. Hyper-Actives #02 continues the story, depicting Silverwing on the verge of single-handedly defeating Uberforce. He is prevented from actually doing so due to the arrival of the rest of the team. They distract Silverwing and he gets rendered unconscious. Uberforce easily defeats the rest of the team, thanks to their preparations made prior to the attack. Uberforce kidnaps two members and the rest of the H-As mount a rescue, excluding Silverwing, whom they reject as a member. The team makes their way to Uberforce's hideout, leaving Silverwing behind. Silverwing, however, discovers that he can magically modify vehicles into superhero versions (like the Batmobile) and uses his mother's car (so transformed) to follow them. Silverwing arrives in time to save the team from Uberforce. This issue suffered from incomplete copy and some pages have several pieces of dialogue missing while one had all of the dialogue missing. The reason for these omissions is not known, but creator Darin Wagner has stated on various message boards that it was a clerical error and that future reprints of the issue would have the full dialogue present. Hyper-Actives #03 depicts the team attending a yearly superhero convention. This convention is actually more like a real-life comic book convention, except that it features actual superheroes as opposed to actors who play them on TV and in movies. The team displays their obsession with attention in force at the con, and Rush in particular demonstrates his apathy toward the pedestrians in attendance. (At one point Rush casually takes a pedestrian's cell phone, interrupting the man's own phone call, so Rush can call his press agent. When the man protests, Rush says "Quiet ped! Can't you see Rush is on the phone?!"). During the convention, Reactor Girl is drawn into a catfight with a walk-on superheroine referred to as "K" (an obvious parody of Supergirl). The convention is interrupted by a mechanical menace called Ultimato, who constantly declares that he is indestructible and cannot be stopped. Rush initially ignores the threat, instead taking the opportunity for an interview from the media personnel in attendance, but eventually takes charge and attempts to convince Ultimato to destroy himself... citing numerous instances in which that technique worked. Silverwing, however, notices a weakness in Ultimato's chassis and, once Rush's plan fails, rallies the team to his side to try a physical assault. Rush does not join them and demonstrates immaturity and jealousy in doing so. The team defeats Ulitimato and is rewarded with a media blitz while Rush looks on from afar with a spiteful look. Hyper-Actives #04 takes place an unknown number of days after the convention and mostly in the Hypersphere. A black political pundit, referred to as a "mayor", is shown in a televised interview as criticizing the existence of the new Silverwing. He demands to know what happened to the previous one (who was black) and cites an overall shortage of black superheroes. (The "Mayor" is an obvious pastiche of New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, who once referred to New Orleans as a "chocolate city." The "Mayor" character refers to Silverwing as being a "chocolate superhero.") Rush attempts to use this interview as leverage to get a consensus from the rest of the team that they should kick Silverwing. The team does not want to, feeling good about their Ultimato victory. Wereclaw then flips the channel and shows that the footage of the argument Rush had with Silverwing outside the convention has actually been receiving more airtime than the pundit. Not having achieved the consensus he desired, Rush confronts Silverwing (who is in Eddie Ellison form) and demands that he pack up and leave, calling him a "ped" a number of times. Silverwing then gives Rush the etymology of the term, which is short for pedestrian, and defines it as "someone who travels on foot." As Rush is a superspeed runner, he is enraged by this and goes on a miniature megolomaniacal rant, declaring himself to be "the modern Mercury, the god of speed" and also manages to refer to Silverwing as "uppity." Silverwing then informs Rush that Mercury wasn't the god of anything, but rather the messenger of the gods and "had a paper route." (Rush demonstrated in the first issue that he abhorred the idea of having to work for a newspaper when it was suggested that his father, Alphaman, would make him take such a job if he didn't keep up on current events.) Rush zooms out of Silverwing's room in frustration and confronts Alphaman, demanding that Silverwing be removed from the team. Rush doesn't notice that Alphaman is holding a strange device in his hand. Alphaman attacks Rush, blasting at him with his laservision. Rush escapes death by vibrating, but the Hypersphere is partially destroyed by the attack. By the time the rest of the team is on the scene, Alphaman has flown off. Boy Genius identifies the device Alphaman was holding as having been constructed by Doktor Uberkoff (leader of the Uberforce). Uberkoff's attack on the sphere in issue one was a diversion in order to plant the device, which has bent Alphaman to his will. Silverwing concludes that Uberkoff was counting on the team's self-absorbed attitude to conceal the true nature of his attack. The team (minus Rush) then intercepts Alphaman and attempts to stop him from joining Uberkoff, while Rush speeds to the prison where Uberkoff is being held in order to somehow break his control over Alphaman. Rush narrowly reaches Uberkoff in time, having had to fight his way through Uberforce first to get to him. The issue ends with Silverwing in Alphaman's office and Alphaman confiding to Silverwing that he intends for Silverwing to be the team's leader. References[edit] ^ "Hyper-Actives Preview".

He graduated from Greenbrier Military School in 1934, then attended the University of Michigan (1934–1936) and the American Academy of Art in Chicago (1936–1938). During the 1940s, he wrote for The Bob Hope Show and worked with Hope on a newspaper humor column. On Broadway he performed in Arthur Klein's musical revue Tickets, Please! (1950), and he contributed sketch material to Leonard Sillman's New Faces of 1952. Price hosted the television panel show How To (1951), and he was a panelist on other game shows of the early 1950s: Who's There? What Happened? That Reminds Me, The Name's the Same and What's My Line? Droodles[edit] In 1953, Price invented Droodles, a syndicated feature which he described as "a borkley-looking sort of drawing that doesn't make any sense until you know the correct title." When Simon & Schuster published Price's Droodles in 1953, the book launched a Droodle craze that was fueled by a series of ads in college newspapers offering cash prizes for Droodles created by college students. In 1954, Price hosted a Droodles television game show with panelists Marc Connelly, Denise Lor and Carl Reiner. More Droodles were gathered in follow-up books, The Rich Sardine (1954) and Oodles of Droodles (1955). Over the years, many of the drawings (minus the author's droll commentary) have been reprinted in collections such as Classic Droodles. One of Price's original Droodles serves as the cover art for Frank Zappa's 1982 album Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch. Price's other captions for that drawing include "Mother pyramid feeding her baby." In 2000, after Stern and Sloan launched another publishing company, Tallfellow Press, they acquired the rights to Droodles and reissued it as Droodles: The Classic Collection. Price and Harvey Kurtzman[edit] Price had four articles in Harvey Kurtzman's Mad in 1955–1956[1] and later contributed to Kurtzman's 1960s magazine Help!. In the introduction to Mad's first paperback collection, The Mad Reader (Ballantine Books, 1954), he described Kurtzman's appearance: He is 5 feet 6 inches tall and has a physique that is just barely noticeable and a long expression. In fact, Harvey looks like a beagle who is too polite to mention that someone is standing on his tail. This Beagleishness has certain compensations – he is never ordered off the grass in Central Park and Pretty Girls frequently stop on the street to scratch him behind the ears.[2] Mad Libs and Price Stern Sloan[edit] The same year the Droodle was born, Price and Stern invented Mad Libs (although the first book in the series was not published until 1958). The title came about when the two were in Sardi's and overheard an actor arguing with his agent. The actor wanted to "ad-lib" an interview, but his agent thought such an approach was "mad". According to Stern, the concept was hatched accidentally.[3] Stern was scripting an episode for The Honeymooners in 1953 when Price came by. Stern recalled, "I was trying to find the right word to describe the nose of Ralph Kramden's new boss. So I asked Roger for an idea for an adjective and before I could tell him what it was describing, he threw out 'clumsy' and 'naked'. We both started laughing. We sat down and wrote a bunch of stories with blanks in them. That night we took them to a cocktail party and they were a great success ... We were turned down by every publisher in the New York area. Publishers told us it wasn't a book and suggested we approach game manufacturers, but they also rejected us and advised us to talk to publishers. It became a well-worn path."[3] A Publishers Weekly article described the rise of Mad Libs after the initial 1958 publication: The duo found a printer and self-published 14,000 copies. Soon thereafter, Ballantine Books founder (and friend) Ian Ballantine agreed to distribute the book on a short-term basis. That first printing did not last long. Stern, then head writer and comedy director for NBC's The Steve Allen Show, suggested to Allen that they use the Mad Libs format to introduce guest stars, with the audience supplying words. Allen agreed, and on the next show he held up Mad Libs as Bob Hope was introduced (audience members described the comedian as "scintillating" and dubbed his theme song, "Thanks for the Communists"). Within days, bookstores sold out of Mad Libs. In the early 1960s, Price and Stern partnered with Larry Sloan, an old high school friend of Stern's, to create their own publishing company. Sloan became CEO of Price Stern Sloan and his partners wrote additional Mad Libs titles, gearing them toward children since much of their fan mail was from kids. With multiple titles landing on bestseller lists and the house's acquisition of other popular properties including Wee Sing, Mr. Men and Little Miss and Serendipity, Price Stern Sloan grew to be what Stern terms "the biggest publisher west of the Mississippi at the time". In 1993, Stern and Sloan (Price had died three years earlier) sold their company to the Putnam Berkley Group.[4] Roger Price Gallery and Grump[edit] Don Silverstein illustration for Grump, edited and published by Roger Price in 1965–67 During the 1960s, Price opened the first New York art gallery devoted solely to cartoons.[citation needed] In 1965–1967 he published and edited the short-lived humor publication, Grump, which featured such contributors as Isaac Asimov, Christopher Cerf, Derek Robinson, Susan Sands, Jean Shepherd, and cartoonists Don Silverstein and David C. K. McClelland. He was the co-creator with Stanley Ralph Ross of the short-lived 1977 NBC situation comedy The Kallikaks, and he also wrote for the show. Personal life and death[edit] Price was married four times; all the marriages ended in divorce. He had two children with his second wife, Bettina Lerfield.[citation needed] At the time of his death in 1990, Price lived in Studio City, California. Books[edit] In One Head and Out the Other (Ballantine, 1951), which popularized the catchphrase "I had one grunch, but the eggplant over there." The nonsense non sequitur was immediately adopted by science fiction fandom, appearing occasionally in science fiction fanzines, as noted in Fancyclopedia II (1959). Using the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon's book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as a comparison to America's upheaval in the 60's, this satirical book compares Roman decline to America's woes. In Price's In One Head and Out the Other, the "bible of Avoidism", his character Clayton Slope "had a clever trick of saying any conceivable sentence so that it sounded like 'I had one grunch but the eggplant over there.' Fans find the expression useful, too ... "Avoidism: Not originally fannish at all, but a philosophy devised in a rather stomach-turning book, In One Head and Out the Other, this doctrine became confused/associated with the Gandhi-following folk of Eric Frank Russell's "And Then There Were None."[5] It inspired an APA, MYOB and an Avoidist Movement which avoided amounting to anything. Tenets are those implied by the root word. Lee Hoffman explains that three types of avoidism are distinguished: pure applied active (or Activist) In pure avoiding, one avoids everything except eating, breathing and metabolizing. In applied avoiding, one avoids as many things as possible. (Bus drivers are good at this sort of thing, like avoiding people waiting at bus stops.) Active avoidism isn't true avoidism and is practiced to Publicize the Cause, or as an exercise in Avoiding. Under active avoidism there is the subgroup Counteravoiding; to counteravoid vegetarianism, for instance, one eats meat. Leeh concluded: "A last word on Avoidism: I had one grunch but the eggplant over there."[6] An annoying Price dissident in In One Head and Out the Other who crops up from time to time to object forlornly to Avoidist doctrine in many of its guises is one Dr. Carl Gassoway, whom Price promptly and heartlessly dismisses every time as a troublemaker; a refreshing Price ingénue who similarly appears and reappears is Miss Patricia Delray. In a key chapter, Price advised mothers to encourage their offspring to adopt Avoidist habits and responses to the tribulations of real life is to have them read, as a nightly bedtime story, his adaptation of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf (which he first wanted to use in its original form until the composer demanded too many rubles' royalty), namely Milton and the Rhinoceros, in which the latter triumphs by overcoming and eating the former, whose final blunder was to mistake the FIERCE RHINOCEROS!! (as Price instructed the mother to shout loudly at key points in the narrative), when he first came upon the beast, for a Studebaker. Moral: Don't go into deep woodses! Or anywhere! Droodles (Simon & Schuster, 1953) I'm for Me First (Ballantine, 1954) is a humor book about Herman Clabbercutt's plan to launch a revolutionary political party known as the "I'm for Me First" Party. The Rich Sardine (1954) — Droodles collection Oodles of Droodles (1955) — Droodles collection J.G., the Upright Ape (1960), which publisher Lyle Stuart claimed was one of his worst-selling books. It was described by Robert Michael Pyle in Orion Afield (Autumn 1998): By chance, when I was buying Daniel Quinn's book (Ishmael) at Powell's Books in Portland, I first spotted Roger Price's J.G., The Upright Ape. This 1960 novel also employs the device of the gorilla as the protagonist. J.G. is a member of a fictional high-elevation subspecies called the silver gorillas. His search for his abducted mate, Lotus, in America becomes a vehicle for sharp, witty satire of contemporary culture. "For the first time in his life, J.G. was unhappy. It required great concentration on his part, because it isn't easy to be unhappy when you have such a tiny brain." Neither author can challenge Schaller's and Fossey's gorilla scholarship, but their fictions point to a conclusion that the researchers might recognize: gorillas—gentle, cooperative, environmentally benign—are in some ways better than humans.[7] What Not to Name the Baby (Price-Stern, 1960) The Great Roob Revolution (Random House, 1970) Partial filmography[edit] Mame (1974) – Ralph Divine Mixed Company (1974) – The Doctor The Strongest Man in the World (1975) – Roger At Long Last Love (1975) – Alfred The Day of the Locust (1975) – Guest #3 I Wonder Who's Killing Her Now?

(September 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Song from the musical West Side Story “America” is a song from the 1957 musical West Side Story. Stephen Sondheim wrote the lyrics and Leonard Bernstein composed the music. Contents 1 Content 2 Cover versions 3 Usage in popular culture 4 References 5 External links Content[edit] In the original stage version, Anita – the girlfriend of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks, and the most important female character after Maria – praises America while a fellow Puerto Rican, Rosalia, supports Puerto Rico. This version of the song deprecates the island and highlights the positive qualities of American life ("I’ll drive a Buick through San Juan/If there’s a road you can drive on"). The irony of this supposedly pro-American number, however, is its vibrantly Hispanic musical style, with Latin percussion, complex cross-rhythm and Spanish guitar. In the 1961 film version, Anita, played by Rita Moreno, still sings in favor of the United States while Bernardo, played by George Chakiris, replies with corresponding criticisms of America and American ethnic prejudice, especially against Puerto Ricans (“Life is alright in America/If you're all White in America”). Some of the original song’s disparagement was removed. In 2004, this version finished at No. 35 in AFI’s 100 Years…100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. The song employs a mixed meter: Original Broadway Cast "America" (1957) 27 second sample from the original Broadway casting of "West Side Story". Problems playing this file? See media help. The alternating bars of 68 (six eighth-notes in two groups of three) with 34 (three quarter-notes) (similar to a guajira) is a distinctive characteristic of the song. This rhythm has been called both a hemiola and a habanera but is not really either. The two bar-types alternate and are not superposed, as in a hemiola. The alternation is comparable with the “Habanera” from “Carmen”, but “America” lacks the distinctive characteristic underlying rhythm of the habanera form. The composer’s tempo instruction is “Tempo di Huapango”. Cover versions[edit] An instrumental version, with the signature rhythm reduced to a uniform 44, was released in 1963 by Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass on their album Volume 2. Trini Lopez covered "America" in 1963 for his first album Trini Lopez at PJ's. In 1968, The Nice, featuring Keith Emerson, covered an instrumental version of "America" as the band's second single. This version had the main theme playing against a straight 44 beat, also including pieces of Dvořák's New World Symphony, then changing in the middle to 68 for improvised guitar and organ solos. At a July 7, 1968, concert at the Royal Albert Hall, the band controversially burned an American flag after performing the song.[1] Emerson later folded the melody into a great many of his jams including the finale medley on Emerson, Lake & Palmer's 1992-1993 tours, which also used musical themes from "Blue Rondo à la Turk", a jazz standard composed by Dave Brubeck. An example of this medley can be found on the album Live at the Royal Albert Hall. The English psychobilly band King Kurt covered this song on an EP called America, released in 1986. The heavy-metal band Metallica incorporated a few bars from the song in the opening riff from their song, "Don't Tread on Me". The "America" melody again featured prominently in a 1986 jam with Paul Shaffer on Late Night with David Letterman. Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem performed an instrumental rendition on a 1979 episode of The Muppet Show before being interrupted by various Muppets from other countries. A version of this song was performed by the in-house band and singers to introduce a 2012 episode of the Polish version of Name That Tune, Jaka to Melodia?, complete with a set of dancers. This song was also used in an episode of Glee (season 3 episode 5: "The First Time"), and sung by Naya Rivera (as Santana Lopez) in the role of Anita, and Mark Salling (as Noah "Puck" Puckerman) in the role of Bernardo. In the progressive rock band Yes' cover of Simon & Garfunkel's "America", bassist Chris Squire quotes the West Side Story song near the conclusion of their instrumental intro. Usage in popular culture[edit] A theme from "America" was referenced by John Williams for his celebratory For New York, composed in 1988 for Bernstein's 70th birthday gala.[2] In 2011, the song was covered by the cast of musical comedy television series Glee in the fifth episode of the third season, "The First Time" (aired on November 8), with character Santana Lopez (portrayed by Naya Rivera) on the lead.[3] A minor controversy was caused over using the film version of the song, while a high school would normally use the stage version. In 2003, the song was used in advertisements for Admiral Insurance though with different lyrics. In 1994, the song was also the unofficial anthem at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States and was sung by the 3 Tenors (Plácido Domingo, José Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti) at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles to an estimated global TV audience of 1.3 billion viewers. A version of the song with modified lyrics is used in the end credits of the 2018 film Vice. A version of the song, with the same rhythm but a slightly adjusted melody, appeared in the Simpsons in August 2019 - 'The Simpsons' Mock Trump With 'West Side Story' Parody Featuring "The Squad"[4] The song is parodied during a medley of Broadway songs in Saturday Night Live’s 2020 sketch “Airport Sushi” about New York City’s LaGuardia airport, performed by John Mulaney, Cecily Strong, and Kenan Thompson.[5] References[edit] ^ Dome, Malcolm.

The Starlight Express is a children's play by Violet Pearn,[1] based on the imaginative novel A Prisoner in Fairyland by Algernon Blackwood, with songs and incidental music written by the English composer Sir Edward Elgar in 1915.

The play was The Starlight Express, an adaptation of a novel by Algernon Blackwood called A Prisoner in Fairyland, by Blackwood and Violet Pearn. The baritone and composer Clive Carey had already started his own setting, but abandoned it when Elgar was commissioned.[2] The producer was to be Basil Dean: but since he had been called up for army service in France, he was replaced by the actress Lena Ashwell.[3] Elgar was soon shown the script by Ashwell and had successful meetings with her and with Blackwood. The story appealed to Elgar because of its similarities to the private fantasy world of his own childhood which he had depicted in the music he wrote for "The Wand of Youth"; his first thought was to re-use that music, and he wove many reminiscences of it into the score. He worked on it enthusiastically, and in just over a month had produced over 300 pages of score – songs and incidental music – in time for the rehearsals. On 6 December the two chosen singers, the Australian-born soprano Clytie Hine and baritone Charles Mott,[4] rehearsed with Elgar. The Starlight Express was produced by Lena Ashwell at the Kingsway Theatre in London, as one of her high-quality wartime entertainments. The production was announced in The Times, mentioning that the small orchestra pit of the theatre would be enlarged to accommodate a full orchestra.[5] It opened on 29 December 1915. The premiere was to have been the conducted by the composer, but because Lady Elgar had suffered concussion a few days before as the result of a traffic accident, he stayed at home with her, and the conductor was the young Julius Harrison.[6] It ran for only one month, closing on 29 January 1916. The reasons for the failure were inappropriate design of the characters and scenery by Henry Wilson (who had been chosen and his work approved by Lena Ashwell), and the difficulty Pearn had in making something theatrical with her adaptation of the book. Both Blackwood and Elgar had expressed misgivings about the design, and Blackwood had considered using his right to object and get a new artist. Blackwood objected to "this murder of my simple little Play ... Arts & Crafts pretentious rubbish stitched onto your music by a silly crank who has never read the play". Elgar agreed. This would have meant postponement of the opening. The critics who reported their view of the opening night, while praising the music and particular performers, remarked on the lack of substance to the story. The music did not deserve to be forgotten. Elgar negotiated with The Gramophone Company, and on 18 February 1916, the music was recorded on eight sides, with the songs performed by Agnes Nicholls and Charles Mott. Later that year the three Organ Grinder's Songs were published by Elkin, with a piano accompaniment arranged by Julius Harrison.

"My Old Tunes" Synopsis[edit] Act I[edit] After a short musical overture, the Organ grinder appears in front of the curtain and sings "To the Children". The Song (first at the words "eyes; Let me sleep a moment") includes self-quotations of "The Little Bells" music from "The Wand of Youth". Song 1. The Organ Grinder: "To the Children" O children, open your arms to me, Let your hair fall over my eyes; Let me sleep a moment – and then awake In your garden of sweet surprise ! For the grown up folk are a wearisome folk, And they laugh all my fancies to scorn, The grown up folk are a wearisome folk, And they laugh all my fancies to scorn, They laugh all my fancies to scorn. O children, open your hearts to me, And tell me your wonder thoughts, Who lives in the palace inside your brain? Who plays in its outer courts? Who hides in the hours To-morrow holds? Who sleeps in your Yesterdays? Who tip-toes along past the curtained folds Of the shadow that Twilight lays? O children, open your eyes to me, And tell me your visions too. Who squeezes the sponge when the salt tears flow To dim their magical blue? Who brushes the fringe of their lace-veined lids? Who trims their innocent light? Who draws up the blinds when the sun peeps in? Who fastens them down at night? O children, I pray you speak low to me, And cover my eyes with your hands. O kiss me again till I sleep and dream That I'm lost in your fairy-lands; That I'm lost in your fairy-lands; For the grown-up folk are a troublesome folk, And the book of their childhood is torn! Is blotted, and crumpled, and torn! The music continues through the curtain rise on the first scene Scene 1[edit] The curtain rises on a family living in a pension in the mountains of Switzerland, showing grown-ups with problems which are first expressed unaccompanied by music: there is Daddy (an unsuccessful author), Mother (with domestic problems), the pension manager Widow Jequier with residents that do not pay, old Miss Waghorn always searching for her long-lost brother, and Cousin Henry. The children identify with star constellations: Jane Anne the Pleiades, Jimbo the Pole Star, and Monkey with the Great and Little Bear. Cousin Henry is Orion. The children are concerned that the adults who have become 'wumbled' (worried/muddled) need 'sympathy' in the form of star-dust. There is incidental music but there are no songs in this act, which has only one scene. Act II[edit] Before the curtain opens, there is a short musical prelude, and the Organ Grinder sings the waltz-song "The Blue-Eyes Fairy". Song 2. The Organ Grinder: "The Blue-Eyes Fairy" There's a fairy that hides in the beautiful eyes Of the children who treat her well; In the little round hole where the eyeball lies She weaves her magical Spell. She is awfully tiny and shy to the sight, But her magic's past believing, For she fills you with light and with laughter, It's the spell of her own sweet weaving. But! the eyes must be blue, And the heart must be true, And the child must be better than gold! And then if you'll let her, The quicker the better She'll make you forget that you're old. So, if such a child you should chance to see, Or with such a child to play, No matter how tired or dull you be, Nor how many tons you weigh You will suddenly find that you're young again, And your movements light and airy And you'll try to be solemn and stiff in vain- It's the spell of the Blue-Eyes Fairy. The scene is concluded by an Entr’acte "In the Forest". Scene 1[edit] Scene 1 – Part 1 The curtain rises during the Entr’acte music. Cousin Henry, Monkey and Jimbo are outside the Star-Cave at the edge of a pine-forest. The cave is too narrow for them to enter. They fall asleep. The Sprites appear and Night falls. The Organ-Grinder sings the Curfew Song. The Sprites hide. Song 3. The Organ Grinder: "The Curfew Song" The sun has gone; The tide of stars is setting all our way, The Pleiades call softly to Orion, As nightly they have called these million years; The children lie asleep; now let them out, And, over-hearing, We waft the fairy call into your dreams, That you may swim upon that tide of gold And list'ning in your hearts, Just over-hear That deep tremendous thunder Signalling reply: All's well! Orion answering the Pleiades! There is the Dance of the Pleiades as the curtain falls. Scene 1 – Part 2 The curtain rises. It is now night-time and the children are awake. The introduction includes a violin and harp duet, and the "Little Bells" music from "The Wand of Youth". The Sprites descend from the Starlight Express: they are the Organ Grinder, the Sweep who sweeps worries away, the Dustman with the stardust of sympathy, the Lamplighter who lights up hope (and the stars), the Head Gardener who makes things grow, the Tramp with instinctive simplicity, and the 'Laugher' who sings troubles into joy. The Woman-of-the-Haystack is the mother of them all, borne on the winds. Song 4. The Laugher: "I'm everywhere" (laughs) I'm everywhere, The universal solvent of despair, (laughs) Ah! that sings away the half Of ev'ry care because I laugh! I laugh Song 5. The Organ Grinder: "Come Little Winds" Wake up, you little Night Winds : Blow your best ! We want you all - Ha-ha! that's East and West, The North Wind too, She always blows the strongest: You all must draw your deepest breath and longest, With open mouth! Now go and blow the Haystack out of bed! Whistle her dreams of straw across the sky And whirl her canvas skirts about her head - You can but try! Go, sweep her to'ards the Cave, and break her trance: Thick Mother of the Sprites - She must get in: Even a Haystack's elephantine dance Is somewhere thin! Is somewhere thin! Interlude The "Sun Dance" and "Moths and Butterflies" music from the "Wand of Youth" Scene 2[edit] Prelude The prelude includes a quotation from the "Fairy Pipers" of "The Wand of Youth". The Sprites enter the cave and scatter stardust on the sleeping villagers. The Dustman scatters the finest dust on the ancient Miss Waghorn, who rests from the search for her brother. The Lamplighter exits to tend "the fires that are going out round the world." Scene 3[edit] The Introduction while the curtain rises includes "Moths and Butterflies" from "The Wand of Youth". Song 6. The Laugher: "Tears and Laughter" Oh! stars shine brightly! He's sleeping tightly ! His pattern's pouring through! Oh! Sprites come swiftly! Unwumble deftly! The world has need of you! They'll listen to my song And understand That, exiled over long, From Fairyland, The weary world has rather lost its way! Rather lost its way! My secret's double, For tears of trouble Are really tears of laughter gone astray. Song 7. Soprano (Jane Anne's song): "Dawn Song" We shall meet the morning spiders, The fairy cotton riders, Each mounted, each mounted on a star's reflected ray. With their tiny nets of feather. They collect our thoughts together, And on strips of windy weather bring the Day, And on strips of windy weather bring the Day! The curtain falls at the end of the scene. Act III[edit] After a short prelude which includes part of the "March" from "The Wand of Youth", The Organ Grinder sings "My Old Tunes". Song 8. The Organ Grinder: "My Old Tunes" My old tunes are rather broken And they come from far away, Bring just a little token Of a long-forgotten day; When the children came to listen, T'other side the garden fence, And my heart leapt out of prison At the gift – of seven pence! Just beyond the Haystack's shadow, Long ago, that leafy June, How they danced about the meadow At the rising of the moon! While from out a railway carriage, Standing ready and alight, Stepped their guests as to a marriage - Asked to dine – and stay the night! Sweep and Laugher danced together, And a man who had a lamp Capered lightly as a feather With a lazy-looking Tramp; When a Voice disturbed the Lancers: "Children, come, it's time for bed" Railway carriage, Sprites and Dancers Flew up to the stars instead! Now I am a Constellation, Free from ev'ry earthly care, Playing nightly at my station For the Big and Little Bear. But my tunes are still entrancing As that night in leafy June, When I caught the children dancing With the Sprites beneath the moon! Still the children come to hear me In the lane or dingy street; Still the heavy pavement near me Flutters to their happy feet; For my tunes are ne'er forgotten, And they bring the scent of musk: Grown-up folk may call 'em rotten, But I'm looked for when it's dusk! Scene 1[edit] The curtain rises on Jane Anne. Song 9. Jane Anne: "Dandelions, daffodils" Dandelions, daffodils, Sheets of yaller roses, Goldenrods and Marigolds, Buttercups for posies! The curtain closes for the Entr’acte which is the "Blue-Eyes Fairy" Waltz, and this is followed by the "Dance of the Pleiades". Scene 2[edit] The final scene is the Pine forest by night, before the Star Cave. Madame Jequier rejoices because Cousin Henry has secretly paid all the debts of her pension. Daddy enters, speaking through the "Starlight" music:...The source of our life is hid with Beauty very, very far away. Our real continuous life is spiritual. The bodily life uses what it can bring over from this enormous under-running sea of universal consciousness where we are all together, splendid, free, untamed; where thinking is creation, and where we see and know each other face to face... Song 10. The Laugher: "Laugh a little ev'ry day" Laugh a little ev'ry day At yourself, that is to say. Plan it, seed it. Millions want it. Hark! Their dreams Have split the seams. Song 11. Organ Grinder: "The Dawn" They're all soft-shiny now The time draws near; Their hearts are dusted And the path's swept clear! The tide of stars is setting all one way, Bring on the dawn – yet not the dawn of day! Incidental music, including the "Dance of the Pleides" and "Fairy Pipers" from "The Wand of Youth". Song 12. Jane Anne: "Oh, think Beauty" Oh, think Beauty, It's your duty. Ev'ry loving gentle thought Of this fairy brilliance wrought. While the busy Pleiades, Sisters to the Hyades, Seven by seven, Across the Heaven. Finale[edit] The stone is rolled away from the Star-cave. The scene is brightened by the entrance of the Sprites, and the humans enter. The ghost of Miss Waghorn enters 'clothed in light'. Song 13. Jane Anne and Cousin Henry (Organ Grinder): Jane Anne (Laugher): Dustman, Laugher, Tramp and busy Sweep, Head Gardener too, The world now waking from her heavy sleep Has need of You! Gypsy, Lampman, come! take of our best, Our sweetest dust And sow earth's little gardens of unrest With joy and trust - For ev'ry hour A golden flower, For ev'ry hour A golden flower, Love, Laughter, Courage, Hope, and all the Duet Jane Anne and Cousin Henry (Organ Grinder): JA ( rest – - – - – -. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)

The reviewer, the drama critic Joseph Thorp, used to sign himself "T". Curiously, Clytie Hine, 'The Laugher', gets no mention. The Musical Times thought well of her.

Charles Mott It would be uncandid to pretend that Mr. ALGERNON BLACKWOOD gets everything he has to say in The Starlight Express safely across the footlights – those fateful barriers that trap so many excellent intentions. But he so evidently has something to say, and the saying is so gallantly attempted, that he must emphatically be credited with something done – something well done really. The little play has beautiful moments – and that is to say a great deal. The novelist turned playwright wishes to make you see that "the Earth's forgotten it's a Star". In plainer words he wants to present you with a cure for "wumbledness": people who look at the black side of things, who think chiefly of themselves – those are the wumbled. The cure is stardust – which is sympathy. The treatment was discovered by the children of a poor author in a cheap Swiss pension and by "Cousin Henry" a successful business man of quite an unusual sort. You have to get out into the cave where the starlight is stored, gather it – with the help of the Organ Grinder, who loves all children and sings his cheery way to the stars; and the Gardener who makes good things grow and picks up all the weeds; and the Lamplighter who lights up heads and hearts and stars impartially; and the Sweep, who sweeps away all blacks and blues over the edge of the world; and the Dustman, with his sack of Dream Dust that is Star Dust (or isn't it?) and so forth. Then you sprinkle the precious stuff on people and they become miracles of content and unselfishness (The fact that life isn't in the very least like that is a thing you have just got to make yourself forget for three hours or so). The author was well served by his associates. SIR EDWARD ELGAR wove a delightfully patterned music of mysterious import through the queer tangle of the scenes and gave us an atmosphere loaded with the finest stardust. Lighting and setting were admirably contrived; and the grouping of the little prologue scenes, where that kindly handsome giant of an organ-grinder (MR. CHARLES MOTT), with the superbly cut corduroys, sang so tunefully to as sweet a flock of little maids as one would wish to see, was particularly effective. Of the players I would especially commend the delicately sensitive performance of MISS MERCIA CAMERON (a name and talent quite new to me) as Jane Anne, the chief opponent of wumbledom. She was, I think, responsible more than any other for getting some of the mystery of the authentic Blackwood craft across to the audience. The jolly spontaneity of RONALD HAMMOND as young Bimbo was a pleasant thing, and ELSIE HALL, concealing less successfully her careful training in the part, prettily co-operated as his sister Monkey. The part of Daddy, the congested author who was either "going to light the world or burst" was in O. B. CLARENCE'S clever sympathetic hands. MR OWEN ROUGHWOOD gave you a sense of his belief in the efficacy of stardust. On what a difficult rail our author was occasionally driving his express you may judge, when he makes this excellent but not particularly fragile British type exclaim "I am melting down in dew". The flippant hearer has always to be inhibiting irreverent speculations occasioned by such speeches. I couldn't guess if the children in the audience liked it. I hope they didn't feel they had been spoofed, as MAETERLINCK so basely spoofed them in The Blue Bird, by offering them a grown-up's play "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought". But the bigger children gave the piece a good welcome and called and acclaimed the shrinking author.— /quotation Legacy[edit] The Starlight Express was not the only collaboration of Blackwood and Pearn.

Through The Crack (an adaptation of The Education of Uncle Paul by Blackwood). London and New York: Samuel French. Produced at Christmas 1920, then in 1925. On 22 May 1918, Lance Corporal Charles James Mott, the successful singer in that first production of The Starlight Express was in the London Regiment (Artists' Rifles) when he was mortally wounded by a German shell-burst.[13] He was 37. Elgar, writing to a friend, said "It is difficult to believe that Charles Mott is dead; dead of wounds in France. I am overwhelmed: a simple, honest GOOD soul." In 1933 the conductor Joseph Lewis constructed from the score a 40-minute selection from The Starlight Express which he conducted in several BBC radio broadcasts. But his score and other valuable BBC material was destroyed in an air-raid in 1940. In September 1940 the Kingsway Theatre was damaged by fire in an air raid. All The Starlight Express stage props and music (conductor's score and orchestra parts) was destroyed. However, Elgar had left his manuscript full score of the music with the publishers, Messrs Elkin & Co., and apart from memories and reviews, this became the only surviving remnant. Fortunately this score also contained many of his own written notes on the performance. The score is signed "Edward Elgar, Finis, A.E. December 1915" – A. E. was his wife's initials, and Elgar, typically doubled the pun with the inscription "AE 15" (abbreviated Latin "AETATIS 15", English "Age 15"): he was a child again! In 1984 Richard Adams provided a 'performing narrative' to accompany a performance of Elgar's score in the Netherlands. The narrator for the occasion was composer Michael Berkeley. Recordings[edit] On 18–19 February 1916, a selection of the songs and music were given an acoustic recording at the HMV Studios, Hayes, by The Gramophone Company. The singers were Charles Mott and Agnes Nicholls, and Elgar conducted the "Symphony Orchestra". There were four 12-inch records (D455-8): (1) To the Children and The Blue-Eyes Fairy (Mott); (2) My Old Tunes and Curfew Song (Mott); (3) Come Little Winds (Mott), Wind Dance (orchestra), Tears and Laughter and Sunrise Song (Nicholls); (4) The Laugher's Song (Nicholls) and Finale – Hearts must be soft-shiny dressed (Nicholls and Mott).[14] In December 1935, four of the songs were recorded at the HMV Studios, Hayes, by The Gramophone Company. The singers were Stuart Robertson and his wife Alice Moxon. It is not known who conducted the orchestra. The songs were To the Children, The Laugher's Song, The Blue-Eyes Fairy and My Old Tunes. On 26 September 1946, two of the Organ Grinder's songs (My old tunes and To the Children) were recorded at Decca Studios in London. The singer was Henry Cummings, with an orchestra conducted by Charles Groves (in his first recording session). In 1964 EMI/HMV released The Miniature Elgar inspired by the BBC-TV Monitor film. It included the songs My old Tunes and To the Children, performed by Frederick Harvey with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Lawrance Collingwood. In 1973, Chandos Records recorded some of the songs, performed by John Lawrenson and Cynthia Glover, with Michael Austin (organ) and the Bournemouth Sinfonietta conducted by George Hurst. The songs were To the Children, The Blue-Eyes Fairy, The Laugher's Song, Tears and Laughter, The Dawn Song, My Old Tunes, Jane Anne's song and Finale. In 1974–1975, a complete recording was made by EMI/HMV on 28/29 November 1974, 20/22 December 1974 and 22 October 1975. This was at Abbey Road Studios, London. The singers were Derek Hammond-Stroud and Valerie Masterson, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vernon Handley. In December 1990 some of the songs were recorded by Decca Records at the Brangwyn Hall, Swansea. The singers were Bryn Terfel and Alison Hagley, with the Welsh National Opera Chorus and Welsh National Opera Orchestra conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras. The songs were To the Children, The Blue-Eyes Fairy, The Laugher's Song, Come Little Winds, Tears and Laughter, The Dawn Song, My Old Tunes, Jane Anne's song and Finale. A 1992 Koss Classics release of lesser-known works by Elgar, performed by the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Raymond Leppard, included the orchestral Overture and Finale. In 1997, the 1990 Decca recording of 'The Starlight Express' was remastered.[15] The Starlight Express London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Vernon Handley, with Valerie Masterson (soprano) and Derek Hammond-Stroud (baritone) The Starlight Express Suite Cynthia Glover (Soprano), John Lawrenson (Baritone), Bournemouth Sinfonietta conducted by George Hurst.

Dr. Azahari bin Husin (14 September 1957 – 9 November 2005), also Azahari Husin, Azhari Husin, was a Malaysian who was believed to be the technical mastermind behind the 2002 Bali bombing. He was killed in a police raid on his hideout in Indonesia in 2005. He was nicknamed the "Demolition Man". Contents 1 History 2 Death 3 References 4 External links History[edit] He received extensive bomb training in Afghanistan. He authored the JI bomb manual, used in the Bali bombing and the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing. He also planned the 2004 Jakarta embassy bombing and was implicated in the 2005 Bali bombings. Prior to his death, he was one of the most wanted men in Indonesia along with Noordin Mohammed Top. In July 2004, Husin and Noordin narrowly escaped a police raid on a rented house west of Jakarta, where forensic experts later found traces of explosives used in the embassy bombing. Neighbours described both as reclusive men who left the property only to pray at a nearby mosque; and they said that before the bombing, they saw the duo loading heavy boxes into a white delivery van which is the same type used in that attack. [1] Before the Marriott Hotel bombing, Husin is known to have stayed with Asmar Latin Sani, the suspected Marriott suicide bomber, at his home in Bengkulu on the island of Sumatra.[2] Both men were close associates of Jemaah Islamiyah's former operational chief, Riduan Isamuddin (better known as Hambali), who was captured in Thailand in 2003.[1] Death[edit] On 9 November 2005, Indonesian police, acting on a tip-off, located Husin. They conducted a raid on one of his hideouts in Batu, near Malang in East Java with Detachment 88 operators sent to assist regular police officers. Three suspected jihadist terrorists barricaded themselves inside a house and they put up stiff resistance, throwing grenades and firing bullets at the police outside. This was followed by a series of explosions, one of which was a suicide blast by his assistant setting off his bomb vest.[3] Police identified the intact corpse of Azahari, with a bullet wound in his chest.[4][5] Husin was shot and killed by a police sniper, after which one of his disciples blew himself up to prevent him from being taken alive.

Riihimäki glass (Finnish: Riihimäen lasi) was a reputed glass company in Riihimäki, Finland, in operation from 1910,[1] when it was founded by Mikko Adolf Kolehmainen, to 1990.[2] Their production ranged from basic to high quality[3] glass ornaments, which are now sought after as collectibles, especially some of their vases. Riihimäki products are readily available via collectors' web sites, as are their values. It produced everyday glassware and art glass until 1976 and cut glass until 1977. After that, it made only glass and plastic packaging. Ahlstrom Corporation purchased the company in 1980, and closed the Riihimäki plant in 1990. Among the acclaimed designers associated with Riihimäki in its early decades were Henry Ericsson, Arttu Brummer, Gunnel Nyman, and after 1945, Tamara Aladin, Greta-Lisa Jäderholm-Snellman, Aimo Okkolin, Sakari Pykälä, Timo Sarpaneva, Erkkitapio Siiroinen, Nanny Still, and Helena Tynell.

Swiss conductor Ernst Peter Johannes Maag (10 May 1919 – 16 April 2001) was a Swiss conductor. Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 2.1 Association with Furtwängler 2.2 Conductor 2.3 Religious retreat 2.4 Return to conducting 2.5 Recordings 3 Personal life 4 Awards 5 References 6 External links Early life[edit] Peter Maag was born on 10 May 1919 in St. Gallen, Switzerland and died on 16 April 2001 in Verona, Italy. His father, Otto, was a Lutheran minister, and his mother, Nelly, a violinist who performed in the Capet Quartet as second violinist. His great uncles were conductors Emil and Fritz Steinbach. Peter attended the universities of Zürich, Basel, and Geneva. He was mentored by Karl Barth and Emil Brunner in theology, and Karl Jaspers in philosophy. He studied piano and theory with Czesław Marek in Zürich and received further training on piano with Alfred Cortot in Paris. His conducting mentors were Ernest Ansermet, Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Franz von Hoesslin. Career[edit] Association with Furtwängler[edit] Maag described his association with Wilhelm Furtwängler to be the most important in his life. He performed as pianist in a Furtwängler concert with Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major. As recounted by Maag, Furtwängler told him: "Why don't you try to conduct? I have observed you while you were playing the concert tonight, staring at the orchestra more than at the keyboard. It was more you than me that have given the entry." He followed Furtwängler's advice to start out at a small theatre. His new career began as répétiteur and then director at the Swiss Theater Biel-Solothurn from 1943 to 1946. After the first season at Biel-Solothurn, he served as an assistant to Furtwängler prior to the opening of his second season there. After Biel-Solothurn, he became Ernest Ansermet's assistant with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Conductor[edit] Maag was first conductor at the Düsseldorf Opera from 1952 to 1955, and then Generalmusikdirektor of the Bonn City Theater from 1955 to 1959. His first appearance at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden was in 1959, with Mozart's Die Zauberflöte. In the same year he made his debut at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. His U.S. debut was as guest conductor in 1959 of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, and he made his U.S. opera debut in 1961 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago with Mozart's Così fan tutte. Religious retreat[edit] In 1962, Maag temporarily abandoned his musical career. Believing he was losing touch with music and theology, he sought guidance first from the Greek Orthodox Church and then planned to spend a few months at a Buddhist monastery near Hong Kong. "I decided it was time to retire because I was having too much success," Maag said. The planned "few months" grew to over two years. "Those two years spent meditating and praying in a small cell purified my soul." Maag’s retreat proved to be a detriment to his career when he returned to the world of conducting.[citation needed] Return to conducting[edit] Maag was the chief conductor of the Vienna Volksoper from 1964 to 1968. His Metropolitan Opera debut was made on 23 September 1972 with Mozart's Don Giovanni. He became artistic director of the Teatro Regio di Parma in 1972 and of the Teatro Regio in Turin in 1974. He held posts at the RAI Symphony Orchestra, Turin and the Orquesta Nacional de España. He was the music director of the Berner Symphonie-Orchester from 1984 to 1991. He served as the principal conductor of the Orchestra di Padova e del Veneto from 1983 to 2001. He was also a frequent guest conductor with orchestras and opera houses worldwide. Recordings[edit] He began recording for Decca Records in October 1950 with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. These monaural recordings included Mozart's Symphony No. 29 and Symphony No. 34 and Serenade No. 9 "Posthorn". Maag's early stereophonic sound recordings for Decca were well received, and many have remained in the catalogs for decades. The original LPs, particularly with the London Symphony Orchestra, have become collector's items. He began recording with the London Symphony Orchestra in February 1957. This included a series of Mendelssohn and Mozart works, and the Schumann Piano Concerto. Maag’s favorite recordings came from this association: Mozart’s Symphony No. 29 and Symphony No. 34. His recording from this period of Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3 (the "Scottish" symphony) was widely admired, and Maag came to be particularly associated with the piece. Maag also recorded two LPs with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in November 1958 with works of Chopin, Delibes, and Rossini. For Decca he also recorded Verdi's Luisa Miller with the National Philharmonic Orchestra in June 1975 and Paer's Leonora with the Bavarian Symphony Orchestra (likely the Bavarian State Orchestra) in June and July 1978. With the Berner Symphonie-Orchester of which he was Music Director, Maag made recordings for Innovative Music Productions in the late 1980s. They were licensed to MCA Records for sale in the USA. Other labels he recorded for include Arts, Conifer, Deutsche Grammophon, Naxos Records, Nuova Era, RCA Red Seal Records, and Vox Records. Personal life[edit] Maag's first wife was Jasmina Božin, a stage designer from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Maag was survived by his second wife, Marica Franchi (Marika); a son Georg, a writer of children's books, and a daughter Costanza, from his second wife.

In computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken. The definition is as IETF RFC 2828[1] that is the same as CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 by Committee on National Security Systems of United States of America.[2] According to the Glossary[3] by InfosecToday, the meaning of countermeasure is: The deployment of a set of security services to protect against a security threat. A synonym is security control.[2][4] In telecommunications, communication countermeasures are defined as security services as part of OSI Reference model by ITU-T X.800 Recommendation. X.800 and ISO ISO 7498-2 (Information processing systems – Open systems interconnection – Basic Reference Model – Part 2: Security architecture are technically aligned.

The result can potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability properties of resources (potentially different that the vulnerable one) of the organization and others involved parties (customers, suppliers). The so-called CIA triad is the basis of information security. The attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A "passive attack" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources, compromising confidentiality. A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger enabling the exploitation of a vulnerability. A threat can be either "intentional" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or "accidental" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an "act of God" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).[1] A set of policies concerned with information security management, the information security management systems (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to risk management principles, the countermeasures in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.[4] Contents 1 Countermeasures Against Physical Attacks 1.1 Electronic Destruction Devices 1.2 Hard Drives and Storage 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Countermeasures Against Physical Attacks[edit] If a potential malicious actor has physical access to a computer system, they have a greater chance of inflicting harm upon it. Electronic Destruction Devices[edit] Devices such as a USB Killer may be used to damage or render completely unusable anything with a connection to the motherboard of a computer, such as a USB port, video port, Ethernet port, or serial port.[5] Without proper protection, these devices may result in the destruction of ports, adapter cards, storage devices, RAM, motherboards, CPUs, or anything physically connected to the device attacked, such as monitors, flash drives, or wired switches. These types of devices can even be used to damage smartphones and cars, as well.[6] This threat can be mitigated by not installing or restricting physical access to easily accessible ports in situations where they are not necessary. A port-closing lock which permanently disables access to a port short of the actual port being disassembled.[7] When it is necessary for a port to be accessible, an optocoupler can allow for a port to send and receive data to a computer or device without a direct electrical connection, preventing the computer or device from receiving any dangerous voltage from an external device.[8] Hard Drives and Storage[edit] In an unsecured scenario, a malicious actor may steal or destroy storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, resulting in the destruction or theft of valuable data. If the data of a storage device is no longer necessary, data theft is best prevented against by physically destroying or shredding the storage device.[9] If the data of a storage device is in use and must be secured, one can use encryption to encrypt the contents of a storage device, or even encrypt the whole storage device save for the master boot record. The device can then be unlocked with a password, biometric authentication, a physical dongle, a network interchange, a one-time password, or any combination thereof. If this device is a boot drive, however, it must be unencrypted in a pre-boot environment so the operating system can be accessed. Striping, or breaking data into chunks stored upon multiple drives which must be assemble in order to access the data, is a possible solution to physical drive theft, provided that the drives are stored in multiple, individually secured locations, and are enough in number that no one drive can be used to piece together meaningful information. Not to be neglected is the process of adding physical barriers to the storage devices themselves. Locked cases or physically hidden drives, with a limited number of personnel with knowledge and access to the keys or locations, may prove to be a good first line against physical theft.

At different times in his career, he was involved with lace-making machinery, journalism, Hansom cabs and the promotion of railways, cotton and irrigation in India. Contents 1 Life 2 In London 3 Lobbyist for Indian development 4 Last years 5 Works 6 Family 7 See also 8 Notes 9 External links Life[edit] He was born at Loughborough, Leicestershire, on 20 January 1801, the eldest of the three surviving sons of John Chapman, a clockmaker there. He received his education first at a school kept by Mr. Mowbray, and then under the Rev. T. Stevenson; he taught himself Greek, and paid a French workman of his father's to teach him French. With other young people he was an involved in the establishment of the Loughborough Permanent Library; and by 1817 he was devoting his Sundays to teaching in the Sunday school, and had become secretary of a peace society, and of the Hampden Club, of which his father was president. At this time he was helping his father in his business.[1] About 1822, when Chapman was admitted to the General Baptist church, he was concentrating on the machinery required for the bobbinet trade. He joined his brother William in setting up a factory for the production of this machinery; and in a few years was able to build large premises, with a steam-engine. A supporter of the philosophical radicals, when a riot broke out in Loughborough at the time of the Great Reform Bill, he diverted an attack on the rectory, though the rector was an opponent.[1] In 1832 Chapman visited France to investigate the lace-machine trade there. His own firm was doing a large business, then contraband, with foreign houses. Chapman and others petitioned parliament to repeal the machine exportation laws; but J. & W. Chapman was in 1834 completely ruined.[1] In London[edit] Chapman set off from Loughbrough to London, leaving his wife and children behind. He first worked for mathematical instrument makers, then obtained employment as mathematical tutor, and wrote for the Mechanic's Magazine, of which for a short time he was editor. He became secretary to the Safety Cabriolet and Two-wheel Carriage Company in 1830; in the same year his wife and children joined him in London. He improved the vehicle which Joseph Hansom was then building, in the direction of the later "Hansom cab". A patent for it was granted to him and an investor called Gillett, on 31 December 1836.[1] In 1838 Chapman became deacon and superintendent of the Sunday schools of a Baptist chapel, in Edward Street, that moved in 1840 to Praed Street. About the same time he was helping in the management of the Mechanic's Almanac, the Baptist Examiner, the Shareholder's Advocate, and the Railway Times. At a later period he contributed to The Times, Morning Advertiser, Economist, Daily News, Leader, and other publications.[1] Lobbyist for Indian development[edit] In 1842 Chapman was employed by George Thompson to consider the position of India and its trade and rights; and in 1844 he laid before the Board of Trade's railway department a project for constructing the Great Indian Peninsular Railway. He was treated at first as a visionary, but the Great Indian Peninsular Railway Company was set up, with offices at 3 New Broad Street, London.[1] Matters were put on foot in India by Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet as governor of Bombay, who brought in George Thomas Clark to make an initial survey, to benefit the cotton trade. Chapman's role was to co-ordinate Bombay and London.[2] He landed at Bombay in September 1845 to make preliminary investigations. He returned home in 1846 with his plans and his report completed.[1] Chapman's projected route was submitted to Robert Stephenson, who approved of it. Dissensions among the directors then caused an abrupt severance between Chapman and the company. His claim for payment was submitted for arbitration to the East India Company, and he was paid off with £2,500.[1] Last years[edit] Chapman's activities had obtained for him the support of Richard Cobden, John Bright, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Sir Charles Napier, Herbert Spencer, and others. He visited Loughborough in August 1854. After his return to London, he was suddenly seized with cholera on Sunday, 10 September 1854, and died on the following day, aged 53. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.[1] Works[edit] Chapman's books advertised, in a work by John Chapman the publisher, who was a cousin[3] Chapman issued a pamphlet in October 1847 on the cotton and salt question, entitled Remarks on Mr. Aylwin's Letter, and presented to parliament on behalf of Indian merchants in the Bombay presidency a petition for reform of civil government in India. He pursued inquiries about Indian cotton from 1848 to 1850 in Manchester and other places in preparation for The Cotton and Commerce of India, which he issued on 1 January 1851. He followed it by two papers in the Westminster Review, "The Government of India" (April 1852), and "Our Colonial Empire" (October of the same year).[1] In March 1853, Chapman issued Principles of Indian Reform ... concerning ... the Promotion of India Public Works, which went through a second edition at once; and wrote Baroda and Bombay, a protest against the removal of Colonel James Outram from his post as resident at the Guikwar's court at Baroda; a copy was sent to every Member of Parliament, and Outram was reinstated. Two months later, in May, he wrote an introductory preface, at the request of the Bombay Association, to Civil Administration of the Bombay Presidency by Nowrozjee Furdoonjee (Naoroji Furdunji), a Parsi reformer;[4] his paper, "India and its Finance", appeared in the Westminster Review for July that year; his "Constitutional Reform", in the same pages, in January 1854; and his "Civil Service" in the number for July.[1] A major scheme for the irrigation of India was also being prepared by Chapman, and he was in communication concerning it with the Board of Control. When he died he left an unfinished paper, a review of Humboldt's Sphere and Duties of Government; and almost immediately after his death the government sanction for his irrigation scheme was delivered in full form. His unfinished paper appeared in its incomplete state in the Westminster Review of the next month, October; and the Review reprinted his "Government of India" paper in a subsequent number.[1] Family[edit] In December 1824 Chapman married Mary, daughter of John Wallis, a Loughborough lace manufacturer. His wife and three out of ten children survived him.[1] See also[edit] Aerial Steam Carriage William Samuel Henson John Stringfellow Notes[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m Stephen, Leslie, ed.

Garden Island is a tied island 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from Clarence Point, near the mouth of the Tamar River in Tasmania. It is accessed by a dirt road off Bevic Road, which runs between West Tamar Highway, Kelso and Clarence Point Road. This large area is owned by TasPorts. Garden Island is surrounded on all sides by the Tamar River, an estuary which has been excavated to provide a channel for shipping. The backfill from this dredging was moved towards the shore, and provided easier access by connecting the island. There are no facilities of any type on the island, but it provides productive seawater fishing spots, and a flat and open scenic lookout.[1] There are also plenty of oysters in the estuary, but toxic levels of copper, zinc and cadmium have been found in the oysters.[2] The island was known as Green Island in the early nineteenth century, and used for food storage by the settlement established by Colonel William Paterson in 1804.[3] Coordinates: 41°06′52″S 146°48′52″E﻿ / ﻿41.114573°S 146.814311°E﻿ / -41.114573; 146.814311 References[edit] ^ "Gowrie Park Wilderness Village".

The current building dates from 1420 and has 16th-century additions in the Tudor style, but cellars built in 1156 survive.[2] The inn has a strong connection with the notorious Hawkhurst Gang of smugglers, who used it in the 1730s and 1740s as one of their strongholds: Rye was a thriving port during this period. Some of the smugglers, their mistresses and other characters are reported to haunt the inn. The AA Rosette-winning restaurant serves British and French cuisine and features medieval-style artwork in the interior by the Slade School of Fine Art. It has been owned by Judith Blincow since 1993. Contents 1 Geography 2 History 2.1 Early years 2.2 Later years 3 Architecture and fittings 4 Haunting 5 References 5.1 Notes 5.2 Bibliography 6 External links Geography[edit] The Mermaid Inn is located on Mermaid Street, which was once the town's main road.[3] Mermaid street of present day, must have been the Middle street of 1670. Middle Street used to include the present Mermaid and Middle streets; in fact, the original Middle street was the present Mermaid street, as the Mermaid Inn is described[by whom?] as abutting on the south towards that street. The inn is situated on the north side of Mermaid street, and abutted to Middle Street towards the south.[4] Other close-by establishments, which were also used by the Hawkhurst Gang, included the London Trader Inn, the Flushing Inn, and the Olde Bell Inn.[5] History[edit] Passage leading to the courtyard Early years[edit] The cellars of the Mermaid Inn date from 1156, believed to be the year that the original inn was built,[6] or shortly afterwards: Nikolaus Pevsner and English Heritage identified them as 13th-century.[7][8] In its original form, the building was constructed of wattle and daub, lath and plaster. It was a notable alehouse during medieval times, brewing its own ale and charging a penny a night for lodging.[2] The inn became popular with sailors who came to the port of Rye, and the port also provided ships for the Cinque Ports Fleet.[2] In the 1420s, the inn was rebuilt but retained its cellars.[6] It underwent further renovation in the 16th century, much of which remains today.[2][9] Catholic priests who had fled from Continental Europe escaping from the Reformation during 1530 stayed in the inn, which is testified by j.h.s. (Jesus Homnium Salvator) inscribed in the oak-panelled "Syn's Lounge". Between 1550 and 1570, the Town Corporation organised many functions such as the "Sessions Dinner", the "Gentlemens Freeman's Dinner", "Mayoring Day" and the "Herring Feast".[2] Queen Elizabeth I was also a guest at the inn around this time.[6] The inn had a strong connection with the notorious Hawkhurst Gang which used the premises during the 1730s and 1740s.[10] This large group of smugglers controlled territory from Kent to Dorset from their base at the Oak and Ivy Inn in Hawkhurst, but they used the Mermaid Inn as a secondary location.[10] There are a myriad of secret tunnels,[11] including one which ran from the cellars to the Old Bell Inn (built 1390) in The Mint, a street which runs parallel to the north of Mermaid Street. A revolving cupboard at the end of the tunnel in the Olde Bell would then be used by the gang for a quick getaway.[11] A resident of Rye remembered the smugglers as; "when the Hawkhurst Gang were at the height of their pride and insolence having seen them (after successfully running a cargo of goods on the seashore), seated at the windows of this house (the Mermaid) carousing and smoking their pipes, with their loaded pistols lying on the table before them; no magistrate daring to interfere with them".[2] By 1770, the building ceased functioning as an inn.[12] By 1847, it was in use as a house and was owned by Charles Poile; the yard at the back, through which there was a footway leading to High Street, was called the Mermaid Yard.[4] Later years[edit] The inn functioned as a club in 1913, after it came under the ownership of May Aldington, mother of the novelist Richard Aldington. It was then a popular locale for many artists like Dame Ellen Terry, Lord Alfred Douglas (Oscar Wilde's "Bosie"), A.C. and E.F. Benson and Rupert Brooke.[2] In 1945, during World War II, the inn functioned as a garrison for Canadian officers. It was later purchased by Mr L. Wilson, a Canadian, who had been garrisoned there.[2] The Mermaid Inn had the honour of hosting a luncheon to Her Majesty the Queen Mother when she was named as the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports during her visit to Rye in 1982.[2] Under the name Mermaid House and The Mermaid Hotel, the Mermaid Inn was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 12 October 1951.[7] This defines it as a "particularly important" building of "more than special interest".[13] As of February 2001, it was one of 75 Grade II* listed buildings, and 2,106 listed buildings of all grades, in Rother—the local government district in which Rye is located.[14] The Mermaid Inn is presently owned by Judith Blincow and Robert Pinwill, who bought it in 1993.[2] In late 1982, the exterior of the inn was used in the post Monty Python film Yellowbeard, alongside its neighboring church square and infamous cobbled Mermaid Street leading to the inn. The film turned out to be Marty Feldman's last ever project, after he died in Mexico during production. Architecture and fittings[edit] The black and white timber-framed and tiled building, with dark oak and carved stone chimney pieces,[6][15] was constructed in the mid-15th century;[7] the author of Old Sussex Inns identifies 1426 as the date.[6] Some of the timber was taken from ships that had been broken up.[6] The south-facing elevation, the oldest section apart from the cellars, has a five-window range to the upper storey and attic space above. The upper storey is jettied, and the section to the west extends over the entrance to the inner courtyard and former stable area. This overhang is supported on wooden columns with brackets and cross-beams.[7][8] The north-facing section, beyond courtyard, is also timber-framed but with brick facing and infilling. It rises to two storeys with two windows on each and a dormer above.[7] This, and the east and west ranges, are 16th-[8] and 18th-century.[7] The tiled roof has one gable end.[7] The chimney is made of Caen stone and embellished with decorations. The secret passages that existed in the inn have now been converted into fireplaces. The Giant's Fireplace Bar features an inglenook fireplace which is supported by a beam that traverses the room.[16] Other low panelled rooms, contain large Tudor[7] fireplaces and dog grates (a freestanding basket grate intended to hold wood for the fireplace). Monogram, names and dates are carved on the stone fireplaces, including "1643", "1646", and "Loffelholtz".[17] Some of the chairs are elaborately carved and were made from ships' timbers.[6] There are 31 rooms, each of different design, spread over several floors.[18][19] Eight bedrooms have 4-poster beds. The bathrooms are fitted with modern amenities. The ceiling has thick and dark teak wood beams while the windows are made of lead frames. Diamond-paned windows are situated at the back.[15] The floors creak. Haunting[edit] Entrance hall Dining room The Mermaid Inn is well known for its hauntings and has been subject to an investigation by Most Haunted. The events in one room have been described as "one of the most well-organised ghostly scenarios anywhere".[20] Room 1 (James) is said to be haunted by a lady in white or grey who sits in the chair by the fireplace. Guests have reported waking up in the morning and finding their clothes on the chair wet, despite no windows or pipework being near the chair.[21] Room 10 (Fleur de Lys) is said to be haunted by the ghost of a man who has terrified guests by walking through the bathroom wall into the main room.[21] Room 16 (Elizabethan) was said to be the scene of a duel involving two men "of unknown date and origin"[20] (although they have also been described as wearing "16th-century clothing").[6] After fighting through some of the nearby rooms, one of the men was killed, dragged into the adjacent room and thrown through a trapdoor into the dungeon below.[6][20] Many unexplained light anomalies have been recorded in the middle of the night. On one occasion an employee was tending to the fireplace when all of the bottles on the bottle shelf at the other end of the room fell off; the experience caused him to resign.[21] The ghost of a maid is said to be present in the inn; she was the girlfriend of one of the smugglers of the Hawkhurst Gang and was killed by his fellow gang members as they feared she knew too much and would expose them. Room 17 (Kingsmill) is named after Thomas Kingsmill, a Hawkhurst smuggler who inhabited the inn. It is said to be haunted by the ghost of a woman who was said to be the wife of the Hawkhurst gang founder George Gray. She was said to haunt a rocking chair in the room; guests would wake up in the middle of the night and see the chair rocking on its own, and found the room icy cold.[21] The chair was eventually removed from the premises because it caused so many disturbances with guests. Room 19 (Hawkhurst) is said to be haunted by a gentleman in old-fashioned clothes. One American guest reported seeing him sitting at the end of her bed: in terror, she spent the night in the adjacent room with a mattress pulled around her head.[21] Judith Blincow, who owns the inn and has worked there since 1980, states, "Although I have not personally seen ghosts, I certainly have met some very convinced and frightened guests."[22] References[edit] Notes[edit] ^ Holloway 1847, p. 327. harvnb error: multiple targets (2×): CITEREFHolloway1847 (help) ^ a b c d e f g h i j "History of the Mermaid Inn".

The HothouseWritten byHarold PinterCharactersRooteGibbsLambMiss CuttsLushTubbLobbDate premieredApril 1980Place premieredHampstead Theatre, LondonOriginal languageEnglishGenreTragicomedySettingVarious locations within a mental institutionOfficial site The Hothouse (1958/1980) is a full-length tragicomedy written by Harold Pinter in the winter of 1958 between The Birthday Party (1957) and The Caretaker (1959). After writing The Hothouse in the winter of 1958 and following the initial commercial failure of The Birthday Party, Pinter put the play aside; in 1979 he re-read it and directed its first production, at Hampstead Theatre, where it opened on 24 April 1980, transferring to the Ambassadors Theatre on 25 June 1980, and it was first published, also in 1980, by Eyre Methuen.[1] The play received its American premiere at the Trinity Repertory Company in 1982.[2] Pinter himself played Roote in a subsequent production staged at the Minerva Theatre, in Chichester, in 1995, later transferring to the Comedy Theatre, in London.[3] Contents 1 Setting 2 Plot 3 List of characters 4 Critical reception and interpretation 5 Productions 5.1 World premiere 5.2 American premiere 5.3 London revivals 6 Notes 7 Further reading 8 External links Setting[edit] The play is set in an institution whose nature is subject to interpretation; throughout the play, it is ambiguously referred to as both a "rest home" and a "sanitorium" but its "residents" or "patients" are designated anonymously by numbers, not by their names. Plot[edit] The professionalism and even sanity of the institution's director, Roote, are undermined by his subordinates: the efficient and ambitious Gibbs, the aptly named alcoholic Lush, and Miss Cutts, Roote's calculating and shrewd mistress who is also involved with Gibbs. After the reported murder of one patient and the rape and resulting pregnancy of another, Roote orders Gibbs to find the perpetrator(s), who it appears is Roote himself, and Gibbs supplants his boss as administrator of the corrupt "rest home", whose inmates converge upon the staff, resulting in mayhem.

He represented Harbour Main from 1904 to 1908 and from 1921 to 1922 in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly as a Liberal. He was born in Holyrood, the son of Philip Lewis and Mary O'Keefe, and was educated there. Lewis married Elizabeth Veitch. He was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1908, 1909 and 1913. Lewis served as Newfoundland commercial agent in Spain in 1920. He was reelected in a 1921 by-election. He died of typhoid fever in Naples in 1922 while travelling as a representative of A.E. Hickman & Co. in Italy. His son Philip later served in the Newfoundland assembly. References[edit] Smallwood, Joseph R (1991). Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador. v. 3. p. 285.

Jeffrey is an American former college athlete and coach. He played college football at the University of Missouri for one season before transferring to Baylor University where he participated in both football and baseball. Jeffrey was also the first baseball head coach of Southwest Texas State University (now known as Texas State University–San Marcos) in their transition to NCAA Division I competition in 1985. Contents 1 Playing career 2 Coaching career 2.1 Head coaching record 3 Later life and personal 4 References 5 External links Playing career[edit] Jeffrey was a standout athlete at Shawnee Mission West High School in Overland Park, Kansas.[1] When picking the university where he would want to continue his football career, Missouri and Baylor were his first and second choices, respectively, even though his older brother Neal had previously been a star quarterback at Baylor.[1] Jeffrey enrolled at Mizzou in the fall of 1977. He did not play during his freshman season. After backing up starting quarterback Phil Bradley during his entire sophomore season in 1978, he grew discontented and looked to transfer.[2] Jeffrey called Baylor head coach Grant Teaff and was told he would have to earn the starting job, but he transferred anyway.[2] Due to NCAA bylaws pertaining to transferring, Jeffrey had to sit out the 1979 season. He then beat out the other quarterbacks to earn the starting job for the 1980 season and guided the Bears to a Southwest Conference championship with a 10–1 record.[2][3] The Bears reached a #6 national ranking heading into the 1981 Cotton Bowl Classic against #9 Alabama. The Crimson Tide, led by Hall of Fame coach Bear Bryant, won the game 30 to 2, however, and Baylor ended their season with a 10–2 overall record.[2] The following season, Jeffrey's last, did not duplicate the success of the 1980 season. The Bears finished with a 5–6 overall record and tied for sixth place in the conference. Along with playing football, Jeffrey also suited up for the Baylor baseball team during his final two years at the school.[2] In his junior year he played shortstop while in his senior year he was a left fielder.[2] Once his college athletic career ended in the spring of 1982, Jeffrey was finished as an athlete.[2] Coaching career[edit] Jeffrey graduated from school in the spring of 1982 and followed former Baylor football assistant John O'Hara to Southwest Texas State University.[2] He served as the quarterbacks and wide receivers coach through the 1986 season. While at Southwest Texas State, Jeffrey also became the baseball team's head coach for the 1985 and 1986 seasons.[2][4] The 1985 season marked the school's first ever as a Division I member.[4] He compiled an overall record of 60 wins and 52 losses in two years as the head coach.

It has been operating for over ninety years since the 1929–30 season. It had been organized by Lega Calcio until 2010, when the Lega Serie B was created for the 2010–11 season. Common nicknames for the league are campionato cadetto and cadetteria, as cadetto is the Italian for junior or cadet.

If the first ones won the championship, they would be promoted to First Category, which consequently improved in size: the first team to reach the honour, was Pro Vercelli in 1907, which even won the scudetto in 1908. FIGC attempted many times to introduce relegations on the contrary, but the reform was really adopted only in 1921 by the secessionist CCI in its Northern League, which consisted of a First Division and a Second Division: the first teams to be relegated were AC Vicenza and FC Inter even if, after the reunion with FIGC, the regulations were changed, and Venezia was demoted instead of the Milanese club. Even if part of the same league, differently from First Division, Second Division was based on local group with proximity criteria. Only in 1928, the big reform was conceived by FIGC's President Leandro Arpinati: after a year, a new second division based on the same national format of the major tournament would be born. Serie B began in 1929 with 18 clubs and continued until World War II after whom it was divided again between the northern and the southern part of the country, due to the destructions of the war. The championship became national again in 1948, and for many years in the second half of the 20th century, it was played by 20 clubs. In 2003–04 a single group of 24 teams was formed, the biggest in the history of all levels of the Italian championship. After 2004, a 22-teams format was introduced together with playoffs. After Serie A split with Serie B to form Lega Serie A, Lega Serie B was formed on 7 July 2010. The league signed a new sponsor bwin for 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons; changed the league name from Serie B TIM to Serie Bwin.[2] The League changed again its name in Serie B ConTe.it due to sponsorship reasons.[3] Serie B is the lowest division where five clubs have ever played: Torino, Juventus, Milan, Roma and Lazio. Serie B introduced the "green card" at the beginning of the 2015–16 season. The green card is given to promote fair play and good acts. The green card will not be given during the game, as it would alter sport rules, but awarded after the match to a player or coach who exhibited fair play by the referee. The player or coach with the most green cards at the end of the season will be rewarded.[4] Format, promotion and relegation[edit] At the end of the season, three teams are promoted to Serie A and four teams are relegated to Serie C. The top two teams are automatically promoted. If the 3rd-placed team is 10 or more points ahead of the 4th-placed team, it is automatically promoted too, otherwise a playoff tournament determines the third team that will be ascending. In the 2013–14 season, anywhere between two and six teams within a "playoff margin" of 14 points from the 3rd-placed team will enter the playoff tournament. Under the new playoff format, up to three rounds may be required. The final two rounds are two-legged ties, while opening round matches (if required) are single legs hosted by the higher-ranked team. If a tie is drawn at the end of regular play (one or two matches, depending on the round), extra time is played. If the two teams are still tied after thirty minutes, the higher classified team advances. In the relegation zone, the three last-placed teams (18th, 19th and 20th) are automatically demoted to Serie C. If the 16th-placed team is 5 or more points ahead of the 17th-placed team, then the 17th-placed team becomes the 4th and final team to be demoted, otherwise the conditions for a playoff more commonly called playout exist. If the playout is necessary, the 16th and 17th-placed teams are paired in a two-legged series with home-field advantage in the 2nd leg going to the 16th-placed team. The team with the higher aggregate score remains in Serie B while the loser becomes the fourth team relegated to Serie C. If an aggregate tie exists at the end of regulation play of the 2nd leg, the 16th-placed team is saved, and the 17th-placed team is demoted, unless the two teams ended the season with equal points, in which case there will be extra-time and a penalty shoot-out if still tied. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league's history; 18 clubs: 1929–1933 26 clubs (in two groups): 1933–1934 32 clubs (in two groups): 1934–1935 18 clubs: 1935–1936 16 clubs: 1936–1937 17 clubs: 1937–1938 18 clubs: 1938–1943 60 clubs (in three groups): 1946–1947 54 clubs (in three groups): 1947–1948 22 clubs: 1948–1950 21 clubs: 1950–1951 22 clubs: 1951–1952 18 clubs: 1952–1958 20 clubs: 1958–1967 21 clubs: 1967–1968 20 clubs: 1968–2003 24 clubs: 2003–2004 22 clubs: 2004–2018 19 clubs: 2018–2019 20 clubs: 2019– Serie B was composed of 20 teams until the 2002–03 season. It was enlarged to 24 teams for the 2003–04 season due to legal problems relating to Calcio Catania relegation. The league reverted to 22 teams for the 2004–05 season, while Serie A expanded from 18 to 20 teams. During the regular season, each team plays 38 games – two games against every opponent. In Italian football, a true round-robin format is used. In the first half of the season, called andata, each team plays once against all its opponents, a total of 19 games. In the second half of the season, called ritorno, each team will play the same teams in exactly the same order, the only difference being that a home game played in the first half will be an away game with that same team in the second half, and vice versa. Since the 2006–07 season, the Serie B champion is awarded the cup Ali della Vittoria (Wings of Victory). The trophy is 63 cm high and weighs 5 kg. Its structure represents the wings of the goddess Nike, the goddess of victory, holding a cup similar to an Olympic flame.

Mosaic from the Monastery of Hosios Loukas. Luke of Steiris, Luke Thaumaturgus, Luke the Younger, Luke of Hellas, or Luke the Wonder-worker (896 — 953 AD) was a Byzantine saint of the tenth century AD who lived in the themes (provinces) of Hellas and Peloponnese in Greece, and who founded the Monastery of Hosios Loukas (Venerable Luke) on the slopes of Mount Helicon, between Delphi and Levadia, near the coast of the Gulf of Corinth in Boeotia, Greece. He was one of the earliest saints to be seen levitating in prayer.[1] The principal source for Luke's life is an anonymous Life written by a monk of Hosios Loukas who had been one of Luke's followers. His feast day is commemorated on February 7,[2] and the translation of his relics on May 3.[3] His relics are preserved in his monastery of Hosios Loukas. Contents 1 Life 1.1 Childhood 1.2 Asceticism 1.3 Exodus 1.4 Return 2 See also 3 Notes 4 References 5 Sources 6 External links Life[edit] Childhood[edit] The monastery of Hosios Loukas Luke was a native of the Greek village of Kastorion in Phocis.[4] He was the third of the seven children of Stephen and Euphrosyne. The Life, typically for the genre, begins with signs of Luke's closeness to God as a child. For instance, Luke is recorded as having done 'nothing in a childish fashion',[5] and is seen to be close to God when his mother witnesses him levitating in prayer.[6] The son of poor farmers, the saint worked in the fields and tended sheep.[4] As a child Luke tried twice to leave home to seek a solitary life of prayer. The first time, he attempted to withdraw to Thessaly, but was captured by soldiers lying in wait for escaped slaves and was returned home.[7] The second time he had more success, meeting two monks journeying from Rome to Jerusalem[8] who took him to a monastery in Athens where he received the small habit.[9] After Luke's mother prayed for her son's return however, God made her appear in a dream to the abbot and commanded him to return Luke to his home.[10] Asceticism[edit] At the age of 14, with his mother’s blessing, he went to a solitary place on a mountain called Ioannou (or Ioannitza)[4] and for 7 years lived as an ascetic.[11] The Life records with symmetry that during this time Luke received the great habit from two monks travelling from Jerusalem to Rome (presumably the same two from whom he had received the small habit on their outward journey).[12] Luke's fame spread and a number of miracles are ascribed to him during this period, such as revealing to two brothers the location of their dead father's buried treasure.[13] Numerous proofs of Luke's holiness are also given, such as sleeping in a trench to remind himself of death,[14] or being visited in dream by an angel who let a hook down Luke's mouth and 'drew out a certain fleshly member therefrom', freeing him from the temptations of the flesh.[15] Exodus[edit] Luke was forced to leave Ioannitza by an invasion of the Bulgarian emperor Symeon (which Luke had predicted).[16] Luke, followed by the local villagers, fled to a nearby island, almost perishing when attacked by Bulgarians in a stolen ship.[17] After the invaders withdrew, Luke, now aged 21, enrolled in a school in Corinth, but soon left after he found the other students insufficiently serious.[18] Instead, he went to serve a stylite at Zemena for the next ten years, until he was stranded in the Peloponnese on an errand when the harbour master refused to allow him to return to Hellas, fearing raids (whether Bulgarian or Arabic is not mentioned).[19] When Luke was ejected from his oratory in the Peloponnese after a rainstorm, his hagiographer comments that 'God perhaps arranged these things beneficially, lest dwelling too long in the land of Pelops he do an injustice to his fatherland', perhaps indicating a rival cult of the saint in the Peloponnese and providing an interesting example of patriotism towards the theme.[20] Return[edit] The Life also cites Symeon's death in 927 and the succession of his more pacific son Peter as a reason why Luke returned to Ioannitza to build his own community.[21] Luke drew so many followers that he found the distractions unbearable and decided to retreat further into the wilderness.[22] Three years later, however, Luke was displaced again, this time by a Magyar invasion. Just as before, Luke retreated with the local villagers to a nearby island.[23] Once there, Luke found the desert island to be a suitable place to pursue his solitary ascetic life, and stayed for three years, enduring terrible thirsts.[24] Eventually Luke's companions persuaded him to leave, and he settled for the remainder of his life in the far more amenable environment of the present Hosios Loukas, where he founded his hermitage c. 946 AD in the area of Stiris (which may be a corruption of Soterion, or place of healing).[note 1] Here brethren gathered to the elder, and a small monastery grew up, the church of which was dedicated to the Great Martyr Barbara. Dwelling in the monastery, the saint performed many miracles, healing sicknesses of soul and of body.[2][4] See also[edit] Mystical levitation in Christianity Saints and levitation Notes[edit] ^ Midway between Distomo (ancient Ambryssos) and the monastery of Osios Loukas, lies the village of Stiri, which is named after, but does not occupy, the site of ancient Stiris.[25] References[edit] ^ Saint Patrick Catholic Church: Saints of February 7 ^ a b (in Greek) Ὁ Ὅσιος Λουκᾶς ὁ ἐν Στειρίῳ τῆς Ἑλλάδος. 7 Φεβρουαρίου.

Contents 1 Design and description 2 Construction and career 3 References 4 Sources Design and description[edit] In early 1939, with the risk of war with Nazi Germany increasing, it was clear to the Royal Navy that it needed more escort ships to counter the threat from Kriegsmarine U-boats. One particular concern was the need to protect shipping off the east coast of Britain. What was needed was something larger and faster than trawlers, but still cheap enough to be built in large numbers, preferably at small merchant shipyards, as larger yards were already busy. To meet this requirement, the Smiths Dock Company of Middlesbrough, a specialist in the design and build of fishing vessels, offered a development of its 700-ton, 16 knots (18 mph; 30 km/h) whale catcher Southern Pride.[1][2] They were intended as small convoy escort ships that could be produced quickly and cheaply in large numbers. Despite naval planners' intentions that they be deployed for coastal convoys, their long range meant that they became the mainstay of Mid-Ocean Escort Force convoy protection during the first half of the war. The original Flowers had the standard RN layout, consisting of a raised forecastle, a well deck, then the bridge or wheelhouse, and a continuous deck running aft. The crew quarters were in the foc'sle while the galley was at the rear, making for poor messing arrangements.[3] The modified Flowers saw the forecastle extended aft past the bridge to the aft end of the funnel, a variation known as the "long forecastle" design. Apart from providing a very useful space where the whole crew could gather out of the weather, the added weight improved the ships' stability and speed and was retroactively applied to a number of the original Flower-class vessels during the mid and latter years of the war. Construction and career[edit] Snapdragon was laid down by Smith's Dock Company at their shipyard at South Bank, on 27 September 1939 and launched on3 September 1940. She was commissioned on 28 October 1940. HMS Snapdragon was on a mission off Benghazi, Libya when she was expectedly attacked by German Luftwaffe bombers and sank.[4] References[edit] ^ Brown 2007, pp. 41–43. ^ Lambert and Brown 2008, p. 3. ^ Brown D K, Nelson to Vanguard ^ "HMS Snapdragon (K 10) of the Royal Navy - British Corvette of the Flower class - Allied Warships of WWII - uboat.net". uboat.net.

It is part of the municipality of Murcia.[1] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 3 History 4 Festivities 5 References Etymology[edit] Unlike other districts of the region (comarca) Huerta de Murcia and belonging to the municipality of Murcia, the Arab toponym of the territory did not persist.[2] This toponym has a previous historically Spanish variant origin (related to the Spanish language spoken in previous eras). 'Nonduermas' is composed by two words: the grammar negator word of a previous historically Spanish variant 'non' and the word 'duermas', which is the verb 'dormir' conjugated, and it means 'to sleep'. Therefore, this expression is negative imperative and it can be translated as 'Don't sleep' or 'Do not sleep'. The reason for this district name is just hypothesized. One hypothesis is about the toponym to have its origins in the fact that a kind of neighbouring assembly medieval government named concejo, established that the meadows of the territory could be place for traffic for the local shepherds and the foreign shepherds must have been allowed for staying at the territory. Another action of the concejo related to the issue of those meadows was the instructions with the message that lighting camp fires was forbidden. Otherwise the shepherds would be fined. The consequences of that legal regulation and the fines would be the warning 'Non duermas' (Don't sleep). Other hypothesis is related to the danger in travelling through a path, so the locals used to warn the people who were intending to circulate through that path with the expression 'Non duermas'. A third hyphotesis establishes the origin of this toponym in the fact that a group of Christian knights were sent by the king James I of Aragon from Orihuela. They were attack by Muslim forces and the commander of the Christian party advertised this Christian knight group with the expression 'Non duermas'.[2] Geography[edit] The area of this district is approximately 2.755 km2 and its height is around 50 metres. There is a distance of 3 km from the village to the capital of the municipality (the city of Murcia).[3] History[edit] A farmstead whose name is Tel Açaguer or Tell Açegir is theorized to exist in the last half of the 13th century in this current district. In that era, large part of the Iberian Peninsula was governed by Muslim governments due to a Muslim conquer of the peninsula during the 8th century.[2] During the Trienio Liberal (1820-1823), an own local government was established in Non Duermas.[4] There was a constant population growth during the 20th century in this territory.[4] Festivities[edit] Fiestas patronales (Patron saint festivities) in honour of the patroness saint de Cortes: This festivity is held on the first weeks of September. During these festive days some acts such as masses, triduums and flowers offerings to the Virgin are conducted. Other phenomena in this festive ambient are the choirs and the popular dances. There are also acts for young people such as hip hop performances and festive races. In rigard to the children, there are children theatre performances, amusement rides and a temporary outdoor cinema space avoidable for them.[5] References[edit] ^ "Nonduermas - Portal Ayuntamiento de Murcia" (in Spanish).

D. Mullen. The journal is published three times per year at DePauw University. As the name implies, the journal publishes articles and book reviews on science fiction, but also occasionally on fantasy and horror when the topic also covers some aspect of science fiction as well. Known as one of the major academic publications of its type, Science Fiction Studies is considered the most "theoretical" of the academic journals that publish on science fiction. Contents 1 History 2 Peer review 3 Format 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History[edit] A still from Voyage a la Lune—this image is also the logo of the Science Fiction Studies journal. SFS has had three different institutional homes during its lifetime. It was founded in 1973 at Indiana State University by the late English professor Dr. R. D. Mullen, where it remained for approximately five years. In 1978, it moved to McGill University and then to Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, where it was supported by a Canadian government grant until 1991. SFS was brought back to Indiana to DePauw University in 1992 where it has remained ever since. The parent company of SFS is SF-TH Inc., a not-for-profit corporation established under the laws of the State of Indiana. Dr. Arthur B. Evans (DePauw University) serves as president of SF-TH Inc. and managing editor of SFS. The other senior editors of SFS are Dr. Istvan Csicsery-Ronay (DePauw University), Dr. Joan Gordon (Nassau Community College), Dr. Veronica Hollinger (Trent University), Dr. Carol McGuirk (Florida Atlantic University), Dr. Lisa Swanstrom (University of Utah), and Dr. Sherryl Vint (University of California at Riverside). Peer review[edit] SFS is refereed, very selective (its acceptance rate averages around 37%), and its 900+ subscription base includes institutions and individuals in the US and Canada and more than 30 foreign countries. SFS has been called the world’s most respected journal for the critical study of science fiction. Recognized as having brought a rigorous theoretical focus to the study of this popular genre, SFS has been featured in The Chronicle of Higher Education, where Jim Zook noted that "Since its founding... Science Fiction Studies has charted the course for the most hard-core science fiction critics and comparatists. That focus has earned the journal its reputation as the most theoretical scholarly publication in the field, as well as the most daring".[1] SFS has also been reviewed in the Times Literary Supplement, where Paul Kincaid compared the world’s three principal learned journals that focus on science fiction: Science Fiction Studies, Extrapolation (published at the University of Texas, Brownsville), and Foundation (published at the University of Liverpool, UK). He concluded that "Science Fiction Studies ... has always been resolutely academic, the articles always peer-reviewed ..., and with an uncompromising approach to the complexities of critical theory".[2] On top of being the most theoretically sophisticated journal in the field, SFS also has the broadest coverage of science fiction outside the English language, with special issues on Science Fiction in France, Post-Soviet SF, Japanese SF, and Latin American SF. Format[edit] SFS appears three times per year (March, July, and November) and averages 200 pages in length. A representative issue contains 5–8 articles ranging in length from 5,000 to 15,000 words, 2–3 review-essays, two dozen book reviews covering scholarly works, plus a substantial Notes and Correspondence section. Special issues follow the same format but are usually guest-edited. Recent special issue topics include Technoculture and Science Fiction, Afrofuturism, Latin American Science Fiction, Animal Studies and Science Fiction, Science Fiction and Sexuality, Italian Science Fiction, Digital Science Fiction, and Spanish Science Fiction, among others. A regular rotation of open and special issues has characterized the journal’s publication schedule from the outset: roughly one-third of its 130+ issues have been special issues. These special issues often have a major impact on the field, setting critical agendas and initiating debates. Guest editors are drawn from the consulting board of 35 scholars, representing in their expertise the international scope of the field. SFS offers both print and electronic subscriptions (the latter through JSTOR) via the SFS Store on its website. A subscription is also included with membership in the Science Fiction Research Association.

Bric-à-brac for sale at a street market in Cambridge Bric-à-brac (French: [bʁi.ka.bʁak]) or bric-a-brac (from French),[1] first used in the Victorian era,[2] refers to lesser objets d'art forming collections of curios, such as elaborately decorated teacups and small vases, compositions of feathers or wax flowers under glass domes, decorated eggshells, porcelain figurines, painted miniatures or photographs in stand-up frames, and so on. In middle-class homes bric-à-brac was used as ornament on mantelpieces, tables, and shelves, or was displayed in curio cabinets: sometimes these cabinets have glass doors to display the items within while protecting them from dust. Today, bric-à-brac refers to a selection of items of modest value, often sold in street markets and charity shops, and may be more commonly known in colloquial English as "knick knacks". In Yiddish such items are known as tchotchkes. Edith Wharton and Ogden Codman Jr., in The Decoration of Houses (1897), distinguished three gradations of quality in such "household ornaments": bric-à-brac, bibelots (trinkets) and objets d'art.[3] See also[edit] Antique shop Discount store Staffordshire dog figurine Variety store References[edit] ^ Online Etymology Dictionary ^ OED first reference in English: 1840. ^ "French speech... has provided at least three designations, each indicating a delicate and almost imperceptible gradation of quality": Wharton and Codman, The Decoration of Houses, 1897, Ch.

The play concerns the socialite and novelist Charles Condomine, who invites the eccentric medium and clairvoyant, Madame Arcati, to his house to conduct a séance, hoping to gather material for his next book. The scheme backfires when he is haunted by the ghost of his annoying and temperamental first wife, Elvira, after the séance. Elvira makes continual attempts to disrupt Charles's marriage to his second wife, Ruth, who cannot see or hear the ghost. The play was first seen in the West End in 1941, creating a new long-run record for non-musical British plays of 1,997 performances. It also did well on Broadway later that year, running for 657 performances. Coward adapted the play for film in 1945, starring Rex Harrison, and directed a musical adaptation, High Spirits, on Broadway in 1964. It was also adapted for television in the 1950s and 1960s and for radio. The play enjoyed several West End and Broadway revivals in the 1970s and 1980s and was revived again in London in 2004, 2011, 2014 and 2020. It returned to Broadway in February 2009.

His first thoughts centred on an old house in Paris, haunted by spectres from different centuries, with the comedy arising from their conflicting attitudes, but he could not get the plot to work in his mind.[2] He knew that in wartime Britain, with death a constant presence, there would be some objection to a comedy about ghosts,[3] but his firm view was that as the story would be thoroughly heartless, "you can't sympathise with any of them. If there was a heart it would be a sad story."[2] After his London office and flat had been destroyed in the Blitz, Coward took a short holiday with the actress Joyce Carey at Portmeirion on the coast of Snowdonia in Wales. She was writing a play about Keats, and he was still thinking about his ghostly light comedy: We sat on the beach with our backs against the sea wall and discussed my idea exclusively for several hours. Keats, I regret to say, was not referred to. By lunchtime the title had emerged together with the names of the characters, and a rough, very rough, outline of the plot. At seven-thirty the next morning I sat, with the usual nervous palpitations, at my typewriter. Joyce was upstairs in her room wrestling with Fanny Brawne. There was a pile of virgin paper on my left and a box of carbons on my right. The table wobbled and I had to put a wedge under one of its legs. I smoked several cigarettes in rapid succession, staring gloomily out of the window at the tide running out. I fixed the paper into the machine and started. Blithe Spirit. A Light Comedy in Three Acts. For six days I worked from eight to one each morning and from two to seven each afternoon. On Friday evening, May ninth, the play was finished and, disdaining archness and false modesty, I will admit that I knew it was witty, I knew it was well constructed, and I also knew that it would be a success.[4] Synopsis[edit] Charles Condomine, a successful novelist, wishes to learn about the occult for a novel he is writing, and he arranges for an eccentric medium, Madame Arcati, to hold a séance at his house. At the séance, she inadvertently summons Charles's first wife, Elvira, who has been dead for seven years. Madame Arcati leaves after the séance, unaware that she has summoned Elvira. Only Charles can see or hear Elvira, and his second wife, Ruth, does not believe that Elvira exists until a floating vase is handed to her out of thin air. Elvira is appealingly decadent, unconventional and moody, in contrast to the more strait-laced Ruth. The ghostly Elvira makes continued, and increasingly desperate, efforts to disrupt Charles's current marriage. She finally sabotages his car in the hope of killing him so that he will join her in the spirit world, but it is Ruth rather than Charles who drives off and is killed. Ruth's ghost immediately comes back for revenge on Elvira, and though Charles cannot at first see Ruth, he can see that Elvira is being chased and tormented, and his house is in uproar. He calls Madame Arcati back to exorcise both of the spirits, but instead of banishing them she unintentionally materialises Ruth. With both his dead wives now fully visible, and neither of them in the best of tempers, Charles, together with Madame Arcati, goes through séance after séance and spell after spell to try to exorcise them. It is not until Madame Arcati works out that the housemaid, Edith, is psychic and had unwittingly been the conduit through which Elvira was summoned that she succeeds in dematerialising both ghosts. Charles is left seemingly in peace, but Madame Arcati, hinting that the ghosts may still be around unseen, warns him that he should go far away as soon as possible. Coward repeats one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the central character tiptoes out as the curtain falls – a device that he also used in Present Laughter, Private Lives and Hay Fever.[5] Charles leaves at once, and the unseen ghosts throw things and destroy the room as soon as he has gone. (In the David Lean film version, the ghosts thwart Charles's attempt to escape, and his car is again sabotaged; he crashes and joins them as a ghost, with Elvira at one arm and Ruth at the other.) Roles and original cast[edit] The original West End cast was as follows: Charles Condomine – Cecil Parker Ruth Condomine, his second wife – Fay Compton Elvira Condomine, his first wife and ghostly presence – Kay Hammond Madame Arcati, a medium – Margaret Rutherford Doctor Bradman, a friend – Martin Lewis Mrs Bradman, his wife – Moya Nugent Edith, a maid – Ruth Reeves Productions[edit] The play was first produced at the Manchester Opera House in June 1941, and then premiered in the West End at the Piccadilly Theatre on 2 July 1941,[6] later transferring to the St James's Theatre and then the Duchess Theatre, for a total of 1,997 performances.[7][8] It was directed by Coward; sets and costumes were designed by Gladys Calthrop.[9] During the run Beryl Measor took over as Madame Arcati and Irene Browne took over the role of Ruth.[8] When the play transferred from the Piccadilly to the St James's in 1942, Coward took over the role of Charles for a time.[10] The run set a record for non-musical plays in the West End that was not surpassed until 1957 by The Mousetrap.[11] The Broadway premiere was on 5 November 1941 at the Morosco Theatre in a production staged by John C. Wilson and designed by Stewart Chaney. In the cast were Clifton Webb as Charles, Peggy Wood as Ruth, Leonora Corbett as Elvira and Mildred Natwick as Madame Arcati. The play transferred to the Booth Theatre on 18 May 1942; it ran for a total of 657 performances.[12] Coward starred as Charles in a wartime UK touring company, beginning in September 1942, with Joyce Carey as Ruth, Judy Campbell as Elvira and Molly Johnson as Madame Arcati.[13] Dennis Price covered for Coward when the latter was taken ill.[14] Another wartime touring company, run by ENSA, toured the Far East in 1945, headed by John Gielgud, who directed, and played Charles.[15] 1970s and 1980s[edit] In July 1970, the play was revived in the West End at the Globe Theatre, starring Patrick Cargill as Charles, Phyllis Calvert as Ruth, Amanda Reiss as Elvira and Beryl Reid as Madame Arcati; it ran until January 1971.[16] It was revived by the National Theatre in 1976 in a production directed by Harold Pinter, starring Richard Johnson as Charles, Rowena Cooper as Ruth, Maria Aitken as Elvira and Elizabeth Spriggs as Madame Arcati.[17] Another London revival played in 1986 at the Vaudeville Theatre, starring Simon Cadell as Charles, Jane Asher as Ruth, Joanna Lumley as Elvira and Marcia Warren as Madame Arcati.[18] Blithe Spirit was revived on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre on 31 March 1987 in a production directed by Brian Murray. It starred Richard Chamberlain as Charles, Judith Ivey as Ruth, Blythe Danner as Elvira and Geraldine Page as Madame Arcati. It ran for 104 performances. Page, who received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress, died of a heart attack during the run;[19] Patricia Conolly succeeded her in the role.[20] 2000s[edit] In 2002 the play was given a short production at the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York, with Daniel Gerroll, who also directed, as Charles, Patricia Kalember as Ruth, Twiggy as Elvira and Dana Ivey as Madame Arcati.[21] The piece was back in the West End at the Savoy Theatre in 2004, in a production directed by Thea Sharrock, starring Aden Gillett as Charles, Joanna Riding as Ruth, Amanda Drew as Elvira and Penelope Keith (succeeded by Stephanie Cole) as Madame Arcati.[22] A Broadway revival played in 2009 at the Shubert Theatre.[23] Michael Blakemore directed, with Rupert Everett as Charles, Jayne Atkinson as Ruth, Christine Ebersole as Elvira, Angela Lansbury as Madame Arcati and Simon Jones as Dr Bradman.[24] The New York Times found the revival somewhat uneven, calling the opening performance "bumpy", but praised Lansbury's performance.[n 1] 2010s[edit] Sharrock directed a revival of her production of the play, which started as a UK tour[27] and then moved to the Apollo Theatre, London. It ran there from March to June 2011, with a cast including Robert Bathurst as Charles, Hermione Norris as Ruth, Ruthie Henshall as Elvira and Alison Steadman as Madame Arcati.[28] A West End production, directed by Blakemore, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in March 2014, with Charles Edwards as Charles, Janie Dee as Ruth, Jemima Rooper as Elvira and Lansbury as Madame Arcati, and Jones as Dr Bradman as in Blakemore's 2009 Broadway production. It ran until June.[29] A revival, again directed by Blakemore with most of the West End cast (including Lansbury at age 89) except Charlotte Parry as Ruth, toured North America from December 2014 to March 2015, visiting Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington D.C..[30][31] Critical reception[edit] After the first performance in Manchester, the reviewer in The Manchester Guardian thought the mixture of farce and impending tragedy "An odd mixture and not untouched by genius of a sort".[32] After the London premiere, Ivor Brown commented in The Observer on the skill with which Coward had treated his potentially difficult subject; he ended his notice, "But here is a new play, a gay play, and one irresistibly propelled into our welcoming hearts by Miss Rutherford's Lady of the Trances, as rapt a servant of the séance as ever had spirits on tap."[33] The London correspondent of The Guardian wrote, "London received Mr Noel Coward's ghoulish farce with loud, though not quite unanimous acclaim. There was a solitary boo – from an annoyed spiritualist, presumably."[34] The Times considered the piece the equal not only of Coward's earlier success Hay Fever but of Wilde's classic comedy The Importance of Being Earnest.[35] There were dissenting views. James Agate thought the play "common",[36] and Graham Greene called it "a wearisome exhibition of bad taste".[37] When the piece had its first West End revival in 1970 the play was warmly though not rapturously praised by the critics,[37][38] but by the time of the next major production, in 1976, Irving Wardle of The Times considered, "Stylistically, it is Coward's masterpiece: his most complete success in imposing his own view of things on the brute facts of existence,"[39] and Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote of Coward's influence on Harold Pinter.[17] In 2004, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, "With Hay Fever and Private Lives, Blithe Spirit strikes me as being one of Coward 's three indisputable comic masterpieces. [It is] the outrageous frivolity with which Coward treats mortality that makes the piece so bracing."[40] Adaptations[edit] Film[edit] Blithe Spirit was made into a 1945 film adapted by Coward and directed by David Lean. The cast included Rex Harrison as Charles, Constance Cummings as Ruth, Kay Hammond as Elvira and Margaret Rutherford as Madame Arcati.[41] It has also been adapted as an upcoming 2020 film directed by Edward Hall, with Dan Stevens as Charles, Isla Fisher as Ruth, Leslie Mann as Elvira and Judi Dench as Madame Arcati.[42] Television[edit] An American television adaptation was broadcast in 1946, with Philip Tonge as Charles, Carol Goodner as Ruth, Leonora Corbett as Elvira and Estelle Winwood as Madame Arcati.[43] In Britain, BBC television broadcast a production in 1948, directed by George More O'Ferrall, with Frank Lawton as Charles, Marian Spencer as Ruth, Betty Ann Davies as Elvira and Beryl Measor reprising her stage role of Madame Arcati.[44] Coward directed a 14 January 1956, live American television adaptation for the Ford Star Jubilee series, in which he also starred as Charles, with Claudette Colbert as Ruth, Lauren Bacall as Elvira and Mildred Natwick as Madame Arcati.[45] A British commercial television adaptation in 1964 was directed by Joan Kemp-Welch, with Griffith Jones as Charles, Helen Cherry as Ruth, Joanna Dunham as Elvira and Hattie Jacques as Madame Arcati.[46] Another American television TV production was presented in 1966 on the Hallmark Hall of Fame, with Dirk Bogarde as Charles, Rachel Roberts as Ruth, Rosemary Harris as Elvira and Ruth Gordon as Madame Arcati.[47] Radio[edit] BBC Radio's broadcasts of the play include a 1983 version with Paul Eddington as Charles, Julia McKenzie as Ruth, Anna Massey as Elvira and Peggy Mount as Madame Arcati.[48] In December 2008 a BBC radio adaptation was made by Bert Coules, with Roger Allam as Charles, Hermione Gulliford as Ruth, Zoe Waites as Elvira and Maggie Steed as Madame Arcati.[49] In December 2014, an adaptation of the play by Sean O'Connor was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as part of an episode of The Archers, with the characters from the series playing the roles in Blithe Spirit.[50] Musical[edit] The play was adapted into the musical High Spirits in 1964, with book, music and lyrics by Hugh Martin and Timothy Gray. It had a Broadway run of 375 performances, starring Edward Woodward as Charles, Louise Troy as Ruth, Tammy Grimes as Elvira and Beatrice Lillie as Madame Arcati. It had a three-month West End run in 1964–1965, with Denis Quilley as Charles, Jan Walters as Ruth, Marti Stevens as Elvira and Cicely Courtneidge as Madame Arcati.[51] Notes and references[edit] Note ^ The production won several awards. Lansbury won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress.[25] The play won the Drama League Award for Distinguished Revival of a Play.[26] References ^ Nightingale, Benedict.

(April 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The footballers adopted a variant of the brigade emblem of the Luftlandebrigade 26.The Rote Jäger (Red Hunters) were a short-lived German military football club active during World War II (August 1943 – November 1944). The team was assembled by Hermann Graf, a fighter ace and commander of German fighter pilots. Based near Hamburg, the unit developed into a refuge from service on the Eastern front for some German national team players. Contents 1 History 2 Postwar re-establishment 3 The squad (1943–45) 4 References History[edit] Unlike some other military teams, such as Luftwaffen-SV Hamburg, the side did not participate in regular German league play or take part in national championship play, but instead staged a series of exhibition matches in Germany, as well as a few in Hungary, Alsace (France), and Poland. The genesis of the team was in a challenge made by an elite Romanian army side to Graf, who managed the German military side in the country. Graf trained with Germany's national side before the war and he decided to contact his former coach, Sepp Herberger, who – to the surprise of the Romanians – brought along several members of the side to take part in the match, which the Germans won 3:2 in front of 40,000 in Bucharest. By 1943, Graf had decided to act to save as many of the national team's players as he could from frontline service, attaching them to his unit – the Luftlandebrigade 26 (en: 26th Airborne Brigade) – as "technical experts". Among those who played for the Jäger was Fritz Walter who would go on to fame with 1. FC Kaiserslautern and earn 61 caps with Germany. He wrote the book 11 Rote Jäger about his experiences. German military clubs were disbanded in September 1944 as Allied armies began their advance into the country. Still, the Rote Jäger managed to play two more games in Cracow in November 1944, the last of these in front of 20,000 German soldiers. Postwar re-establishment[edit] A successor side was established 21 May 1965 by the Luftlandebrigade 26 of the German Army with the support of former players of the original side. The new Rote Jäger, based in Zweibrücken, debuted in a friendly match versus then Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern (0:2). The club played as a demonstration side and in armed forces competition, drawing its players from recruits doing military service. Recognizable names who donned the club's jersey during their service terms before going on to professional careers and national team appearances include Felix Magath, Wolfgang Seel, Heinz Simmet, and Andreas Brehme. The club was disbanded in October 1991.

Contents 1 Biography 2 Family 3 His full posthumous name 4 Ancestry 5 In popular culture 6 See also 7 References Biography[edit] Sunjo ascended to the throne at age 10 in 1800 upon the death of his father, King Jeongjo. In 1802, King Sunjo married Lady Kim of Andong, known posthumously as Queen Sunwon, daughter of Kim Jo-sun who was a leader of Andong Kim clan. Since he ascended the throne at a young age, Queen Dowager Jeongsun, the second queen of King Yeongjo, ruled as queen regent, which allowed her to wield power over state affairs. Despite King Sunjo's efforts to reform politics, the fundamental principles of government deteriorated. The state examination became disordered and corruption in the government personnel administration prevailed. This resulted in disorder in society and various riots broke out among the people, including the revolt by Hong Gyeong-nae in 1811-1812. The Ogajaktongbeop (五家作統法), a census registration system to group five houses as one unit, was carried out in this period, and oppression against Roman Catholicism began in earnest.[1] King Sunjo died after reigning for 35 years in 1834 at the age of 44. He was first buried next to Jangneung, Paju, the tomb of King Injo and Queen Inyeo but later moved to Illeung, Seoul as the Feng Shui at the old site was deemed to be unfavourable.[2] Family[edit] Father: King Jeongjo of Joseon (28 October 1752 – 18 August 1800) (조선 정조) Grandfather : King Jangjo of Joseon (13 February 1735 – 12 July 1762) (조선 장조) Grandmother : Queen Heongyeong of the Pungsan Hong clan (6 August 1735 – 13 January 1816) (헌경왕후 홍씨) Mother: Royal Noble Consort Su of the Bannam Park clan (8 May 1770 – 26 December 1822) (수빈 박씨)[3] Grandfather : Park Jun-Won (1739 – 1807) (박준원), third cousin of Bak Jiwon, a famous philosopher and politician.

Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 3 Charity work 4 References Early life[edit] Francis was born in Marion, Ohio. He moved to Norfolk, England with his mother and sister when he was three years old. Career[edit] Francis began his acting career with London's National Youth Theatre. Outside of Britain, he pursued a variety of stage and film projects that took him back to the United States and eventually to Japan. A string of appearances on Japanese television[1] led Francis to divide his time between Tokyo and his home in London. Notable work include the documentary film Kicking It.[2] Narrated by Colin Farrell, the documentary premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2008. The documentary allowed Francis to champion several social causes with which he is actively involved. The New York Times said that the film is "so earnest it hurts" in its treatment of homelessness and poverty.[3] Francis ventured outside acting when he wrote and produced Bollocks,[4] which premiered in Greece at the Peloponnesian International Film Festival in 2012.[5] Charity work[edit] Outside of film and television, Francis is active with humanitarian causes. After the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, he led efforts to organise fundraising activities in Oxford.[6] References[edit] ^ "Brandon Francis Filmography". imdb.com.

The station is owned by Riverfront Broadcasting, LLC. It airs a News/Talk radio format.[2] The station was assigned these call letters by the Federal Communications Commission.[3] Weekday programming includes local morning and drive time news programs as well as nationally syndicated programming from Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Dave Ramsey, Jim Bohannon, and Red Eye Radio. Weekend programming includes syndicated programming from Kim Komando and a variety of lifestyle programming. During the NFL football season, select Sunday games are aired from Westwood One Radio Networks as well as every Monday and Thursday night game. The station also airs all Denver Broncos game through the Denver Broncos Radio Network. All playoff and Super Bowl games are carried as well. History[edit] The station first hit the airwaves on November 26, 1936 as KOBH (Kall Of the Black Hills), a Thanksgiving Day present to western South Dakota. It was owned by Black Hills Broadcasting, and operated from studios in the Hotel Alex Johnson in downtown Rapid City. Originally broadcasting with a very limited licensed power of 150 watts, in 1944 KOBH sought approval from the Federal Communications Commission to move up to 5000 watts, which would dramatically improve its ability to reach this mountainous area. Asked to help, Congressman Francis H. Case sought military support. He discovered that U.S. Army Air Corps airplanes based at the recently established Rapid City Army Air Base (later renamed Ellsworth Air Force Base) used KOBH as a navigation beacon while training for European strategic bombing during World War II. With Pentagon backing, Case convinced the FCC to grant the power increase. On New Year's Day 1945, the station signed on from its new, more powerful tower under new call letters, KOTA.[4] In the same year, it secured an affiliation with CBS Radio that continues to this day. In 1954, Rapid City businesswoman Helen Duhamel, a minority owner since 1943, bought full control of the station, changing its corporate name to Duhamel Broadcasting Enterprises. Since the 1990s, it has been a news and talk station. In May 2017, the station signed on a new FM signal in Rapid City. The FM translator has an assigned frequency of 100.7 FM and an effective radiated power of 250-watts. The licensed translator uses the FCC assigned call sign K264CP. This was done as part of the FCC’s AM Revitalization program.[5] Notable alumni of the station include B-movie producer Arch Hall Sr. On January 1, 2019, the Duhamel family sold KOTA to Riverfront Broadcasting for $3.6 million.[6] The sale was completed on May 1.[7] References[edit] ^ https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?list=0&facid=17678 ^ "Winter 2008 Station Information Profile".

Tupelo Nyssa sylvatica foliage and flowers Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Plantae Clade: Tracheophytes Clade: Angiosperms Clade: Eudicots Clade: Asterids Order: Cornales Family: Nyssaceae Genus: NyssaGronov. ex L.[1] Synonyms[2] Tupelo Adans. Agathisanthes Blume Ceratostachys Blume Streblina Raf. Daphniphyllopsis Kurz Tupelo /ˈtuːpɪloʊ/, genus Nyssa /ˈnɪsə/,[3] is a small genus of deciduous trees with alternate, simple leaves.[1][4] It is sometimes included in the subfamily Nyssoideae of the dogwood family, Cornaceae, but is placed by other authorities in the family Nyssaceae.[5] In the APG IV system, it is placed in Nyssaceae.[6] Most Nyssa species are highly tolerant of wet soils and flooding, and some need such environments as habitat.[7] Some of the species are native to eastern North America, from southeastern Canada through the Eastern United States to Mexico and Central America.[1] Other species are found in eastern and southeastern Asia, from China south through Indochina to Java and southwest to the Himalayas.[2][4] Contents 1 Names 2 Species 3 Uses 3.1 Honey 4 Fossil record 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Names[edit] The genus name Nyssa refers to a Greek water nymph.[8] The name tupelo, the common name used for Nyssa, is of Native American origin, coming from the Creek words ito 'tree' and opilwa 'swamp'; it was in use by the mid-18th century.[9] The city of Tupelo, Mississippi, is named for this tree. Species[edit] Between seven and ten living species of Nyssa are recognized:[2][1] Nyssa aquatica L. – Water tupelo (southeastern United States) Nyssa biflora Walter[1][5] (or Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora[2]) Nyssa javanica (Blume) Wangerin - Eastern Himalayas, Indochina, Borneo, Java, Sumatra Nyssa ogeche W.Bartram ex Marshall – Ogeechee tupelo (southeastern United States) Nyssa sinensis Oliv. – Chinese tupelo (southern China, Vietnam, Myanmar) †Nyssa spatulata (Scott) Manchester[10] (Extinct, Middle Eocene; Clarno Formation, Oregon) Nyssa sylvatica Marshall – Black tupelo or black-gum (eastern + central United States; eastern + southern Mexico; Ontario) Nyssa talamancana Hammel & N.Zamora - (Panama, Costa Rica) Nyssa ursina Nyssa yunnanensis W.C.Yin – Yunnan tupelo (Yunnan) Uses[edit] Tupelo wood is used extensively by artistic woodcarvers, especially for carving ducks and other wildfowl.[11] It power carves excellently and holds good detail in the end grain. In commerce, it is used for shipping containers and interior parts of furniture, and is used extensively in the veneer and panel industry for crossbanding, plywood cores, and backs.[12][13] The wood can be readily pulped and is used for high-grade book and magazine papers.[14] In the past, the hollow trunks were used as "bee gums" to hold beehives.[15] Tupelos are popular ornamental trees for their mature form, shade, and spectacular Autumn leaf colors. Tupelos are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Endoclita damor.[citation needed] The Ogeechee Tupelo, sometimes referred to as the Ocheechee Lime, which is native to Georgia and north Florida produces an edible fruit in the form of a sour, oblong drupe.[16] Honey[edit] Tupelos of the species Nyssa ogeche are valued as honey plants in the southeastern United States, particularly in the Gulf Coast region.[17] They produce a very light, mild-tasting honey. In Florida, beekeepers keep beehives along the river swamps on platforms or floats during tupelo bloom to produce certified tupelo honey, which commands a high price on the market because of its flavor.[17] Monofloral honey made from the nectar of Nyssa ogeche has such a high ratio of fructose to glucose that it does not crystallize.[18] The Apalachicola River in the Florida Panhandle is the center for tupelo honey. The honey is produced wherever tupelo trees (three species) bloom in southeastern USA, but the purest and most expensive version (which is certified by pollen analysis) is produced in this valley. In a good harvest year, the tupelo honey crop produced by a group of specialized Florida beekeepers has a value approaching $1,000,000.[19] Fossil record[edit] Fruits conforming morphologically and anatomically to Nyssa have been identified from the Campanian of Alberta, Canada. The fruits conform to a kind that is common in the Paleogene, formerly called Palaeonyssa.[20] See also[edit] Ulee's Gold, a film about a tupelo honey farmer References[edit] ^ a b c d e "Nyssa".

Mayakin was appointed to this position in August 2016, following the retirement of Lieutenant General Valery Khalilov, who would also be killed in the Black Sea in December of that year. His first major event since becoming director of music was conducting the massed bands during the Moscow Victory Day Parade on May 9, 2017.[3] He was born in Moscow in 1969. In his early childhood, he lived near a music school, where he would later be sent at 5 years old to participate in a violin class. In the early 80s, his mother brought home a newspaper with an article about the Moscow Military Music College, which he wanted to be enrolled in. His father however, who was an engineer in the Soviet Army, was hesitant to allow Mayakin to join, as he did not think he wanted to become a military musician. After graduating from the school in 1987, he enrolled in the military department of the Moscow State Conservatory and later the Military University of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, graduating with honors from both institutions. After the attaining the rank Lieutenant, he was sent to Khabarovsk with his wife and two year old daughter, where he worked under the Alexander Pakhomov, who was the first director of bands in the Khabarovsk Garrison.[4] References[edit] ^ https://spasstower.ru/news/muzykalnomu-rukovoditelyu-festivalya-timofeyu-mayakinu-prisvoeno-zvanie-general-mayor/ ^ https://spasstower.ru/news/s-yubileem-glavnyy-voennyy-dirizhyer/ ^ "The music was provided for by the combined military band of the Moscow Garrison headed by Distinguished Artist of Russia Colonel Timofei Mayakin". en.special.kremlin.ru.

Dartmouth and the neighbouring metropolitan area of Halifax form the urban core of the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Both cities, along with the town of Bedford and the Municipality of the County of Halifax were dissolved on April 1, 1996 when they were amalgamated into HRM.

The claims the Mi'kmaq had to the land were virtually ignored. The Mi'kmaq occupied the region for millennia. The Mi'kmaq called the area Ponamogoatitjg[1] (Boonamoogwaddy), which has been varyingly translated as "Tomcod Ground" or "Salmon Place" in reference to the fish which were presumably caught in this part of Halifax Harbour. There is evidence that bands would spend the summer on the shores of the Bedford Basin, moving to points inland before the harsh Atlantic winter set in. From Dartmouth Cove, the Mi'kmaq would have followed an important canoe route inland via the Dartmouth lakes to the Sipekne'katik (Shubenacadie) waterway. The Mi'kmaq resisted the settlement of Dartmouth by the British. One of Halifax's last surviving Mi'kmaq communities was located at Turtle Grove near present-day Tuft's Cove but was devastated in the December 6, 1917 Halifax Explosion. Today the Millbrook First Nation has a small satellite reserve in Cole Harbour on the eastern edge of Dartmouth. Eighteenth Century[edit] Father Le Loutre’s War[edit] vteFather Le Loutre’s War Dartmouth (1749) Grand Pré St. Croix Chignecto (1750) 1st Northeast Coast Dartmouth (1751) Country Harbour Jeddore 2nd Northeast Coast Fort Beauséjour Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq. Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749.[2][3] By unilaterally establishing Halifax the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi'kmaq (1726), which were signed after Father Rale's War.[4] The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754). During Father Le Loutre’s War, there were 8 raids on Dartmouth.[5] In August 1750, the sailing ship Alderney arrived with 353 immigrants.[6] Municipal officials at Halifax decided that these new arrivals should be settled on the eastern side of Halifax Harbour. The community was later given the English name of Dartmouth in honour of William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth who was a former Secretary of State. Raid on Dartmouth (1749)[edit] The Mi'kmaq saw the founding of Halifax without negotiation as a violation of earlier agreements with the British. On 24 September 1749 the Mi'kmaq formally declared their hostility to the British plans for settlement without more formal negotiations.[7] On September 30, 1749, about forty Mi'kmaq attacked six men who were in Dartmouth cutting trees at the saw mill which was under the command of Major Gilman. Four of them were killed, two of whom were scalped, the heads of two were cut off, one was taken prisoner and one escaped giving the alarm.[8][9] A detachment of rangers was sent after the raiding party and cut off the heads of two Mi'kmaq and scalped one.[9] This raid was the first of eight against Dartmouth. The result of the raid, on October 2, 1749, Cornwallis offered a bounty on the head of every Mi'kmaq. He set the amount at the same rate that the Mi'kmaq received from the French for British scalps. As well, to carry out this task, two companies of rangers raised, one led by Captain Francis Bartelo and the other by Captain William Clapham. These two companies served alongside that of John Gorham's company. The three companies scoured the land around Halifax looking for Mi'kmaq.[10] Raid on Dartmouth (1750)[edit] In July 1750, the Mi'kmaq killed and scalped 7 men who were at work in Dartmouth.[11] In August 1750, 353 people arrived on the Alderney and began the town of Dartmouth. The town was laid out in the autumn of that year.[12] The following month, on September 30, 1750, Dartmouth was attacked again by the Mi'kmaq and five more residents were killed.[13] In October 1750 a group of about eight men went out "to take their diversion; and as they were fowling, they were attacked by the Indians, who took the whole prisoners; scalped ... [one] with a large knife, which they wear for that purpose, and threw him into the sea ..."[14] Raid on Dartmouth (1751 March)[edit] John George Pyke, Only image of survivor of the Raid on Dartmouth (1751); only known image of passenger on the Alderney The next year, on March 26, 1751, the Mi'kmaq attacked again, killing fifteen settlers and wounding seven, three of which would later die of their wounds. They took six captives, and the regulars who pursued the Mi'kmaq fell into an ambush in which they lost a sergeant killed.[15] Two days later, on March 28, 1751, Mi'kmaq abducted another three settlers.[15] Dartmouth Massacre (1751 May)[edit] Main article: Raid on Dartmouth Three months later, on May 13, 1751, Broussard led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the "Dartmouth Massacre".[16] Broussard and the others killed twenty settlers - mutilating men, women, children and babies - and took more prisoner.[17] A sergeant was also killed and his body mutilated. They destroyed the buildings. The British returned to Halifax with the scalp of one Mi'kmaq warrior, however, they reported that they killed six Mi'kmaq warriors.[18] French and Indian War[edit] Eastern Battery Plaque, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia By June 1757, the settlers had to be withdrawn completely from the settlement of Lawrencetown (established 1754) because the number of Indian raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses.[19] In nearby Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, in the spring of 1759, there was another Mi'kmaq attack on Eastern Battery, in which five soldiers were killed.[20] The Quakers[edit] Dartmouth continued to develop slowly. In 1785, at the end of the American Revolution, a group of Quakers from Nantucket arrived in Dartmouth to set up a whaling trade. They built homes, a Quaker meeting house, a wharf for their vessels and a factory to produce spermaceti candles and other products made from whale oil and carcasses. It was a profitable venture and the Quakers employed many local residents, but within ten years, around 1795, the whalers moved their operation to Wales.[citation needed] Only one Quaker residence remains preserved in Dartmouth (others have been modernized) and is believed to be the oldest structure in Dartmouth.[21][22] Loyalists[edit] Other families soon arrived in Dartmouth, among them was the Hartshorne family. They were Loyalists who arrived in 1785, and received a grant that included land bordering present-day Portland, King and Wentworth Streets. Woodlawn was once part of the land purchased by a Loyalist, named Ebenezer Allen who became a prominent Dartmouth businessman. In 1786, he donated land near his estate to be used as a cemetery. Many early settlers are interred in the Woodlawn cemetery including the remains of the "Babes in the Woods," two sisters who wandered into the forest and perished.{25} Nineteenth Century[edit] By the early 19th century, Dartmouth consisted of about twenty-five families working as a sawmill and agricultural outpost of Halifax. However, in the mid 19th century, Dartmouth grew quickly, first with the construction of the Shubenacadie Canal in the 1820s and more importantly with the rise of successful industrial firms such as the Dartmouth Marine Slips founded in 1850. Within twenty years, there were sixty houses, a church, gristmill, shipyards, saw mill, two inns and a bakery located near the harbour. In 1860, Starr Manufacturing Company began operations near the Shubenacadie Canal. The factory employed over 150 workers and manufactured one of the world's first mass-produced ice skates, as well as cut nails, vault doors, iron bridge work and other heavy iron products. The Mott's candy and soap factory, employing 100, opened at Hazelhurst (near present-day Hazelhurst and Newcastle Streets). The Stairs Ropeworks, later Consumer Cordage, was a rope factory on Wyse Road offered work to over 300 and created its own residential neighborhood. The Symonds Foundry employed a further 50 to 100 people. As the population grew, more houses were erected and new businesses established. Subdivisions such as Woodlawn, Woodside and Westphal developed on the outskirts of the town. The Tallahassee Escape[edit] During the American Civil War, on August 18, 1864, the Confederate ship CSS Tallahassee under the command of John Taylor Wood sailed into Halifax harbour for supplies, coal and to make repairs to her mainmast. Wood began loading coal at Woodside, on the Dartmouth shore. Two union ships were closing in on the Tallahassee, the Nansemont and the Huron. While Wood was offered an escort out of the harbour he instead slipped out of the harbour under the cover of night by going through the seldom used Eastern Passage between McNab’s Island and the Dartmouth Shore. The channel was narrow and crooked with a shallow tide so Wood hired the local pilot Jock Flemming. The Tallahassee left the Woodside wharf at 9:00 p.m. on the 19th. All the lights were out, but the residents on the Eastern Passage mainland could see the dark hull moving through the water, successfully evading capture.[23] Incorporation as a Town[edit] In 1873 Dartmouth was incorporated as a town and a Town Hall was established in 1877. In 1883 "The Dartmouth Times" began publishing. In 1885 a railway station was built, and the first passenger service starts in 1886 with branch lines running to Windsor Junction by 1896 and the Eastern Shore by 1904. Two attempts were made to bridge The Narrows of Halifax Harbour with a railway line during the 1880s but were washed away by powerful storms.[citation needed] These attempts were abandoned after the line to Windsor Junction was completed. The line running through Dartmouth was envisioned to continue along the Eastern Shore to Canso or Guysborough, however developers built it inland along the Musquodoboit River at Musquodoboit Harbour and it ended in the Musquodoboit Valley farming settlement of Upper Musquodoboit, ending Dartmouth's vision of becoming a railway hub. Twentieth century[edit] Blast cloud from the Bedford Magazine Explosion Halifax Explosion[edit] Main article: Halifax Explosion The Dartmouth side of the harbour was not as densely populated as Halifax and was separated from the blast by the width of the harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Estimates are that almost 100 people died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company.[24] Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital on the Dartmouth side of the harbour and many of the victims were treated there. Bedford Magazine Explosion[edit] Main article: Bedford Magazine Explosion During World War II Dartmouth as with Halifax was busy supporting Canada's war effort in Europe. On July 18, 1945, at the end of the Second World War, a fire broke out at the magazine jetty on the Bedford Basin, north of Dartmouth. The fire began on a sunken barge and quickly spread to the dock. A violent series of large explosions ensued as stored ammunition exploded. The barge responsible for starting the explosion presently lies on the seabed near the eastern shoreline adjacent to the Magazine Dock.[1] [2] Postwar Boom[edit] Dartmouth saw rapid growth after 1954 when the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge opened, finally providing a direct roadlink to Halifax. The completion of the Macdonald Bridge allowed rapid suburban residential development and prompted the construction of shopping centres such as the original Dartmouth Shopping Centre at the foot of the bridge and Mic Mac Mall. Amalgamation to City Of Dartmouth[edit] In 1961 the communities of Woodlawn, Woodside and Westphal along with the area of the town of Dartmouth joined together to become the "City Of Dartmouth" the city was the third largest city in Nova Scotia, after Halifax and Sydney. Amalgamation to Halifax Regional Municipality[edit] During the 1990s, Dartmouth like many other Canadian cities, amalgamated with its suburbs under a single municipal government. The provincial government had sought to reduce the number of municipal governments throughout the province as a cost-saving measure and created a task force in 1992 to pursue this rationalization. In 1995, an Act to Incorporate the Halifax Regional Municipality received Royal Assent in the provincial legislature and the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) was created on April 1, 1996. HRM is an amalgamation of all municipal governments in Halifax County, these being the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, town of Bedford, and Municipality of the County of Halifax). Dartmouth still retained its place name and identity The term "Dartmouthians", still refers to the residents living in the area of Dartmouth, the regional municipality is often referred by its full name or the initials "HRM" especially in the media refers to the municipal government or the whole area of the Halifax Regional Municipality .

The dam creates Lake Burley Griffin, that was established for recreational and ornamental purposes. Named in honour of surveyor, Charles Scrivener, the dam was officially inaugurated on 20 September 1964 (1964-09-20) and the official filling of the lake commemorated on 17 October 1964 (1964-10-17), by the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. The dam wall is located on Lady Denman Drive and is adjacent to the National Zoo & Aquarium and a viewing area for the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. Contents 1 Technical details 1.1 Dam maintenance 1.2 Flood mitigation 2 History 2.1 Lake filling 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Technical details[edit] Scrivener Dam with three open fish belly floodgates, 2010 Scrivener Dam, designed in Germany,[1] holds back the waters of the Molonglo River within Lake Burley Griffin. About 55,000 cubic metres (1,900,000 cu ft) of concrete was used in the construction of the dam wall. The dam is 33 metres (108 ft) high and 319 metres (1,047 ft) long with a maximum wall thickness of 19.7 metres (65 ft). The dam is designed to handle a once in 5,000 year flood event.[2] It utilised state-of-the-art post-tensioning techniques to cope with any problems or movements in the riverbed.[3] The dam has five bay spillways controlled by 30.5 metres (100 ft) wide,[2] hydraulically operated fish-belly flap gates.[3] Hinge anchors support the flap gates; with six hinges per gate, and four anchors per hinge.[4] The fish-belly gates allow for a precise control of water level, reducing the dead area on the banks between high and low water levels. As at November 2010, the five gates have only been opened simultaneously once in the dam's history, during heavy flooding in 1976.[2] The dam wall provides a crossing for the lake and consists of a roadway, called Lady Denman Drive, and a bicycle path.[5] The roadway was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below, unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates were lifted from above.[6] Dam maintenance[edit] Floating maintenance barrier for Scrivener Dam stored at Yarramundi Reach Lake Burley Griffin Canberra The National Capital Authority, a statutory authority of the Australian Government, is responsible for the administration and oversight of Scrivener Dam, as the dam lies within the Designated Area, under the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act, 1988 (Cth). The Authority manages external contractors to deliver services that are competitively tendered.[7][8] A routine annual audit of the dam wall undertaken during 2011 revealed that the anchor bolts, which are part of the flap gate hinge mechanism, showed signs of corrosion. These bolts, of which there are 120 in total, are each 50 millimetres (2.0 in) in diameter and 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) long.[4] It was anticipated that work would be completed by the end of 2013, and cost A$20m.[9][10] Flood mitigation[edit] Scrivener Dam is operated in an environment that minimises flooding of the environs of Lake Burley Griffin.[8] Flows of 2,000 m3/s (71,000 cu ft/s) and above at the dam spillway are achieved with all five floodgates open and are able to maintain the normal level of the Lake at 555.93 metres (1,823.9 ft), measured at the East Basin. With three floodgates open, outflows of 55 m3/s (1,900 cu ft/s) can be achieved through either automatic or manual operation of the dam. A minimum base flow of 0.03 m3/s (1.1 cu ft/s) is required in the Molonglo River, downstream of Scrivener Dam at the gauging station below Coppins Crossing.[8] History[edit] See also: History of Lake Burley Griffin Lights of the dam at night Lake filling[edit] A prolonged drought coincided with and eased work on the lake's construction. The valves on the Scrivener Dam were closed on 20 September 1963 by Interior Minister Gordon Freeth; Prime Minister Menzies was absent due to ill health.[6] Several months on, with no rain in sight, mosquito-infested pools of water were the only visible sign of the lake filling.[6] With the eventual breaking of the drought and several days of heavy rain, the lake filled,[2] and reached the planned level on 29 April 1964.[11] On 17 October 1964, Menzies commemorated the filling of the lake and the completion of stage one with an opening ceremony amid the backdrop of sailing craft.[11][12] This was accompanied by fireworks display, and Griffin's lake had finally come to fruition after five decades, at the cost of A$5,039,050.[11] The dam, together with Lake Burley Griffin and adjacent lands, is listed on the Register of the National Estate, a listing of places of significant natural and cultural heritage. Since 2012, the register has frozen.[13][14] See also[edit] Australia portal History of Canberra History of Lake Burley Griffin References[edit] ^ Sparke, Eric (1988). Canberra 1954-1980.

PythagorasNationalityRomanOccupationFreedmenKnown forMarriage to NeroTitleWine steward Pythagoras, a freedman of the Roman emperor Nero, was married in a public ceremony in which the emperor took the role of bride.[1][2][3][4] Contents 1 Life 2 Marriage to Nero 3 Doryphorus 4 Bibliography 5 See also 6 References Life[edit] Little is known about Pythagoras' background except that he was a freedman who accompanied Nero and was called "one of that filthy herd" (uni ex illo contaminatorum grege). Marriage to Nero[edit] In the year 64, during the Saturnalia, Tigellinus offered a series of banquets to Nero, after a few days of which Nero performed a marriage to Pythagoras:[5] ... he stooped to marry himself to one of that filthy herd, by name Pythagoras, with all the forms of regular wedlock. The bridal veil was put over the emperor; people saw the witnesses of the ceremony, the wedding dower, the couch and the nuptial torches; everything in a word was plainly visible, which, even when a woman weds darkness hides. Doryphorus[edit] Suetonius tells the story of Nero's being the bride to a freedman named "Doryphorus". Both Tacitus and Dio Cassius mention only "Pythagoras". According to Champlin, it is improbable that a second such scandalous wedding occurred without being noted, and the simplest solution is that Suetonius mistook the name.[6] Doryphorus, one of the wealthiest and most powerful of Nero's freedmen, died in the year 62 before the banquets of Tigellinus,[6] where Nero, covered with skins of wild animals, was let loose from a cage and attacked the private parts of men and women bound to stakes, after which he was dispatched by his freedman "Doryphorus".[7] As "doryphoros" means "spear bearer"[8] (Δορυφόρος) like the statue, it may be that the latinized word had just capitalized the Greek word.[9] Bibliography[edit] Suetonius.
