When they arrive, the village is completely deserted with no locals. The Vicar is the only villager left. He welcomes the trio to stay and explains why the others have left the village. The Goodies are disgusted when they discover that the Army is building a military establishment on what was supposed to be a children's playground. Disguised as members of the military, they provide the plans to the soldiers who are to build the equipment. The Goodies "assist" the Army and their plans lead to the Army 'equipment' looking more like a children's playground than the sleek military equipment the Army is expecting. Then the Army gets another shock — the people, who the Goodies had arranged to turn up to test the equipment, are not exactly what the Army had been expecting to see.

Biography[edit] He was born at Al-Qafla, Hashid. He was the third oldest of king Yahya's fourteen sons. During his father's reign, he was Governor of Ibb Province (1938–1948). After his father's assassination, he supported his older brother Ahmad in becoming King of Yemen. Following a coup attempt by their younger brother Abdullah, he was dismissed as prime minister after being wrongfully suspected of supporting the coup attempt. He was appointed head of North Yemen's delegation to the UN. After the republican coup, he proclaimed himself King and travelled to Saudi Arabia, where he learned that his nephew, King Muhammad, was still alive. He subsequently withdrew his claim to the throne. He was appointed prime minister of the government-in-exile, and served two terms (1962–1967, 1969–1970). He died in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on his 95th birthday. His title was Saif Al-Islam.

She and her family arrived to Mexico in 1938 from Europe and she studied art at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda", where she met and became friends with Frida Kahlo. She became the only female member of “Los Fridos” a group of students under Kahlo’s tutelage. She also worked as an assistant and apprentice to Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros, painting a number of murals of her own during her career. The most significant of these is "Ronda en el tiempo" at the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. She also created canvases and other works, with children often featured in her work, and was one of the first of her generation to work with ecological themes in a series of works begun in 1979. Contents 1 Life 2 Career 3 Artistry 4 References Life[edit] Play media Daughter Paloma Woolrich speaking about the artist at Semana i at the Tec de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Monterrey Fanny Rabel was born Fanny Rabinovich on August 27, 1922 in Poland to a Polish-Jewish couple from a family of traveling actors.[1][2] When she was a child, she could not have dolls, according to her daughter Paloma, so she drew the ones she saw in store windows.[3] Her family was cultured with her sister Malka becoming a theatre critic.[4] The family moved to Paris in 1929, where she first attended school. They then moved to Mexico in 1938. She entered the Escuela Nocturna para Trabajadores, where she took classes in drawing and engraving.[1] Her anti-Nazi and anti-Fascism politics resulted in her participation in a mural called "Retrato de la Burguesía" in 1940 for the Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas building on Alfonso Caso Street in Mexico City. Rabel met a group of exiled Spaniards in Mexico along with Antonio Pujol, who invited her to take part in a mural project headed by him, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Joseph Renau, Luis Arenal, Antonio Rodríguez Luna and Miguel Prieto. This work depicted, among other things, children killed by Nazi bombing in Spain.[4] She entered the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda" shortly after it was established in 1942, taking classes with José Chávez Morado, Feliciano Peña and Frida Kahlo, with whom she became close friends. (universal) .[1] She also became one of Frida Kahlo’s students at the Casa Azul, a group of four called “Los Fridos” (a play on Frida’s name). She was the only female in this group, learning alongside Guillermo Monroy, Arturo García Bustos and Arturo Estrada.[2][5] Other teachers included Francisco Zúñiga, Alfredo Zalce, Raúl Anguiano, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Carlos Orozco Romero and Diego Rivera.[2] She changed her last name from Rabinovich to Rabel during her career.[6] Rabel married urologist Jaime Woolrich and had two children Abel and Paloma Woolrich, both of whom became actors.[4][7] She lived for decades in an apartment on Martinez de Castro Street in the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood in Mexico City. Near the end of her life she lost most of her memory, with Alzheimers suspected.[7][8] She was almost evicted from her apartment at this time as it was deemed unsafe, but she continued living there until she died on November 25, 2008.[3][8] Rabel was buried at the Panteón Israelita. She was survived by her daughter Paloma and her grandchildren.[6] Career[edit] Rabel had her first exhibition of her work in 1945 with twenty four oils, thirteen drawings and eight engravings at the Liga Popular Israelita with Frida Kahlo writing the presentation.[1][6] In 1955, she had an individual exhibition at the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana .[1] She had a large exhibition at the museum of the Palacio de Bellas Artes to commemorate a half century of her work.[2] Her last exhibition was in 2007 at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana .[6] Her work can be found in collections in over fifteen countries including those of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the Royal Academy of Denmark, the National Library in Paris, the Casa de las Américas in Havana, the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City.[2][8] She is considered to be the first female muralist in Mexico.[5] She was an assistant to Diego Rivera while he worked on the frescos for the National Palace and an apprentice to David Alfaro Siqueiros.[6] Her most important mural is Ronda en el tiempo located in the Museo Nacional de Antropología, which was created from 1964 to 1965.[2][6] She also created murals at the Unidad de Lavaderos Público de Tepalcatitlán (1945), Sobrevivencia, Alfabetización in Coyoacán in 1952 Sobrevivencia de un pueblo at the Centro Deportivo Israelita (1957) Hacia la salud for the Hospital Infantil de México (1982), La familia mexicana at the Registro Público de la Propiedad (1984) (which Rabel preferred to title Abolición de la propiedad privada) and at the Imprenta Artgraf. In collaboration with other artists, she participated in the creation of the murals at the La Rosita pulque bar (disappeared) and at the Casa de la Madre Soltera.[2][8] She was a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana and the Taller de Gráfica Popular, joining both in 1950.[1][6] A group of her friends nominated her for the Premio Nacional de Arte but it was denied.[4] However, her work has been honored with a number of retrospective exhibits before and after her death. In 2007, there was a retrospective of her work at the Festival de México in the historic center of Mexico City at the House of the First Print Shop in the Americas with the title of La Fanny de los Fridos.[1][2] Her work was featured at an exhibition called Fanny Rabel y Mujeres del Salón de la Plástica Mexicana held at the José Vasconcelos Library .[9] The Salón de la Plástica Mexicana had a retrospective of her work after he death called Retrospectiva in Memoriam, Fanny Rabel (1922-2008) held at the Museum of the Universidad Popular Autónoma del Estado de Puebla .[3] Artistry[edit] Rabel is considered to be the first modern female muralist in Mexico although she also did significant work in painting, engraving, drawing and ceramic sculpture.[2] Her work has been classified as poetic Surrealism, Neo-expressionism and is also considered part of the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (the dominant art movement of the early to mid 20th century in Mexico) as one of the youngest muralists to be associated with it along with Arnold Belkin and José Hernández Delga .[2][3][7] Rabel was more drawn to depicting mankind’s pain rather than happiness, sharing other Mexican muralists' concerns about social injustice.[1][5] However, she stated to Leopoldo Méndez that she could not create combative works, with clenched fists and fierce faces, and she wanted to leave the Taller de Gráfica Popular. Méndez convinced her to stay, saying that more tender images are important to political struggle as well.[9] Children with Mexican faces are common in her work, often with expressions between laughter and tears. They are generally poor children, meant to depict the socioeconomically marginalized populations in the country. However, she did not paint outright tragedy or tears.[1] In many of her works, the different social classes of Mexico are contrasted, often with indigenous peoples.[9] The gentleness of her works, she insisted was “for the revolution.”[4] She also did one portrait of Frida Kahlo, a pencil drawing which was first exhibited near the end of her life.[7] She was economically prosperous, something which bothered her as she worried about exploiting the poor for art.[1] Unlike artists who avoided the news and popular culture as to not poorly influence their art, Rabel attended concerts, listened to the radio and was a fan of film from both Mexico and Hollywood.[4] She was one of the first of her generation to develop themes related to ecology, the changes in Mexico City, against technocracy and emphasis on commerce.[7] She began a series of paintings in 1979 called “Réquiem por una ciudad” depicting what she considered to be the destruction of Mexico City by smog, traffic and garbage. The works include: "Diálogo capitalino," "Muerte citadina," "Los peatones van al cielo," "El profundo drenaje," "La rebelión de los peatones" and "México, D.F."[4] "Réquiem para una ciudad" in 1979 considers three themes: the lack of human communication, the traffic, and pollution of the air and ground.[7] "La rebelión de los peatones" in 1987 expresses a worry about the excess of cars in the city.[9] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j Tibol, Raquel (May 20, 2007).

He is best known for his roles as Barry "Newt" Newton in the soap opera Hollyoaks (2007–2010), Finn Nelson in My Mad Fat Diary (2013–2015), Joe Middleton in The Village (2013), and Johnjo O'Shea in Common (2014). Among his other film roles are Spike Island (2012), Anita B. (2014), and The Pass (2016). Recognised in 2012 by Screen International as one of its "Stars of Tomorrow", he has been lauded as one of the United Kingdom's "most promising young actors".[1][2] Among his award nominations are those for Best Actor at the BBC Audio Drama Awards (2016, for Orpheus and Eurydice) and Best Supporting Actor at the BAFTA Awards (2014, for The Village).[3] Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 2.1 Television 2.2 Film 2.3 Stage 2.4 Radio 3 Charity work 4 Personal life 5 Filmography 5.1 Film 5.2 Television 5.3 Stage 5.4 Music videos 5.5 Radio 5.6 Web series 5.7 Audio books 6 Awards and nominations 7 Notes 8 References 9 External links Early life[edit] Nico Cristian Mirallegro was born on 26 January 1991 in Heywood, Greater Manchester. His Italian father is from Sicily and his Irish mother, Maureen McLaughlin, is from Malin Head.[4] He briefly attended a boarding school outside the UK, at which he was lonely and felt out of place.[5] He also attended Siddal Moor Sports College in Heywood and the Manchester School of Acting.[5][6] His parents are separated and his father lives in Spain, with Mirallegro having moved there as a teenager to live with him for a time.[7] He is conversational in Italian and Spanish.[8] Mirallegro says that he "fell into" acting in his mid-teens after following his sister Claudia to improv classes. At one of his first acting classes, he was "so scared [he] had to get one of the other lads to say [his] lines".[9] Career[edit] Television[edit] Mirallegro's first professional acting role came in 2007, after he was cast as emo teenager Newt in the long-running British soap opera Hollyoaks. Although he voluntarily left Hollyoaks after two years at age 18 to follow other acting projects,[10] he was grateful for the opportunity to appear on the show: "Hollyoaks is where I learnt a lot of the craft, being in front of a camera six days a week. That's certainly an experience you don't get in drama school."[11] When filming for Hollyoaks, Mirallegro was also playing Cam Spencer in LOL, a web series which explored sex, drugs, and relationships.[12] In 2010, Mirallegro appeared in an episode of the BBC drama series Moving On as a gay youngster who suffers bullying in school because of his sexuality.[13] Beginning 2010, he appeared as an Italian foreign exchange student in nine episodes of the regular BBC series Doctors.[14] In December 2010, Mirallegro was in series one of the BBC One 1930s-period remake of Upstairs Downstairs. He portrayed a young footman called Johnny Proude, who took up a position in service to escape the poverty of the northern mining town where he was born. The BBC re-commissioned the production for a second series,[15] in which he appeared again as Johnny. In the second series, his character appeared in a boxing tournament, requiring Mirallegro to take boxing lessons for the role.[11] In 2011, Mirallegro appeared in the BBC's three-part psychological thriller Exile,[16] playing the teenage version of leading character Tom Ronstadt. Later that year, he played Sam, a gay heroin addict in the BBC drama The Body Farm.[17] In 2013, he began playing Finn Nelson, the love interest of the main female character in E4's teen comedy-drama series My Mad Fat Diary.[18] That same year, he also played the role of Joe Middleton in the BBC drama The Village.[19] In 2014, Mirallegro portrayed a teenager prosecuted for murder under the Joint Enterprise law in the controversial BBC One production Common, written by Jimmy McGovern.[20] Called "a bleak, powerful drama thick with political intent", a review started that Mirallegro "continues to prove himself as the best actor ever to graduate from Hollyoaks".[21] The 2015 television film The Ark told the story of Noah, along with elements from Islamic tradition. Mirallegro portrayed Kenan,[a] Noah's youngest (and extrabiblical) son, whose wish to follow a path different from his father and brothers results in his being swept away in the Great Flood.[22] Mirallegro also starred in HBO's Virtuoso, directed and partially written by Alan Ball. Set in the 18th century, Mirallegro played a self-taught violin prodigy who travels to Vienna to learn with other young musicians.[23] In June 2017, Mirallegro acted in the BBC's BAFTA winning real-life drama Murdered for Being Different, about the murder of Sophie Lancaster in 2007.[24] In 2019, it was confirmed he would be cast as an army soldier in the new series of the long-running BBC One drama Our Girl. Film[edit] Mirallegro's first film, the short film Six Minutes of Freedom, was shot in 2009.[25] He starred as a troubled teenager training to be a boxer while his father is in prison. The film was entered into four film festivals, and it won Best New Wave Short Film at the Yellow Fever Independent Film Festival.[26] In the summer of 2010, Mirallegro finished filming for his role in McQueen the Movie. He played Sam, a Jewish boy who is one of the story's two protagonists. The film is set in suburbia in the North of England in the 1990s. Mirallegro portrayed a teenage lead guitarist in a full-length film set in the 1990s about the Manchester-formed rock band The Stone Roses. The film, Spike Island, was released in 2012.[27][28] He called his time making Spike Island "six weeks of pure bliss."[7] Shooting for Socrates is a 2014 football drama telling "the underdog story of a Northern Ireland team who kick off their world cup against football giants Brazil. The game is a baptism of fire for [Mirallegro's] character, David Campbell, who makes his Northern Ireland debut in front of 50,000 people the day before his 21st birthday".[29] The film's cast was recognized as talented, but reviews of the script were less positive.[b] Stage[edit] In January 2014, Mirallegro appeared at London's Royal Court Theatre in the drama The Pass,[31] in which Russell Tovey plays a football player coming to terms with his homosexuality.[32] Mirallegro reprised his comic role as a hotel bellboy in an "irrepressible performance"[33] in a 2016 film adaptation of the work, which premiered at the BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival. Radio[edit] Since 2014, Mirallegro has performed in several BBC Radio 4 dramas, including as the eponymous male character in Orpheus and Eurydice. For this role he was nominated Best Actor at the BBC Audio Drama Awards in 2016. He was later cast as the protagonist in 79 Birthdays (2016) and as the son in Over Here, Over There (2016).[34] The latter is a radio drama inspired by the plight of asylum seekers in the UK.[35] Charity work[edit] Mirallegro plays in celebrity football matches for charities such as Help For Heroes and Once Upon a Smile.[36] Personal life[edit] Mirallegro is a supporter of Manchester United FC.[37] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 2010 Six Minutes of Freedom Chris Short film[38] 2010 McQueen, The Movie Sam 2011 Wheels of Fortune Ben Short film[39] 2012 Spike Island Dodge[40] 2014 Anita B.

Some later Islamic commentators give his name as either Yam or Kan'an. This drama interprets his name as Kenan. ^ "Shooting for Socrates is a "narrative that . . . sells its talented cast short – and that's not merely troublesome. It's fatal. . . . Fine actor though John Hannah is, his Billy Bingham is a blank slate with the wrong accent, and Nico Mirallegro fares little better, despite his best efforts."[30] References[edit] ^ "Heywood actor in line for Bafta".

(March 2015) Nanchong White Tower Park is a comprehensive park, and it is the provincial key cultural relic’s protection units. The White tower was commonly known as "the white tower" in the song dynasty, formerly known as "the boundless pagoda".[1] It was built in the Northern Song dynasty (AD 960), and has lasted more than one thousand years.

Jialing River, one of the most important tributaries of the Yangtze River, flows under the bridge – here the river is very wide, very quiet and very deep.[citation needed] Decoration[edit] The White Tower is 39.56 meters tall, with thirteen layer imitation wood of square tower.

White Tower Park is brick tower with stone as the stylobate, and it carves the pictures of dragons around the patterns. The body of the towers is 13 floors. We can enter it by the arch in the first floor.[citation needed] Architect[edit] The tower was built by Luban, an inventor in ancient China and regarded as the Father by the civil craftsmen. At that time, he had made a bet with his disciple – a white and a black tower were built by each one, the one who completed the tower firstly is the winner. At last, the white tower, built by Luban, was the firstly finished and remains extant.[citation needed] Extension[edit] From 2009, the White Tower has extended the area to twice in the square, and the road infrastructure construction in the park has been basically completed. These buildings are completed at the end of December and it can be open to the public before the Spring Festival.[2] The white tower has been firstly finished in 2011, which covers an area of 210 acres of park. After 2014, The white tower park has completed the second expansion, which increasingly covers an area of 500 acres and it has become the biggest leisure park in Nanchong.[2] References[edit] ^ 互动百科 白塔公园.

She experienced strong popularity in the U.S. after World War II, worked with Renault to develop the company's textile and color division, and redefined furnishing fabrics in her native country of France. Marrot won the Prix Blumenthal[1] in 1928 and in 1952, the French Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor), as Chevalier.[2] Contents 1 Early Life 2 Career 3 Marrot at Renault 4 Licensing and posthumous releases 5 See also 6 References Early Life[edit] Paule Marrot was born Paule Félicie Hélène Marrot in Bordeaux on 17 April 1902,[3] to a bohemian family with a musician father.[4] Marrot attended L’école des Arts Décoratifs in Paris at age 14 and in 1917 apprenticed in engraving and textile printing with Pierre Léon Dusouchet. Marrot became a teacher and was selling some of her original textile designs when she met Raoul Dufy, a Fauvist painter, who in turn introduced her to Paul Poiret, a prominent fashion designer at the time — to whom Marrot subsequently sold a dress design — and ultimately fabric for his work.[4] Career[edit] In 1924 she was admitted to the Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of Decorative Artists), and married her childhood friend, Paul Angelloz, who became her business manager.[4] In 1925, Marrot shows printed fabrics at the Worlds Fair's International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts that showcases to her personality and new style which wins her a gold medal.[3][5] Winning the Prix Blumenthal in 1928 allowed Marrot to open her workshop in Batignolles on at 34 rue Truffaut, where she became widely known for furniture textiles. In 1932 her work was exhibited in the Salon des Artistes Decorateurs show came to the attention of Jean Schlumberger,[4] an Alsacian textile manufacturer with Manufacture Steiner de Ribeauvillé. Schlumberger became her exclusive printer and a devoted friend for 30 years until his death in 1963. Together they produced over 320 fabric designs and numerous table linens.[4] Marrot moved her operation to rue des Arcades in 1936.[3] After the war, she reopened the rue des Arcades store and in 1945 resumed production with Ribeauvillé. Working with Margaret Owen, she established the import of her textiles to the USA[3] — Jacqueline Kennedy subsequently designing a living room around Marrot's Les Tulipes cotton print. From 1953-1965, Marrot consulted with Renault, prioritizing color and fabric coordination for the company and establishing their interior and exterior paint and textile labs.[3] In May 1959, she exhibited her work at Stockholm's Artek gallery, which had distributed her line of 104 printed fabrics and 28 tablecloths since 1935. From 1961 to 1968 Marrot collaborated with Zofia Rostand, whose student she had been in 1960.[3] In 1973, Marrot exhibited 82 fabrics and tablecloths at the Exposition au Musée d’impression sur Etoffe de Mulhouse (Museum of Printed Textiles at Mulhouse), working with Fauve painter Raoul Dufy.[3] Paule Marrot died on 22 December 1987.[3] Marrot at Renault[edit] Marrot worked with Renault to develop its textile and paint division, transforming the color of its products from somber postwar colors to a fresh, vibrant palette In 1950, the president of General Motors had visited automobile manufacturer Renault, noting the cars' drab colors, inside and out.[1] According to Renault's own preliminary research for the upcoming Dauphine, a 1951 survey had shown that women held stronger opinions on a car's colors than the car itself.[1] Coincidentally, Marrot had written a letter to Renault's chairman, Pierre Lefaucheux, giving her opinion that the postwar cars of Paris were a uniformly somber parade — and wondering whether an artist could not help find fresh, vibrant colors.[6] Convinced of her value to the project, Pierre Lefaucheux made her a member of the Dauphine team — "to rid Renault of their stuffy image. After decades of being dipped in various shades of black and grey, car bodies [would be] painted in happy pastels."[7][8] Working with four others, Marrot proposed new body and interior colors after setting up a new test laboratory to measure fabric wear as well as paint wear and uniformity. The new colors contrasted with the colors from the competition, the Peugeot 203 and Simca Aronde, including bright colors with evocative names including Rouge Montijo, Jaune Bahamas, Bleu Hoggar and Blanc Réja.[1] Marrot and her team then developed complementary interior fabrics for the seats and door panels, turning to Paris' large textile houses.[1] Marrot also designed the Dauphine's emblem, with three dolphins over a crown,[7] which would adorn the Dauphine's steering wheel and hood throughout its production.[1] Over 2 million Dauphines were produced in its production run of 10 years,[9] each bearing Marrot's imprint.[10] Licensing and posthumous releases[edit] 1999 saw the creation of Editions Paule Marrot Ltd which became SAS Editions Paule Marrot in 2002, reissuing more than 700 fabrics from Marrot's career along with numerous tablecloths and towel designs, a total of more than 670 designs.[3] In 2005, Carolina Irving wrote a story about Marrot for Better Homes and Gardens and in 1997 the Museum of Printed Textiles at Mulhouse[11] held a retrospective of her work. Marrot designs have since been used extensively under license by companies as diverse as Nike, Anthropologie and the handbag maker, Hayden-Harnett.[3] In 1952, she won the Legion of Honor.[3][12][13] See also[edit] Renault Dauphine Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor) Prix Blumenthal References[edit] ^ a b c d e f "Des femmes et des hommes...

Pierre Lefaucheux, had been put on notice and thus decided to organize a new effort in this area. He was helped in the matter by a letter he had received from Paule Marrot, who was pained at the endless parade of somber cars in Paris, wondering whether an artist could not seek more merry and fresh colors of body. Pierre Lefaucheux, en homme avisé, décida donc d'une nouvelle organisation dans ce domaine. Il fut bien aidé en cela par une lettre, qu'il avait reçue de Paule Marrot, qui s'affligeait de ne voir défiler dans Paris que des voitures uniformément tristes, se demandant si un artiste ne pouvait rechercher des couleurs de carrosserie plus gaies et fraîches. ^ a b "History".

She is the author of Eunice, The Kennedy Who Changed the World, to be published by Simon and Schuster, on April 3, 2018. She is chair of the Journalism Program at Brandeis University and formerly a columnist with the Boston Globe, where she won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1997.[2] Life and career[edit] A graduate of Barnard College (1974) and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism (1976), she was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard for the academic year 1987–88. She began her journalism career at Barnard as a campus correspondent for the Daily News in New York City before graduating to The News-Times of Danbury, CT and United Press International in Boston. Her nickname is "Mac". During nearly 30 years at The Boston Globe, she covered everything from the night police beat to the United States Congress. First hired as a newsroom secretary, she worked her way up through the general assignment staff, the State House Bureau, the special projects team and the Sunday magazine staff to the position of columnist in 1995. In addition to the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary (1997), she has been the recipient of writing and public service awards from the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Sigma Delta Chi, the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation and others for a reporting career that focused on social issues as infant mortality, domestic violence and juvenile crime. In 2007, she was named a winner of the Yankee Quill Award, the highest individual honor given by the Academy of New England Journalists. She is married to sportswriter Peter May,[3] and is the mother of three adult children: Timothy, Patrick and Katherine. A regular on local public affairs programs in Boston, she has also appeared on The Today Show, Larry King Live and Nightline. She appeared on The Daily Show on September 25, 2006. McNamara is the author of two previous books: Breakdown: Sex, Suicide and the Harvard Psychiatrist (which was an Edgar Award finalist in 1994) and The Parting Glass: A Toast to the Traditional Pubs of Ireland (with photographer Eric Roth). She contributed to the Boston Globe's coverage of the clergy sexual abuse scandal by recommending that the Spotlight Team look further into the cases she had reported on previously. In the 2015 film Spotlight, McNamara was played by actress Maureen Keiller. Spotlight won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2016.

It is part of the Great Lakes Basin, which eventually reaches the Atlantic Ocean. It is a sub-region of the greater Northwest Indiana region and the even larger Great Lakes region. This region includes the northern parts of Lake and Porter counties and the western portion of La Porte county in Indiana, as well as the eastern counties of northern Illinois, Will and Cook.[1] Since much of this region is on the south shore of Lake Michigan, it is sometimes referred to as the "South Shore". Because it was initially cut off from the rest of the state due to natural geographic barriers like the Kankakee Marsh to the south, the Calumet Region was the last-settled portion of Indiana.[1] The area is known for its industrial heritage and history as a center for production of steel, minerals and chemicals. The toxic byproducts of these industries present major issues for public safety and natural resource management today.[2] The region was a center for the labor rights movement of the 1930s. The Memorial Day massacre of 1937, where ten steelworkers' rights activists were killed by police officers during a demonstration, occurred on Chicago's southeast side.[3] Today, Calumet is notable as a site of many habitat restoration projects. The area contains many endangered dune, Swale, and moraine based ecosystems.[4] Many Forest Preserve District of Cook County sites, such as Powderhorn Prairie, 95th/Dan Ryan Woods, and Eggers Grove are being restored under the care of volunteer stewards.[5] In addition, nonprofit groups partner with the Forest Preserve District and Chicago Park District to complete larger-scale restoration projects. Major partners include The Field Museum, the Wetlands Initiative, and local branches of The Nature Conservancy, Green Corps and the Student Conservation Association.[6] Many of these sites have become host to locally rare and threatened species like Blanding's turtle, Wilson's phalarope and the least weasel.[7] Contents 1 Cities 2 Townships 3 Origin 4 History 5 See also 6 References Cities[edit] The Calumet Region includes the Indiana cities of Gary, East Chicago, Hammond, Highland, Munster, Hobart, Whiting, Crown Point, and Valparaiso. In Illinois a number of cities and villages lie in the Calumet watershed including: the southernmost part of Chicago, Lansing, Calumet City, South Holland, Riverdale, Burnham, Calumet Park, and Blue Island Townships[edit] The Calumet Region includes land from the following Indiana townships in Porter County: Portage, Union, Westchester, Liberty, Center, Pine, Jackson, Washington. It includes land located within the following townships of Lake County: North, St. John, Calumet, Hobart, and Ross. It also includes Coolspring Township in La Porte County. Origin[edit] The name Calumet is said to come from French interpretations of either the Potawatomi name for the rivers and lake in question (“low body of deep, still water”)[8] or is a corruption of the Old French term Chalemel, which means "reed". The word appears on early maps as Cal-La-Mick, Kil-La-Mick, Calumic, etc.[1] History[edit] Historical population Census Pop. %± 189096,371—1900120,19324.7%1910172,74943.7%1920254,76147.5%1930367,85044.4%1940409,81311.4%1950513,07325.2%1960699,00336.2%1970770,74410.3%1980792,3952.8%1990750,103−5.3%2000786,0774.8%2010819,5374.3%2015 (est.)813,915[9]−0.7%U.S. Decennial Census (Calumet Region in Indiana)[10] The first known print reference to refer to this area as a distinct geographical region is the 1755 map created by John Mitchell. In this map, however, he referred to the geographic region as "Quadoche", a name that the Iroquois had given to the Potawatomi that were known to occupy the region at that point in time.[11] See also[edit] Ceremonial pipe - aka "Calumet" in French, colonial-era terminology Wolf Lake (Indiana–Illinois) References[edit] ^ a b c Moore, Powell A.

During his freshman season, he earned SEC All-Freshman Team honors. His best season came during his senior year in 2005–06, where he and fellow All-American Chris Lofton led the Volunteers to a 22–8 record and a 12–4 record in SEC play. He averaged 15.3 points, 3.9 assists and 3.1 rebounds, and earned second-team All-SEC honors from the Associated Press and the league coaches. He finished his collegiate career as Tennessee's second all-time leader in assists (577), second in steals (198), sixth in three-point field goal percentage (.396), tied for eighth in three-point field goals (401), and 15th in scoring (1,424 points).[1] Professional career[edit] European career (2006–2007)[edit] Despite an excellent college career, Watson went undrafted in 2006 NBA draft. He then played briefly with San Antonio Spurs in 2006 NBA summer league before joining Italian Serie A team Bipop Carire Reggio Emilia. He averaged 8.5 points and 2.3 rebounds in 17 games. He then moved on to join Greek A1 Ethniki team PAOK B.C. where he averaged 7.4 points and 2.2 assists in five games.[1] D-League career (2007–2008)[edit] Watson returned to the states to revive his NBA career, participated in 2007 NBA summer league with the Spurs and later joined the Charlotte Bobcats' training camp. However, he once again failed to make the roster for the season. On November 1, 2007, he joined NBA D-League and was drafted 5th overall by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers.[2] He averaged 26.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.38 steals in 38.1 minutes per game for the Vipers before signed by Golden State Warriors on January 8, 2008. At the time of the call-up, Watson was the third-leading scorer in the D-League. He also became the 100th player to be called up by an NBA team in D-League history.[3] Golden State Warriors (2008–2010)[edit] On January 8, 2008, Golden State Warriors signed Watson to a 10-day contract to be a backup point guard to All-Star Baron Davis.[3] He impressed Warriors coach Don Nelson and subsequently earned a second 10-day contract.[4] After two 10-day contracts, where he appeared in 8 games, averaging 5.4 points and 1.8 assists in 16.6 minutes, Watson was signed for the remainder of the season. On February 17, 2010, Watson scored a career-high 40 points against the Sacramento Kings with 16-of-23 shooting.[5] Chicago Bulls (2010–2012)[edit] Watson in a game with the Bulls in 2011 On July 21, 2010, Watson was acquired in a sign and trade deal by the Chicago Bulls.[6] On November 26, 2010, the Bulls' starting point guard Derrick Rose was out with a stiff neck. Watson started against the Denver Nuggets and scored a season-high 33 points in a loss, while also shooting 50% from the field.[7][8] On December 14, 2011, Watson changed his number from 32 to 7 because of Richard "Rip" Hamilton signing with the Bulls. On April 28, 2012, in the Bulls' first game of that year's playoffs, guard Derrick Rose suffered a torn ACL in his left knee. In his absence, Watson started the rest of the Bulls' playoff games.[9] The Bulls lost in the first round to the Philadelphia 76ers. Watson averaged 7.3 points on 24% shooting in the series. Brooklyn Nets (2012–2013)[edit] On July 23, 2012, Watson signed with the Brooklyn Nets.[10] On February 13, 2013, he scored a season-high 25 points in the 119–108 win over the Denver Nuggets. His 25 points were the most he'd scored since November 2010, and his five three-pointers also set a career high.[11] Watson averaged 6.8 points in 80 regular season games for the Nets as a backup point guard to Deron Williams. In the Nets' seven playoff games, he averaged 8.6 points per game. Indiana Pacers (2013–2015)[edit] On July 10, 2013, Watson signed with the Indiana Pacers.[12] On April 13, 2014, he scored a season-high 20 points in the 102–97 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[13] In his first season with Indiana, Watson averaged 6.6 points in 63 regular season games as a backup point guard to George Hill. In 18 playoff games, Watson averaged 5.8 points per game. Orlando Magic (2015–2017)[edit] On July 9, 2015, Watson signed with the Orlando Magic.[14] On February 19, 2016, he played in his first game for the Magic since November 9, 2015 due to a left calf injury.[15] On July 10, 2017, Watson was waived by the Magic.[16] Turkey (2018–2019)[edit] In February 2018, Watson signed with Uşak Sportif of the Turkish Super League.[17] Personal life[edit] Watson majored in psychology at Tennessee and continued working toward his degree every summer after starting his professional basketball career. He completed his coursework in 2012.[18] He has one brother, Kashif, who played college basketball for the University of Idaho, and one sister, Vonyetta.[19] NBA career statistics[edit] Legend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high Regular season[edit] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2007–08 Golden State 32 0 11.5 .426 .346 .793 1.0 1.1 .5 .0 3.7 2008–09 Golden State 77 18 24.5 .457 .400 .870 2.5 2.7 1.2 .1 9.5 2009–10 Golden State 65 15 27.5 .468 .310 .771 2.6 2.8 1.6 .1 10.3 2010–11 Chicago 82 1 13.3 .371 .393 .740 1.1 2.3 .7 .1 4.9 2011–12 Chicago 49 25 23.7 .368 .393 .808 1.0 4.1 .9 .2 9.7 2012–13 Brooklyn 80 8 19.0 .418 .411 .780 1.8 2.0 .8 .2 6.8 2013–14 Indiana 63 5 18.9 .437 .366 .784 1.6 1.7 1.0 .1 6.6 2014–15 Indiana 57 21 24.9 .434 .400 .826 2.9 3.6 1.0 .2 10.0 2015–16 Orlando 33 2 19.9 .343 .292 .872 2.0 2.7 .6 .2 4.3 2016–17 Orlando 62 9 16.3 .387 .305 .864 1.4 1.8 .7 .0 4.5 Career 600 104 20.2 .419 .373 .812 1.9 2.5 .9 .1 7.2 Playoffs[edit] Year Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2011 Chicago 16 0 8.5 .339 .200 .909 .9 1.9 .5 .0 3.2 2012 Chicago 6 5 27.3 .241 .250 .750 2.2 5.5 .8 .0 7.3 2013 Brooklyn 7 0 23.0 .436 .267 .667 2.4 1.9 .7 .1 8.6 2014 Indiana 19 0 18.0 .411 .400 .607 2.1 .9 .8 .1 5.6 Career 48 5 16.7 .363 .314 .701 1.8 2.0 .7 .0 5.5 References[edit] ^ a b c "C.J.

Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), the chlorite (ClO2−) ion, and the triiodide (I3−) ion are examples of hypervalent molecules.

Musher in 1969 as molecules having central atoms of group 15–18 in any valence other than the lowest (i.e. 3, 2, 1, 0 for Groups 15, 16, 17, 18 respectively, based on the octet rule).[1] Several specific classes of hypervalent molecules exist: Hypervalent iodine compounds are useful reagents in organic chemistry (e.g. Dess–Martin periodinane) Tetra-, penta- and hexavalent phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur compounds (ex. PCl5, PF5, SF6, sulfuranes and persulfuranes) Noble gas compounds (ex. xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4) Halogen polyfluorides (ex. ClF5) N-X-L notation[edit] N-X-L nomenclature, introduced collaboratively by the research groups of Martin, Arduengo, and Kochi in 1980,[2] is often used to classify hypervalent compounds of main group elements, where: N represents the number of valence electrons X is the chemical symbol of the central atom L the number of ligands to the central atom Examples of N-X-L nomenclature include: XeF2, 10-Xe-2 PCl5, 10-P-5 SF6, 12-S-6 IF7, 14-I-7 History and controversy[edit] The debate over the nature and classification of hypervalent molecules goes back to Gilbert N. Lewis and Irving Langmuir and the debate over the nature of the chemical bond in the 1920s.[3] Lewis maintained the importance of the two-center two-electron (2c-2e) bond in describing hypervalence, thus using expanded octets to account for such molecules. Using the language of orbital hybridization, the bonds of molecules like PF5 and SF6 were said to be constructed from sp3dn orbitals on the central atom. Langmuir, on the other hand, upheld the dominance of the octet rule and preferred the use of ionic bonds to account for hypervalence without violating the rule (e.g. "SF42+ 2F−" for SF6). In the late 1920s and 1930s, Sugden argued for the existence of a two-center one-electron (2c-1e) bond and thus rationalized bonding in hypervalent molecules without the need for expanded octets or ionic bond character; this was poorly accepted at the time.[3] In the 1940s and 1950s, Rundle and Pimentel popularized the idea of the three-center four-electron bond, which is essentially the same concept which Sugden attempted to advance decades earlier; the three-center four-electron bond can be alternatively viewed as consisting of two collinear two-center one-electron bonds, with the remaining two nonbonding electrons localized to the ligands.[3] The attempt to actually prepare hypervalent organic molecules began with Hermann Staudinger and Georg Wittig in the first half of the twentieth century, who sought to challenge the extant valence theory and successfully prepare nitrogen and phosphorus-centered hypervalent molecules.[4] The theoretical basis for hypervalency was not delineated until J.I. Musher's work in 1969.[1] In 1990, Magnusson published a seminal work definitively excluding the significance of d-orbital hybridization in the bonding of hypervalent compounds of second-row elements. This had long been a point of contention and confusion in describing these molecules using molecular orbital theory. Part of the confusion here originates from the fact that one must include d-functions in the basis sets used to describe these compounds (or else unreasonably high energies and distorted geometries result), and the contribution of the d-function to the molecular wavefunction is large. These facts were historically interpreted to mean that d-orbitals must be involved in bonding. However, Magnusson concludes in his work that d-orbital involvement is not implicated in hypervalency.[5] Nevertheless, a 2013 study showed that although the Pimentel ionic model best accounts for the bonding of hypervalent species, the energetic contribution of an expanded octet structure is also not null. In this modern valence bond theory study of the bonding of xenon difluoride, it was found that ionic structures account for about 81% of the overall wavefunction, of which 70% arises from ionic structures employing only the p orbital on xenon while 11% arises from ionic structures employing an s d z 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {sd} _{z^{2}}} hybrid on xenon. The contribution of a formally hypervalent structure employing an orbital of sp3d hybridization on xenon accounts for 11% of the wavefunction, with a diradical contribution making up the remaining 8%. The 11% sp3d contribution results in a net stabilization of the molecule by 7.2 kcal (30 kJ) mol−1,[6] a minor but significant fraction of the total energy of the total bond energy (64 kcal (270 kJ) mol−1).[7] Other studies have similarly found minor but non-negligible energetic contributions from expanded octet structures in SF6 (17%) and XeF6 (14%).[8] Despite the lack of chemical realism, the IUPAC recommends the drawing of expanded octet structures for functional groups like sulfones and phosphoranes, in order to avoid the drawing of a large number of formal charges or partial single bonds.[9] Hypervalent hydrides[edit] A special type of hypervalent molecules is hypervalent hydrides. Most known hypervalent molecules contain substituents more electronegative than their central atoms[10][11]. Hypervalent hydrides are of special interest because hydrogen is usually less electronegative than the central atom. A number of computational studies have been performed on chalcogen hydrides[11][12][13][14][15][16] and pnictogen hydrides[17][18][19][20][21]. Recently, a new computational study has showed that most hypervalent halogen hydrides HalHn can exist. It is suggested that IH3 and IH5 are stable enough to be observable or, possibly, even isolable.[22] Criticism[edit] Both the term and concept of hypervalency still fall under criticism. In 1984, in response to this general controversy, Paul von Ragué Schleyer proposed the replacement of 'hypervalency' with use of the term hypercoordination because this term does not imply any mode of chemical bonding and the question could thus be avoided altogether.[3] The concept itself has been criticized by Ronald Gillespie who, based on an analysis of electron localization functions, wrote in 2002 that "as there is no fundamental difference between the bonds in hypervalent and non-hypervalent (Lewis octet) molecules there is no reason to continue to use the term hypervalent."[23] For hypercoordinated molecules with electronegative ligands such as PF5, it has been demonstrated that the ligands can pull away enough electron density from the central atom so that its net content is again 8 electrons or fewer. Consistent with this alternative view is the finding that hypercoordinated molecules based on fluorine ligands, for example PF5 do not have hydride counterparts e.g. phosphorane PH5 which is unknown. The ionic model holds up well in thermochemical calculations. It predicts favorable exothermic formation of PF4+F− from phosphorus trifluoride PF3 and fluorine F2 whereas a similar reaction forming PH4+H− is not favorable.[24] Alternative definition[edit] Durrant has proposed an alternative definition of hypervalency, based on the analysis of atomic charge maps obtained from atoms in molecules theory.[25] This approach defines a parameter called the valence electron equivalent, γ, as “the formal shared electron count at a given atom, obtained by any combination of valid ionic and covalent resonance forms that reproduces the observed charge distribution”. For any particular atom X, if the value of γ(X) is greater than 8, that atom is hypervalent. Using this alternative definition, many species such as PCl5, SO42−, and XeF4, that are hypervalent by Musher's definition, are reclassified as hypercoordinate but not hypervalent, due to strongly ionic bonding that draws electrons away from the central atom. On the other hand, some compounds that are normally written with ionic bonds in order to conform to the octet rule, such as ozone O3, nitrous oxide NNO, and trimethylamine N-oxide (CH3)3NO, are found to be genuinely hypervalent. Examples of γ calculations for phosphate PO43− (γ(P) = 2.6, non-hypervalent) and orthonitrate NO43− (γ(N) = 8.5, hypervalent) are shown below. Calculation of the valence electron equivalent for phosphate and orthonitrate Bonding in hypervalent molecules[edit] Early considerations of the geometry of hypervalent molecules returned familiar arrangements that were well explained by the VSEPR model for atomic bonding. Accordingly, AB5 and AB6 type molecules would possess a trigonal bi-pyramidal and octahedral geometry, respectively. However, in order to account for the observed bond angles, bond lengths and apparent violation of the Lewis octet rule, several alternative models have been proposed. In the 1950s an expanded valence shell treatment of hypervalent bonding was adduced to explain the molecular architecture, where the central atom of penta- and hexacoordinated molecules would utilize d AOs in addition to s and p AOs. However, advances in the study of ab initio calculations have revealed that the contribution of d-orbitals to hypervalent bonding is too small to describe the bonding properties, and this description is now regarded as much less important.[5] It was shown that in the case of hexacoordinated SF6, d-orbitals are not involved in S-F bond formation, but charge transfer between the sulfur and fluorine atoms and the apposite resonance structures were able to account for the hypervalency (See below). Additional modifications to the octet rule have been attempted to involve ionic characteristics in hypervalent bonding. As one of these modifications, in 1951, the concept of the 3-center 4-electron (3c-4e) bond, which described hypervalent bonding with a qualitative molecular orbital, was proposed. The 3c-4e bond is described as three molecular orbitals given by the combination of a p atomic orbital on the central atom and an atomic orbital from each of the two ligands on opposite sides of the central atom. Only one of the two pairs of electrons is occupying a molecular orbital that involves bonding to the central atom, the second pair being non-bonding and occupying a molecular orbital composed of only atomic orbitals from the two ligands. This model in which the octet rule is preserved was also advocated by Musher.[3] Qualitative model for a three-center four-electron bond Molecular orbital theory[edit] A complete description of hypervalent molecules arises from consideration of molecular orbital theory through quantum mechanical methods. An LCAO in, for example, sulfur hexafluoride, taking a basis set of the one sulfur 3s-orbital, the three sulfur 3p-orbitals, and six octahedral geometry symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of fluorine orbitals, a total of ten molecular orbitals are obtained (four fully occupied bonding MOs of the lowest energy, two fully occupied intermediate energy non-bonding MOs and four vacant antibonding MOs with the highest energy) providing room for all 12 valence electrons. This is a stable configuration only for SX6 molecules containing electronegative ligand atoms like fluorine, which explains why SH6 is not a stable molecule. In the bonding model, the two non-bonding MOs (1eg) are localized equally on all six fluorine atoms. Valence bond theory[edit] For hypervalent compounds in which the ligands are more electronegative than the central, hypervalent atom, resonance structures can be drawn with no more than four covalent electron pair bonds and completed with ionic bonds to obey the octet rule. For example, in phosphorus pentafluoride (PF5), 5 resonance structures can be generated each with four covalent bonds and one ionic bond with greater weight in the structures placing ionic character in the axial bonds, thus satisfying the octet rule and explaining both the observed trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry and the fact that the axial bond length (158 pm) is longer than the equatorial (154 pm).[26] Phosphorus pentafluoride. There are 2 structures with an axial ionic bond, plus 3 structures with an equatorial ionic bond. For a hexacoordinate molecule such as sulfur hexafluoride, each of the six bonds is the same length. The rationalization described above can be applied to generate 15 resonance structures each with four covalent bonds and two ionic bonds, such that the ionic character is distributed equally across each of the sulfur-fluorine bonds. Sulfur hexafluoride. There are 12 structures with the two ionic bonds in adjacent (cis) positions, plus 3 structures with the two ionic bonds in opposite (trans) positions. Spin-coupled valence bond theory has been applied to diazomethane and the resulting orbital analysis was interpreted in terms of a chemical structure in which the central nitrogen has five covalent bonds; Chemical formula of diazomethane, showing hypervalent nitrogen This led the authors to the interesting conclusion that "Contrary to what we were all taught as undergraduates, the nitrogen atom does indeed form five covalent linkages and the availability or otherwise of d-orbitals has nothing to do with this state of affairs."[27] Structure, reactivity, and kinetics[edit] Structure[edit] Hexacoordinated phosphorus[edit] Hexacoordinate phosphorus molecules involving nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur ligands provide examples of Lewis acid-Lewis base hexacoordination.[28] For the two similar complexes shown below, the length of the C-P bond increases with decreasing length of the N-P bond; the strength of the C-P bond decreases with increasing strength of the N-P Lewis acid-Lewis base interaction. Relative bond strengths in hexacoordinated phosphorus compounds. In A, the N-P bond is 1.980Å long and the C-P is 1.833Å long, and in B, the N-P bond increases to 2.013Å as the C-P bond decreases to 1.814Å.[28] Pentacoordinated silicon[edit] This trend is also generally true of pentacoordinated main-group elements with one or more lone-pair-containing ligand, including the oxygen-pentacoordinated silicon examples shown below. Relative bond strengths in pentacoordinated silicon compounds. In A, the Si-O bond length is 1.749Å and the Si-I bond length is 3.734Å; in B, the Si-O bond lengthens to 1.800Å and the Si-Br bond shortens to 3.122Å, and in C, the Si-O bond is the longest at 1.954Å and the Si-Cl bond the shortest at 2.307A.[28] The Si-halogen bonds range from close to the expected van der Waals value in A (a weak bond) almost to the expected covalent single bond value in C (a strong bond).[28] Reactivity[edit] Silicon[edit] Observed third-order reaction rate constantsfor hydrolysis (displacement of chloride from silicon)[29] Chlorosilane Nucleophile kobs (M−2s−1)at 20 °C in anisole Ph3SiCl HMPT 1200 Ph3SiCl DMSO 50 Ph3SiCl DMF 6 MePh2SiCl HMPT 2000 MePh2SiCl DMSO 360 MePh2SiCl DMF 80 Me(1-Np)PhSiCl HMPT 3500 Me(1-Np)PhSiCl DMSO 180 Me(1-Np)PhSiCl DMF 40 (1-Np)Ph(vinyl)SiCl HMPT 2200 (1-Np)Ph(vinyl)SiCl DMSO 90 (1-Np)(m-CF3Ph)HSiCl DMSO 1800 (1-Np)(m-CF3Ph)HSiCl DMF 300 Corriu and coworkers performed early work characterizing reactions thought to proceed through a hypervalent transition state.[29] Measurements of the reaction rates of hydrolysis of tetravalent chlorosilanes incubated with catalytic amounts of water returned a rate that is first order in chlorosilane and second order in water. This indicated that two water molecules interacted with the silane during hydrolysis and from this a binucleophilic reaction mechanism was proposed. Corriu and coworkers then measured the rates of hydrolysis in the presence of nucleophilic catalyst HMPT, DMSO or DMF. It was shown that the rate of hydrolysis was again first order in chlorosilane, first order in catalyst and now first order in water. Appropriately, the rates of hydrolysis also exhibited a dependence on the magnitude of charge on the oxygen of the nucleophile. Taken together this led the group to propose a reaction mechanism in which there is a pre-rate determining nucleophilic attack of the tetracoordinated silane by the nucleophile (or water) in which a hypervalent pentacoordinated silane is formed. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack of the intermediate by water in a rate determining step leading to hexacoordinated species that quickly decomposes giving the hydroxysilane. Silane hydrolysis was further investigated by Holmes and coworkers [30] in which tetracoordinated Mes2SiF2 (Mes = mesityl) and pentacoordinated Mes2SiF3− were reacted with two equivalents of water. Following twenty-four hours, almost no hydrolysis of the tetracoordinated silane was observed, while the pentacoordinated silane was completely hydrolyzed after fifteen minutes. Additionally, X-ray diffraction data collected for the tetraethylammonium salts of the fluorosilanes showed the formation of hydrogen bisilonate lattice supporting a hexacoordinated intermediate from which HF2− is quickly displaced leading to the hydroxylated product. This reaction and crystallographic data support the mechanism proposed by Corriu et al.. Mechanism of silane hydrolysis and structure of the hydrogen bisilonate lattice The apparent increased reactivity of hypervalent molecules, contrasted with tetravalent analogues, has also been observed for Grignard reactions. The Corriu group measured[31] Grignard reaction half-times by NMR for related 18-crown-6 potassium salts of a variety of tetra- and pentacoordinated fluorosilanes in the presence of catalytic amounts of nucleophile. Though the half reaction method is imprecise, the magnitudinal differences in reactions rates allowed for a proposed reaction scheme wherein, a pre-rate determining attack of the tetravalent silane by the nucleophile results in an equilibrium between the neutral tetracoordinated species and the anionic pentavalent compound. This is followed by nucleophilic coordination by two Grignard reagents as normally seen, forming a hexacoordinated transition state and yielding the expected product. Grignard reaction mechanism for tetracoordinate silanes and the analogous hypervalent pentacoordinated silanes The mechanistic implications of this are extended to a hexacoordinated silicon species that is thought to be active as a transition state in some reactions. The reaction of allyl- or crotyl-trifluorosilanes with aldehydes and ketones only precedes with fluoride activation to give a pentacoordinated silicon. This intermediate then acts as a Lewis acid to coordinate with the carbonyl oxygen atom. The further weakening of the silicon–carbon bond as the silicon becomes hexacoordinate helps drive this reaction.[32] Phosphorus[edit] Similar reactivity has also been observed for other hypervalent structures such as the miscellany of phosphorus compounds, for which hexacoordinated transition states have been proposed. Hydrolysis of phosphoranes and oxyphosphoranes have been studied [33] and shown to be second order in water. Bel'skii et al.. have proposed a prerate determining nucleophilic attack by water resulting in an equilibrium between the penta- and hexacoordinated phosphorus species, which is followed by a proton transfer involving the second water molecule in a rate determining ring-opening step, leading to the hydroxlyated product. Mechanism of the hydrolysis of pentacoordinated phosphorus Alcoholysis of pentacoordinated phosphorus compounds, such as trimethoxyphospholene with benzyl alcohol, have also been postulated to occur through a similar octahedral transition state, as in hydrolysis, however without ring opening.[34] Mechanism of the base catalyzed alcoholysis of pentacoordinated phosphorus It can be understood from these experiments that the increased reactivity observed for hypervalent molecules, contrasted with analogous nonhypervalent compounds, can be attributed to the congruence of these species to the hypercoordinated activated states normally formed during the course of the reaction. Ab initio calculations[edit] The enhanced reactivity at pentacoordinated silicon is not fully understood. Corriu and coworkers suggested that greater electropositive character at the pentavalent silicon atom may be responsible for its increased reactivity.[35] Preliminary ab initio calculations supported this hypothesis to some degree, but used a small basis set.[36] A software program for ab initio calculations, Gaussian 86, was used by Dieters and coworkers to compare tetracoordinated silicon and phosphorus to their pentacoordinate analogues. This ab initio approach is used as a supplement to determine why reactivity improves in nucleophilic reactions with pentacoordinated compounds. For silicon, the 6-31+G* basis set was used because of its pentacoordinated anionic character and for phosphorus, the 6-31G* basis set was used.[36] Pentacoordinated compounds should theoretically be less electrophilic than tetracoordinated analogues due to steric hindrance and greater electron density from the ligands, yet experimentally show greater reactivity with nucleophiles than their tetracoordinated analogues. Advanced ab initio calculations were performed on series of tetracoordinated and pentacoordinated species to further understand this reactivity phenomenon. Each series varied by degree of fluorination. Bond lengths and charge densities are shown as functions of how many hydride ligands are on the central atoms. For every new hydride, there is one less fluoride.[36] For silicon and phosphorus bond lengths, charge densities, and Mulliken bond overlap, populations were calculated for tetra and pentacoordinated species by this ab initio approach.[36] Addition of a fluoride ion to tetracoordinated silicon shows an overall average increase of 0.1 electron charge, which is considered insignificant. In general, bond lengths in trigonal bipyramidal pentacoordinate species are longer than those in tetracoordinate analogues. Si-F bonds and Si-H bonds both increase in length upon pentacoordination and related effects are seen in phosphorus species, but to a lesser degree. The reason for the greater magnitude in bond length change for silicon species over phosphorus species is the increased effective nuclear charge at phosphorus. Therefore, silicon is concluded to be more loosely bound to its ligands.Effects of fluorine substitution on positive charge densityComparison of Charge Densities with Degree of Fluorination for Tetra and Pentacoordinated Silicon In addition Dieters and coworkers [36] show an inverse correlation between bond length and bond overlap for all series. Pentacoordinated species are concluded to be more reactive because of their looser bonds as trigonal-bipyramidal structures.Calculated bond length and bond overlap with degree of fluorinationComparison of Bond Lengths with Degree of Fluorination for Tetra and Pentacoordinated SiliconComparison of Bond Lengths with Degree of Fluorination for Tetra and Pentacoordinated Phosphorus By calculating the energies for the addition and removal of a fluoride ion in various silicon and phosphorus species, several trends were found. In particular, the tetracoordinated species have much higher energy requirements for ligand removal than do pentacoordinated species. Further, silicon species have lower energy requirements for ligand removal than do phosphorus species, which is an indication of weaker bonds in silicon.

Mental facts are ultimately caused by physical facts, in that mental facts depend on physical and biological functions which are required for consciousness.[1] The physical and biological processes which are necessary for consciousness enable conscious individuals to recognize physical and mental facts.[2] Thus, mental facts are based on physical facts, and both physical and mental facts are required for the construction of social reality.[3] According to John Searle, mental facts may be intentional or nonintentional, depending on whether or not they are directed at something.[4] See also[edit] Brute fact is and ought problem - the distinction between factual claims and value or normative claims matter of fact and matter of law Notes[edit] ^ A DEFENCE OF COMMON SENSE by G.

It is sometimes referred to as the Tonti derailment. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the derailment was caused by a false flange on a flat wheel caused by a seized axle bearing. The crash killed 11 people and injured 163. It was Amtrak's first train crash.[4] Photo of the Tonti derailment References[edit] ^ "Tonti, Illinois". Geographic Names Information System.

The size of the arena was about a half acre, hence its name. When it opened, it was one of the nation's largest indoor arenas. The venue is currently a recreation center on the campus of the University of Wyoming. In 2012, the university announced a $27 million renovation to begin in the Spring of 2013, and be completed by the Fall of 2014.[1] The project was completed in two phases. Phase One would consist of the demolition and recreation of the east portion of the building, and Phase Two would include the reopening of the east portion, and the closure and construction of the west portion which is the historical section of the building. Throughout the renovation, the university hoped to keep and incorporate as much of the historical structure and facade as possible.[2] The improvements, according to the University of Wyoming's web site, included elevators, added classrooms, a space for athletic training, new racquetball courts, a climbing wall for bouldering, a dance studio, athletics track, and new locker rooms with access to the pool.[2][3] Amenities[edit] Aquatics[edit] Pool area Corbett gym and pool[edit] Corbett gym – basketball/volleyball courts and badminton courts Corbett pool – 25 yard by 25 meter L-shaped pool with a diving well Historic gym[edit] basketball/volleyball courts badminton courts MAC gym[edit] basketball/volleyball courts badminton courts Indoor soccer/Futsal racquetball courts with convertible squash court Miscellaneous[edit] 1/8 mile, four-lane track [4] References[edit] ^ "UW to renovate, expand Half Acre Gym for $27 million".

Contents 1 Course 2 Water utilisation 3 References 4 External links Course[edit] The Ujh river originates in Kailash mountains (near Bhaderwah hills, part of the Pir Panjal Range) at an altitude of 4,300 metres (14,100 ft). It flows a distance of nearly 100 kilometres (62 mi), some of it in Pakistani Punjab, before joining Ravi near Chak Ram Sahai in Indian Punjab.[1] The average width of the river in the plains is about 1.2 kilometres (0.75 mi).[2] Four streams, Bhini, Sutar, Dunarki and Talan join Ujh at Panjtirthi. Ujh and Bhini are perennial rivers. The rest are seasonal.[1] At Karandi Khurd (32°24′38″N 75°23′57″E﻿ / ﻿32.4106°N 75.3991°E﻿ / 32.4106; 75.3991), the Ujh river spins off a 'western branch', which joins back with the main branch near Gharotta in Pakistani Punjab (32°16′39″N 75°20′35″E﻿ / ﻿32.2774°N 75.3430°E﻿ / 32.2774; 75.3430). Even though it is but a small stream, the western branch achieved notability as Cyril Radcliffe defined the India–Pakistan border to follow the course of this branch until reaching the trijunction of the Shakargarh, Pathankot and Gurdaspur tehsils. From the trijunction, the border was to follow the tehsil boundaries.[3] Water utilisation[edit] The water of Ujh river is used for drinking, irrigation and to feed a number of small canals and khuls of the district. It is also used to transport timber from hills to the plains and provides construction materials such as sand and stones.[2] Ujh Barrage has been constructed on this river at Jasrota village (32°28′22″N 75°25′03″E﻿ / ﻿32.4728°N 75.4174°E﻿ / 32.4728; 75.4174).[2] A new Ujh dam is proposed higher up the course of the river as it passes through the outer hills (32°33′48″N 75°29′16″E﻿ / ﻿32.5633°N 75.4878°E﻿ / 32.5633; 75.4878). The dam is projected to store 925 million cubic metres of water and generate 196 MW of electricity.[4][5] References[edit] ^ a b Jain, Sharad K.; Agarwal, Pushpendra K.; Singh, Vijay P.

Perfect Stranger is known for his own distinctive sound, characterised by beats and patiently built compositions. His music often defies genres,[2] bridging between progressive trance and techno[3] with a presence of tribal and psychedelic elements.[4] Fershtat released 8 albums, both as 'BLT' and as Perfect Stranger and a long list of 12”, EPs and compilation tracks and compiled few compilations.[5] He is also the owner of the 'Digital Structures' label, which he bought in 2011,[6] and since then has been releasing music by himself and others on it.[7] Contents 1 Music 1.1 Musical Background and Influences 1.2 Early Years - BLT 1.3 Perfect Stranger 2 Discography - BLT 2.1 Albums 2.2 Singles & EPs 2.3 Appearances 3 Discography - Perfect Stranger 3.1 Albums 3.2 Compilations 3.3 Singles & EPs 3.4 Appearances 3.5 Remixes 4 Festivals 5 References Music[edit] Musical Background and Influences[edit] Fershtat was surrounded by music since his birth coming from a family of classical pianists, and studied piano from the age of four.[8] He stated as musical influences psychedelic progressive rock, such as King Crimson, Genesis (band), Jethro Tull (band) dipped in some hard rock, such as Led Zeppelin & Deep Purple and some Blues.[9] He also mentioned Jean Michel Jarre’s Oxygène as critical to his musical development and interest in electronic music.[10] In 1992/93 he visited India and Goa and discovered Electronic Psychedelic music (which he hated till that time and greatly admired since).[11] Another visit to Goa in 1994/95 solidified his interest in Goa Trance and Psychedelic Trance. During these years, Fershtat did not write music but was traveling the world and playing guitar, jamming with other musicians he met on the road.[12] Early Years - BLT[edit] Fershtat started producing after his friends bought him a synthesizer for his 27th birthday.[13] Intuitively he was drawn to produce psychedelic trance since he was very much involved with it at the time and felt close to the rhythms and the atmosphere that it produced, and believing that tribal music such as psychedelic trance is essential for people to unite.[14] He chose the name BLT, which stood for a favourite sandwich of his, to show a lack of ego in music, and that the name itself and what it says are not the important thing, as a kind of antithesis to blasting names, which a lot of groups use, especially in the trance scene.[15] The first BLT album Alchemic Anecdote was released on the Tel Aviv-based label 'Krembo Records' in 1999. His 2nd album, Presence was released on 'HOM-Mega Productions' in the following year.[16] BLT 3rd album, God is Love, featured more down-tempo music, with groovy and more complex rhythms, and was released in 2002, also on 'HOM-Mega Productions'. During that time period Fershtat started working with Danni Makov - former drummer of Nikmat HaTraktor, an Israeli rock band, and one of the most important drummers in Israeli Rock.[17] Together the two put on a live show, where the drummer play part of the set, that now felt more alive.[18] Afterwards the duo extended their work and put out a 4th BLT album, Anything U Want on the label Tokyo Dance in 2004.[19] Perfect Stranger[edit] In 2005 Fershtat decided to bring an end to the BLT project as he no longer citing lack of overseas bookings and his interest in Acupuncture and Chinese medicine as the main reasons. Then Michael Abel-Larsen, one of the owners of Iboga Records, suggested he produce music with slower BPM tempo.[20] He chose the name Perfect Stranger because of a Goa track by that name by Sandman and the Deep Purple song of the same name.[21] The first Perfect Stranger album, Learning = Change was released in the Danish record label Iboga Records, in 2006, and a remixes/collaborations album named Changed was released the year after and featured some of the most important artists in the progressive trance world at the time,[22] including Atmos, Vibrasphere, Ace Ventura and Antix, who remixed some of Perfect Stranger tracks, while he remixed some of theirs.[23] Free Cloud, the third Perfect Stranger's album, and Fershtat`s seventh album altogether, was released late in 2008, and is the album that brought him worldwide attention[24] that crossed genres and scenes and is considered by many to be his best album yet.[25] The inspiration for the album title was based on David Bowie`s song, as Fershtat claimed he " felt like that Wild Eyed Boy from Free Cloud, that David Bowie used to sing about 35 years ago".[26] Free Cloud was characterized by monotone, "technoidic feel", and cross over between genres[27] as Fershtat used the best parts in from the genres that inspired him, mostly techno.[28][29][30] Perfect Stranger’s fourth album, Leap of Faith came out in 2012, also on Iboga Records. The album consists of 3 CDs. The 1st containing new compositions including collaborations with Eat Static, Liquid Soul & Loud;[31] the 2nd consists of new versions and live edits to already released tracks and the 3rd is a recording of a live set at the Indigo Festival, at the Sea of Galilee, Israel, in May 2012.[32] Throughout the years Perfect Stranger has performed live and as a DJ in many leading electronic music festivals worldwide. Thus, Perfect Stranger played Glade Festival UK in 2008[33] and 2009,[34] Symbiosis Gathering in California at 2009,[35] 2012,[36] 2013.[37] Perfect Stranger played most of Europe`s trance festivals including Boom Festival in Portugal where he played in every edition since 2010,[38] Antaris Project in 2010[39] and 2012,[40] Ozora Festival in 2012,[41] and many more. Perfect stranger is also very popular in Australia,[42] playing there at the Rainbow Serpent Festival in 2009,[43] 2011[44] and 2015,[45] as well as in Maitreya Festival in 2010[46] and 2014,[47] Strawberry Fields Festival 2011 and 2012, Subsonic Festival in 2011[48] & 2013[49] and the Eclipse Festival in 2012.[50] He also performed extensively in big festivals in Central and South America including Universo Paralello Festival in Brazil 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013,[51][52] as well as in festivals in South Africa, New Zealand, Canada and many more.

His major field of research was signal transduction therapy and he participated in the development of novel drug discovery technologies and drug candidates that entered the clinical development process.[1] Contents 1 Biography 2 History 3 Research 4 Membership of scientific organizations 5 Editorial board memberships 6 Awards 7 Main publications 8 Sources Biography[edit] He studied chemistry at the Eötvös Loránd University (Budapest), where he graduated in 1973 and received a PhD in biochemistry in 1976. He worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of California, San Francisco in 1978-1979. As a visiting scientist he returned to the United States 19 times for various time periods on the bases of a National Science Foundation grant and joint research programs with University of California, San Francisco and Sugen. From the Hungarian Academy of Sciences he received Candidatus of Biological Sciences (C.Sc.) in 1982 and Doctor of Biological Sciences (D.Sc.) in 1994. In 1997 he became Dr. Med. Habil. of the Semmelweis University. He was married to Mária Kenéz, has two children (Csaba 1976 and Júlia 1980) and a granddaughter Luca (2008). History[edit] 1979-1988: Research scientist and Senior research scientist of First Institute of Biochemistry, Semmelweis University Medical School and Hungarian Academy of Sciences 1988-1994: Head of Peptide Research Laboratory, Associate Professor of Biochemistry, Joint Research Organization of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University Medical School, The First Institute of Biochemistry 1994-2008: Head of Peptide Biochemistry Research Group and Rational Drug Design Laboratory, Professor of Biochemistry, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Semmelweis Medical University 1992-1999: Scientific advisor of Sugen 1999-2005: Scientific advisor of Axxima Pharmaceuticals 1999–present: CEO and CSO of Vichem Chemie Research Ltd. 2001-2012: Chairman of Rational Drug Design Laboratories Co-operation Research Center, Semmelweis University 2002-2008: Curator of Office for Subsidised Research Units of Hungarian Academy of Sciences 2008-2012: Head of Signal Transduction Therapy Laboratory at Semmelweis University 2012–present: Head of Pathobiochemistry Research Group of Hungarian Academy of Sciences at Semmelweis University, Department of Medical Chemistry Research[edit] György Kéri was an internationally recognized expert on signal transduction therapy and personalized therapy. His pioneering work focused on the utilization of signal transduction therapy approach in the pharmaceutical research. He achieved outstanding results in the research and development of peptide hormone derivatives and kinase inhibitors as antitumor agents. He was involved in the development of a signal-inhibiting somatostatin peptide compound (TT-232), which reached Phase II clinical trials, and SU101, which reached Phase III clinical trials. Vichem – the company he co-founded in 1999 – developed a kinase inhibitor library, and a hit finding technology called Nested Chemical Library™ technology and an allosteric library for inhibiting protein-protein interactions. He has developed at Vichem the DriverHit Library™ for inhibiting the signaling pathways activated by cancer driver genes or mutated tumor suppressor genes. He also participated with German researchers in the development of a new proteomic technology (Target Fishing technology) which makes it possible to identify unknown targets in the signal transduction network or the interacting enzymes of the metabolom.

The company is headquartered in Hyannis, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. Cape Cod Potato Chips is a subsidiary of Snyder's-Lance.

History[edit] Cape Cod Potato Chips was founded in 1980 by Steve Bernard and his brother, Jude, with the idea of offering healthier foods made with little processing. Steve's wife, Lynn had opened the store, Ardklin Natural Foods, in Harwich in the 1970s. Bernard lamented the lack of healthy snacks. He pursued adding potato chips to the mix after tasting a natural potato chip from a successful company based in Hawaii. In 1980, he sold his auto parts business in for a potato chip business. He bought an 800-square-foot (74 m2) storefront in Hyannis, Massachusetts, in a prime place to reach tourists, as well as an industrial potato slicer for $3,000. He had almost no knowledge of the snack food business other than what he learned in a week-long course on potato chip making at Martin's Potato Chips in Thomasville, Pennsylvania.[2] Nauset Light (2015), the inspiration for the company's logo Unlike typical commercial brands made using a continuous frying process, in which potato slices travel through a tub of oil on a conveyor belt, Cape Cod chips are cooked in batches in kettles, frying them in a shallow vat in oil while stirring with a rake, producing a crunchier chip. Snack Food Association president James A. McCarthy noted that Bernard "didn't invent the kettle chip, but he was involved in bringing it back to prominence."[1] Before the 1920s, this was the way potato chips had been made. The company struggled for months after it opened on July 4, 1980. The following winter a car crashed through the front window of the store, just missing Steve's daughter and wife. An insurance payment and publicity from the accident helped tide the company over until the following summer, by which time sales were substantial, and the company's chips were being sold through a number of supermarket chains.[1] The company was acquired by Anheuser-Busch in 1985, and operated as a division of its Eagle Snacks unit. Sales of the chips were up to 80,000 bags a day by the end of the following year, reaching the entire East Coast, with sales of $16 million annually.[2] Bernard bought the company and its factory back from Anheuser-Busch in 1996.[3] Snack food company Lance Inc. bought the company from Bernard in 1999, by which time annual sales had reached $30 million.[4] In 2010, Lance Inc. merged with Snyder's of Hanover.[5] The Campbell Soup Co. would later go on to acquire Snyder's of Hanover in December of 2017.[6] Flavors[edit] Current varieties[edit] Sea Salt & Vinegar Original 40% Reduced Fat Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper Sweet Mesquite Barbecue Sweet & Spicy Jalapeño 40% Less Fat Aged White Cheddar & Sour Cream 40% Less Fat Sea Salt & Vinegar 40% Less Fat Sweet Mesquite Barbeque 40% Less Fat Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper Limited Batch Back Bay Crab Limited Batch Asiago and Herb Limited Batch Chipotle Barbecue Limited Batch New England Bisque Waffle Cut Sea Salt Waffle Cut Barbecue Ranch Waffle Cut Buffalo Cheddar Waffle Cut Farm Stand Ranch Limited batch Firecracker BBQ Limited batch Russet Popcorn[edit] Kettle Corn Sea Salt White Cheddar Discontinued[edit] Beachside Barbecue Feta and Rosemary Firecracker Barbecue Honey Dijon Sour Cream & Green Onion Buttermilk Ranch Jalapeño & Aged Cheddar Russet (Golden, Dark (reintroduced in 2020 as a limited production product), and Robust)[7] Parmesan & Roasted Garlic Harvest Gold Five Cheese No Salt Waves (Original, Reduced Fat, and Golden Russet) Sweet Potato (Lightly Salted and Cinnamon & Sugar) Sierra Gold "Whole Earth" line Sour Cream & Chive Other past snacks[edit] Mild and Medium Black Bean and Corn Salsa Mild and Hot Salsa Dill and Herb Mix French Onion Dip Tortilla Chips (White Corn, Blue Sesame, Garlic Herb, Veggie) Tortilla Strips (Yellow Corn) Low-Carb Tortilla Strips Popcorn (Sweet & Salty, Sweet Cream Butter) Lighthouse Pretzels In popular culture[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

The russet potatoes we cook have been stored at a cool temperature so the starch will turn to sugar and the sugar will brown when we cook them. The russets are not cooked longer than the white potato chips - they actually cook a little faster. We had trouble getting the starch to turn to sugar, mostly caused by weather conditions (we were getting Golden Russets that are white or we would get them too dark - the Dark Russets were coming in too light -not many people complain about them being too dark). So marketing and production got together with the farmers and came up with the robust russets - this should let us have a bit more control over the russet potatoes." ^ https://genius.com/4779421/Lil-wayne-no-haters/Pockets-lookin-like-the-blob-chips-like-cape-cod ^ Severson, Kim (2007-07-04).

However, it was formed as a musical genre in the Levant, mainly in the city of Aleppo. It was developed by the musicians in Aleppo, based on secular, folk and religious songs. During the 20th century, Qudud Halabiya further developed and popularized by many Aleppine musicians including Omar al-Batsh (1885–1950), Abdul Qader al-Hajjar (1917–1993), Bakri al-Kurdi (1909–1978), Bakri Rajab (1910–1979), Sabri Moudallal (1918-2006), Sabah Fakhri (1933-), Mohammad Khairy (1935-1981), etc.[3] Contemporary Qudud Halabiya performers include Mohammad Qadri Dallal, Shadi Jamil, Nihad Najjar, Hamam Khairy, Shahd Barmada, Nadya Manfukh, Subhi Toufic, Ahmad Azrak etc. Famous songs[edit] "Ya Tira Tiri"[edit] "Ya Tira Tiri Ya Hamama" (Fly, fly away, my dove)[4] has been famously sung by Fairouz and Sabah Fakhri.

BiorBorn1981Bor, Sudan (now South Sudan) NationalitySudaneseCitizenshipAmericanEducationPoint Park University Panther Garang Bior is one of the 27,000 Lost Boys of Sudan. His journey was featured in the National Geographic Society's 2006 award-winning documentary, God Grew Tired of Us (executive produced by Brad Pitt and narrated by Nicole Kidman). Biography[edit] Panther was born in the village of Mareng in Bor, Sudan (now in South Sudan) in 1981. In the late 1980s, Panther was far from his home watching cattle when his village was attacked by the Muslim Sudanese Government. Escaping to the jungle, Bior, along with the other Lost Boys, spent the next five years trekking more than 1,000 miles barefoot throughout Kenya and Ethiopia, seeking refuge from the genocide, disease, and starvation.[1] In an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Panther described the hellish journey, "We were told to run east, through the desert, to Ethiopia," he says. "We were surviving by drinking the muddy water, and from the backs of leaves and whatever fruit we could find, maybe a little bit of grass. Many people lost their lives." Panther went on to describe how his best friend had been killed by a lion and his young nephew didn't survive the journey because his feet were torn up by the miles of walking, "We had to leave him in the desert," Bior says. "He died."[2] Finally arriving at Kakuma's refugee camp in Kenya, the Lost Boys' numbers had been dramatically decreased. In 2001, assisted by Catholic Charities, Panther was relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania along with a number of other Lost Boys to start a new life in the United States. Today[edit] Since first stepping foot on American soil, Panther Bior has been arduously working to get established in a new culture while struggling with a myriad of mixed emotions: Interviewed in the Pittsburgh Catholic, Panther said, "It gives one hope. Now we are in America. But we think of when we were in the desert, with no clothes. I flash back to how my brothers missed the chance to come to America...I have tears of joy and tears of sorrow," he said.[3] In 2005, Panther traveled back to Africa to marry his girlfriend, Nyanthiec. After the wedding he returned to the United States to fill out the necessary paperwork and begin the financial struggles of bringing his wife to the U.S.. Three years later, he brought her back to the United States. Bior is currently living with his wife and two children in Pittsburgh. Graduating from Point Park University with a B.S. in Accounting, Panther is pursuing his master degree in Organizational Leadership. Bior worked for the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) as an accounting analyst. Panther currently works at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. As featured in the "Take Action" section of God Grew Tired of Us, Bior is intent upon building a school in his home village of Mareng. In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Panther is quoted as saying, "We need connections, just like the connections that brought us over from Africa."[4] With such connections and now armed with a solid education, Panther has high hopes for the future of his homeland. "My country’s rich, got a lot of oil, got a lot of gold. But our people don’t know how to exploit them. So I have to come there, build a school, tell people the direction. And I can tell there’s--there’s improvement I’m bringing in the world."[5] Panther is partnering with Heaven's Family, an international ministry based out of Pittsburgh, in an effort to build a school in his homeland.

The estate includes the village of Yanworth. The main house is a Grade II* listed building and surrounded by extensive parkland, a mill, and church. The landscaped park is listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Contents 1 History 2 Architecture 3 Grounds 4 References 5 External links History[edit] The house was built around 1600 for Robert Atkinson, on the site of a previous house.[1] The manor is first recorded in 1086 when it was held by the Archbishop of York [2]. The house is Grade II* listed.[3] The Church of St Leonard was the chapel for the owners of the previous house, having been built in the 12th century.[4] The church has been described as "of very great interest, as it contains quite well-preserved fragments of twelfth-century wall-paintings".[5] The estate was passed to relatives of Atkinson until 1685 when it was bought by John Grubham Howe whose descendants owned the estate until 1811 when it was bought by the judge William Scott.[3] He took the title of Baron Stowell from the estate when raised to the peerage upon the coronation of George IV in 1821.[6] On his death in 1824 the estate was inherited by his brother John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon and passed down through the family until sold in 1923 to 1st Lord Vestey,[3] whose great grandson Sam Vestey, 3rd Lord Vestey, is the current head of the family and Chairman of the Vestey Group. During World War II Stowell Park was used for evacuees from Great Ballard School.[7] Architecture[edit] The main house is "L" shaped. The west front is Elizabethan and has five bays as does the north front. Each is surmounted by hipped and crenellated roofs.[3] The west front includes a door with paired Roman Doric pilasters.[8] The current main entrance on the south front was added in the 19th century.[3] The drawing room has panelling remaining from the 16th century.[8] Within the grounds is a 17th-century dovecote.[9] The former mill powered by water from the River Coln was built in the late 18th century.[10] The Lodge, iron gates and gate piers at the eastern entrance to the estate were added in the late 19th century,[11] when balustrades and steps were added between the house and the lawns.[12] The stable block, which was probably designed by Sir John Belcher, was also added in the late 19th century.[13] Grounds[edit] The grounds include terraced lawns with surrounding herbaceous borders. There are walled gardens containing fruit and flower beds. It is opened for the National Gardens Scheme each year.[14] The landscaped park is listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.[15] The estate hosts shoots for pheasants.[16] It has also been the home of a polo team with one of the players being the Argentine born Héctor Barrantes.[17] References[edit] ^ "Stowell Park".

The character, who Eugeni d'Ors compared with Don Quixote, used to walk through the dusty paths and alleys of the Catalan county of Ampurdan, while directing the tramuntana, the north wind, with a cane.

Opened to serve Teesside Steelworks, it is located on the Tees Valley Line and was latterly managed by Northern. In 2017/18 it was the least used station in Britain, with an estimated 40 passenger entries/exits.[1] Due to the fact that the British Steel site is no longer publicly accessible, Northern suspended all services to and from the station in December 2019.[2][3] Contents 1 History 2 Services 3 References 4 External links History[edit] The station opened on 19 June 1978[4] and is situated on a re-sited portion of route that was commissioned on that date by British Rail to allow the previous alignment to be used for an expansion of the steelworks site. This included a station at Warrenby Halt that the current structure replaced.[5] According to the Strategic Rail Authority, only 486 entries and exits were recorded for the station during the 2004–05 period, mainly due to there being no public access to and from the station (it being located on Tata Steel Europe property) and also due to the limited service. However, the numbers had increased to 1,570 entries and exits by the 2014–15 period. The majority of the steelworks, including the Redcar blast furnace, Redcar and South Bank coke ovens and the BOS plant at Lackenby, closed in 2015, resulting in a drop in passenger usage of the station from the previous year. In the 2016–17 period the entries and exits dropped to only 50, becoming the fourth least used station in Britain.[6] In the 2017–18 period, it was the least used station in Britain with only 40 passengers, surpassing Barry Links.[1] Work is beginning on regenerating the site of the former steelworks by the South Tees Development Corporation. As part of their vision they are hoping to revamp the station and improve the service frequency.[7] Services ceased to call at the station from 14 December 2019.[8] The station received a boost in its usage figures during the 2018-19 period, recording 360 up from 40 during the previous period. This is highly likely to be as a result of its then title of Britain's 'least used railway station'.[9] Services[edit] [ vte ]Route 3: Tees Valley Line Legend Bishop Auckland Shildon Newton Aycliffe Heighington North Road Darlington Dinsdale Allens West Thornaby Middlesbrough South Bank Redcar Central Redcar East Longbeck Marske Saltburn At the time of its suspension there were two trains in each direction Monday to Saturday.

The title phrase uncleftish beholding calques "atomic theory."[4] To illustrate, the text begins:[5] For most of its being, mankind did not know what things are made of, but could only guess. With the growth of worldken, we began to learn, and today we have a beholding of stuff and work that watching bears out, both in the workstead and in daily life. It goes on to define firststuffs (chemical elements), such as waterstuff (hydrogen), sourstuff (oxygen), and ymirstuff (uranium), as well as bulkbits (molecules), bindings (compounds), and several other terms important to uncleftish worldken (atomic science).[6] Wasserstoff and Sauerstoff are the modern German words for hydrogen and oxygen, and in Dutch the modern equivalents are waterstof and zuurstof.[7] Sunstuff refers to helium, which derives from ἥλιος, the Ancient Greek word for "sun." Ymirstuff references Ymir, a giant in Norse mythology similar to Uranus in Greek mythology. The vocabulary used in Uncleftish Beholding does not completely derive from Anglo-Saxon. Around, from Old French reond (Modern French rond), completely displaced Old English ymbe (modern English umbe (now obsolete), cognate to German um and Latin ambi-) and left no "native" English word for this concept. The text also contains the French-derived words rest, ordinary and sort. The text gained increased exposure and popularity after being circulated around the Internet, and has served as inspiration for some inventors of Germanic English conlangs. Douglas Hofstadter, in discussing the piece in his book Le Ton beau de Marot, jocularly refers to the use of only Germanic roots for scientific pieces as "Ander-Saxon."

He is the recipient of various awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship[1] and the American Academy in Rome's Rome Prize awarded to artists for a year-long residency in Rome.[2] Contents 1 Life 2 Music 2.1 Chamber Works 2.2 Orchestral Works 2.3 Symphonic Band 2.4 Choral Works 2.5 Songs 2.6 Solo Instrument 3 References 4 External links Life[edit] Bermel earned his B.A. at Yale University and later studied at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with William Bolcom and William Albright.[3] He also studied with Louis Andriessen in Amsterdam and Henri Dutilleux at Tanglewood. Later, his interest in a wide range of musical cultures sent him to Jerusalem to study ethnomusicology with André Hajdu, Bulgaria to investigate Thracian folk style with Nikola Iliev, Brazil to learn caxixi with Julio Góes, and to Ghana to study Lobi xylophone with Ngmen Baaru.[4] Bermel's output includes pieces for a variety of performing forces, including solo vocal songs, pieces for large and small chamber ensembles, and fourteen orchestral works.[5] Though the ensembles he writes for are largely classical, his voice as a composer has been heavily influenced by both his travels and his education in Western art and popular music. His orchestral work A shout, a whisper, and a trace is a good example of this interplay, as it draws on Bermel's knowledge of the Thracian folk style and the work of fellow ethnomusicologist and classical composer Béla Bartók. Moreover, the piece engages directly with the experience of living in an unfamiliar culture, drawing on Bartók's letters home from New York during the last five years of his life.[6] He first came into the national spotlight with works like Natural Selection, a series of animal portraits for baritone and ensemble, and Voices, a concerto for clarinet and orchestra which he wrote for himself to perform. The piece was premiered by the American Composers Orchestra under the baton of the composer/conductor Tan Dun and has since been performed by many other ensembles and conductors, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the baton of composer/conductor John Adams. Other important works include his "Migration Series," a piece for jazz band and orchestra that draws on impressions of Jacob Lawrence's set of 60 paintings by the same name depicting the mass movement of African-Americans from the South to the North at the beginning of the 20th century,[7] and "Soul Garden," a viola solo accompanied by string quintet that utilizes quarter-tones and slides to emulate the vocal effects of a gospel singer.[8][9] "Soul Garden" in particular reflects what Richard Scheinen, jazz writer for the San Jose Mercury News, has called Bermel's preoccupation with "the human voice--or more generally, language and the yearning the communicate.".[10] This artistic concern is equally evident in lighter pieces such as "Language Instruction," a humorous work for clarinet, viola, cello, and piano in which the clarinet plays the role of the voice on a language tape and the other three instruments students with various degrees of aptitude for the task at hand.[11] Bermel is also an accomplished clarinetist and plays both classical repertoire and rock and funk, performing with groups such as his own TONK. He also sings and plays keyboards and caxixi in the rock band Peace by Piece.[12] He has premiered and performed numerous pieces with large orchestras, including his own concerto Voices and John Adams Gnarly Buttons with the composer at the podium.[13] Besides his work as a composer and performer, Bermel is active as a teacher. He founded and served as director of the New York Youth Symphony's Making Score workshop for young composers. The workshop meets twice a month at the ASCAP to study orchestration and composition. The group and has heard from guest lecturers such as Meredith Monk, Steve Reich, and John Corigliano and had pieces read by ensembles such as the American Composers Orchestra.[14] More recently, he has mentored both young composers and conductors at Carnegie Hall through the Weill Music Institute.[15] Bermel also conducts masterclasses at universities and music festivals such as the University of Michigan, University of Chicago, Yale University, Peabody Conservatory, Bowdoin, Tanglewood, and Aspen.[16] Bermel's music is published by Peer Music Classical in the United States and is distributed in Europe, Australia and New Zealand by Faber Music.[17] Bermel began a three-year residency with the American Composers Orchestra in Fall of 2006 and currently serves on the ACO board.[18] In 2009 Bermel began his three-year tenure as composer-in-residence with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra[19] as well as his position as artist-in-residence at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he currently lives and works.[20] Music[edit] Chamber Works[edit] Large chamber ensemble: Canzonas Americanas (2010) Swing Song (2009) In Tangle (2005) Three Rivers (2001) Continental Divide (1996) Hot Zone (1995) Small chamber ensemble: Passing Through (2007), string quartet Twin Trio (2005), flute, clarinet, and piano Tied Shifts (2004), flute, clarinet, violin, cello, piano, and percussion Language Instruction (2003), clarinet, violin, cello, and piano Catcalls (2003), brass quintet Soul Garden (2000), viola + 2 violins, viola, 2 cellos Coming Together (1999), clarinet and cello God's Trombones (1998), 3 trombones and percussion Oct Up (1995), double string quartet Wanderings (1994), flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon SchiZm (1994), clarinet/oboe and piano String Quartet (1992), string quartet Mulatash Stomp (1991), violin, clarinet, and piano Sonata Humana (1991), clarinet and piano Orchestral Works[edit] A Shout, A Whisper, and a Trace (2009) Elixir (2006) Migration Series (2006) Slides (2003) Tag Rag (2003) The Ends (2002) Thracian Echoes (2002) Dust Dances (1994) With a solo instrument or voice: Mar de Setembro (2011), mezzo-soprano and chamber orchestra Ritornello (2011), electric guitar concerto The Good Life (2008), soprano, baritone, choir, and orchestra Turning Variations (2006), piano concerto The Sting (2001-2) - (narr, orch) Voices (1997), clarinet concerto Symphonic Band[edit] Ides March (2005) Choral Works[edit] A Child's War (2005) Kpanlongo (1993) Pete Pete (1993) Songs[edit] Solo voice: Nature Calls (1999), medium voice and piano Cabaret Songs (1998), soprano and piano See How She Moves (1997), solo medium voice Three Songs on Poems by Wendy S.

They are mainly worn as a fashion statement for the subculture of cybergoth. Mixed with both influences from America and the United Kingdom's versions of techno and other electronic music, cybergoths tend to dress in bright colors, neon lights, lots of plastic, loud, or costume jewelry known as "kandi" and one of the most essential items is fake hair. Synthetic dreads or falls are most commonly seen in the cybergoth and cyberpunk fashion and are easily accessorized with LED threads of light, yarn, wool, tubed crin, (more commonly known as Cyberlocks), beads and more. Contents 1 Categories of Synthetic Dreads 1.1 Dread Extensions 1.2 Dread Falls 1.3 Dread Styles Categories of Synthetic Dreads[edit] Dread Extensions[edit] Dread extensions can be braided, sewn, or wrapped into natural hair. With proper maintenance extensions can last up to four months, sometimes longer depending on how fast the hair grows and creates looseness at the scalp. Dread extensions come in single and double ended. Single ended means the synthetic hair is created with the loop on the top so that natural hair can slide through and then be braided or wrapped onto the dread, then tied off with a rubber band or thread. Double ended is twice the length of a single and folded in half to create the look of "two dreads in one." Only one half of the dread is braided or wrapped into the hair while the other half hangs loose, giving a more realistic appearance because there is no braid at the top on half of the set. Dread Falls[edit] Dread Falls are single ended dreads looped onto a piece of lace or elastic. Falls are attached by pony tail or pigtail and range from short to long, and they are easily customizable. They are worn and removed with no damage or strain on natural hair. Many other materials can be used in either dreads or extensions such as tubed crin (cyberlocks), beads, yarn, fiber optic string lights, flat plastic in neon colors, etc. Some sets can be made entirely from wool. Wool dreads give a similar look to real dreads and are very soft. Wool can range in many colors that cannot be recreated in synthetic hair, and therefore they give a certain appeal to cybergoths who tend to coordinate with a variety of colors. Dread Styles[edit] There are many different styles of dreads. Solid Coloured Dreads are made from a single coloured fibre. Candycane Dreads are made using two or more colours twisted together to give a candycane effect. Blended Dreads are made from a blend of different colours to create a more subtle tone. Transitional Dreads start in one colour and end with the tip being another colour. Natural Style Dreads are made from the same synthetic materials but resemble natural dreadlocks.

From Dartmouth he entered Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1836. That year he moved to Detroit and formed a law firm with George F. Porter. Railroad magnate[edit] In 1846 he entered the railroad business as the lawyer and general counsel to the Michigan Central Railroad. He was subsequently connected with the Illinois Central Railroad. Joy organized the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and was for many years its president. Joy was for several years president of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway. In 1872 he was president and a director of the Michigan Central Railroad, drawing a salary of $8,000 per year.[1] He was at the same time president and a director of the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad, and a director of the Detroit, Hillsdale and Indiana Railroad.[2] In 1873 he became president and a director of the Detroit, Lansing and Lake Michigan Railroad, taking over from H.H. Smith. He became president and treasurer of the Detroit Union Railway Depot and Station company at Detroit, Michigan. Politics[edit] Joy was intimately involved with politics from his early career. A member of the Whig Party and subsequently a Republican, for a time he had also been a member of the Free Soil Party. He was a close friend, confidant and supporter of Abraham Lincoln. At the 1880 Republican National Convention, he gave a speech nominating James G. Blaine for president. He was a representative in the Michigan Legislature in 1861 and was later elected a Regent of the University of Michigan, serving from 1882 to 1886, when he resigned the office.[3] Notes[edit] ^ First Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1873 ^ First Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1873 ^ Hinsdale, B.A. (1906).

Critics have called it Buchan's masterpiece. Contents 1 Plot 2 Background 3 Critical reception 4 Adaptations 5 References 6 External links Plot[edit] In a prologue to the novel, the narrator recalls legends of the time, 300 years ago, when the minister of the Kirk of Woodilee in the Scottish lowlands was spirited away by the fairies or – as some said – by the devil. The story opens in 1644 with the coming of David Sempill, newly-ordained minister of the Church of Scotland, to Woodilee, a parish passionate in its support of the Covenant. Sempill is less committed to strict doctrinal practices than many of the Covenanters, and he finds himself attracted to the creed of Mark Kerr, a fugitive and follower of Lord Montrose, supporter of the King and enemy of the Kirk. Soon afterwards, when Kerr is injured, the minister secretes him within the manse. One night in the feared Black Wood of Melanudrigill the minister stumbles across a diabolic rite in which figures wearing animal headpieces dance around a pagan altar. He later attempts to identify the ringleader and although unsuccessful manages to splash his clothes with pungent aniseed oil. The next day the wife of a prominent elder of the Kirk, Ephraim Caird, is discovered burning clothes on a fire which smells strongly of aniseed. The plague comes to Woodilee. Sempill labours to prevent its spread helped by a newcomer named Mark Riddel who, unknown to the locals, is in fact the fugitive Mark Kerr. Nursing care is surreptitiously provided by a shadowy figure whom the locals take to be a fairy but who is in fact Katrine Yester, niece of the local laird, to whom Sempill is secretly engaged. Katrine contracts the plague and dies. A local woman is accused by a pricker of being a witch and in spite of the best efforts of Sempill and Riddel is tortured and killed. Sempill presents his evidence of Ephraim Caird's heresy to the presbytery, the Kirk's religious court, which rejects it as circumstantial and unreliable. In retaliation, Caird brings counter-charges against the minister for harbouring a fugitive, for associating with Mark Riddel (now publicly identified as Mark Kerr), and for keeping the company of an unknown woman. Sempill is found guilty and is excommunicated and ejected from his ministry. On his way back from the hearing, Sempill meets Ephraim Caird near the Black Wood. He forces Caird to enter, kneel before the pagan altar, and to make his choice between Christ and the devil. The effort is too much for Caird who runs off in demented terror and is killed in a fall. The minister is never after that day seen again, giving rise to the legends mentioned in the novel's prologue. In an epilogue, it is revealed that Sempill and Kerr had ridden to Leith and had boarded the first available ship out of Scotland. Background[edit] Witch Wood was written while Buchan was researching Montrose, the revised version of his biography of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, who appears as a minor character in the novel. His research had raised questions of religious tolerance which he wanted to explore. The story was originally known as The Minister of Woodilee and was first serialised in British Weekly under the title The High Places.[2] According to the historian Ronald Hutton, it was based upon the Witch-cult hypothesis of the anthropologist Margaret Murray.[3] Critical reception[edit] Early critics were quick to recognise the significance of the novel, which has since come to be regarded as Buchan's masterpiece.[4] The Spectator called it "this powerful, charming and spiritually earnest novel which almost enables Mr Buchan to be called a modern and terse Walter Scott",[4] and the Glasgow Herald thought that it "must be adjudged the greatest of Mr Buchan's published works. That it concerns the land and history of Scotland, that it makes brilliant use of braid Scots dialect and that it enshrines many aspects, both admirable and contemptible, of the Scottish character are features that must give satisfaction to Mr Buchan's countrymen".[4] Of the Buchan novels, Witch Wood was the author's own favourite[5][6] and has been described as "a masterful tale of godliness in conflict with wickedness."[7] C. S. Lewis wrote, "for Witch Wood specially I am always grateful; all that devilment sprouting up out of a beginning like Galt’s Annals of the Parish. That's the way to do it".[8] In The Interpreter's House (1975), David Daniell notes that Witch Wood is tightly enclosed, with everything taking place under a heavy, black, suffocating pall of evil. Buchan's writing, Daniell says, "catches the obscene out of the tail of the eye, where it is most effective"; "Projecting his own favourite Scottish place, Broughton, back three centuries when the whole area was under forest, and doing it so convincingly, is a considerable feat. Doing it with such economic realism and keeping up a multiple pressure of plot makes it extraordinary". But Daniell's highest praise is reserved for the way Buchan presents "the ordinary people of the parish, the farmers who so represent the land that they are known by the names of their farms, the few cottagers, the herds and the elders and the children".[9] Adaptations[edit] The novel was adapted for television twice by the BBC, first for Sunday Night Theatre in 1954, with Tom Fleming as Sempill,[10] then in 1964 as a four-episode series, with Donald Douglas in the role.[11][12] References[edit] ^ a b c "British Library Item details". primocat.bl.uk.

Lewis Building is a historic building in the Barelas neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties[2] and the National Register of Historic Places.[1] It was built around 1882 by Charles W. Lewis (1844–1901), a native of Peralta, New Mexico who came to Albuquerque in 1873. Lewis was one of many Albuquerque residents to get involved in land speculation as the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway approached the town in the late 1870s. Once the railroad arrived, Lewis was able to subdivide a valuable piece of land near the tracks and used one of the lots for the building described here, which was probably built as rental housing.[3] In 1915 it was reportedly being operated as a saloon.[4] The building is a one-story, rectangular brick structure with a hipped roof supported by distinctive triangular brick corbels that wrap around all four sides. Originally front of the building had two doors and two sash windows; a third door was added later and the original transoms and window arches have been stuccoed over. The interior of the building has four rooms arranged in a linear plan, with a later addition at the rear.[3] References[edit] ^ a b "National Register Information System".

Edward Tryon, in the audience, was seized by an idea and blurted "Maybe the universe is a vacuum fluctuation." This was treated as a joke at the time, but Tryon had not been joking. In a 1984 interview, Tryon recalled that three years later, sitting at home, he had a further revelation; "I visualized the universe erupting out of nothing as a quantum fluctuation and I realized that it was possible that it explained the critical density of the universe."[2] The critical density of the universe is dependent upon the rate at which the universe is still expanding. The universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, but was originally thought to be slowing down. Furthermore, the rate at which this is changing gives the overall mass density of the universe which is denoted by the Greek letter omega. If omega is less than one, the mass density would be insufficient to stop the universe's expansion and it would go on expanding forever. If omega is more than one, the universe will eventually stop expanding and will thus collapse in on itself to again form another fireball not unlike the one from which it came. If omega is exactly 1, the universe's expansion will continuously slow, but never quite halt. Tryon's theory requires that omega be equal to or less than one. Through calculations it has been found that omega is 1 as far as instruments are able to determine. However, the universe could be so vast that its curvature is undetectable. The universe's rate of expansion is accelerating and is projected to continue accelerating due to dark energy, thus omega must be lower than 1. The concept of vacuum genesis was further promoted by Lawrence M. Krauss in his book A Universe from Nothing, published in 2012. The book contents was deemed to be "not supported by modern general relativity theory or quantum field theory" in critical paper in 2015.[3] See also[edit] Zero-energy universe Chaotic Inflation theory False vacuum References[edit] ^ Tryon, Edward P.

The same year would spawn another chart topper with "We R Who We R". The Billboard Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by Billboard magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, and airplay. There were 17 total number-one singles in 2010. In 2010, nine acts gained their first U.S. number-one single either as a lead or featured act: Kesha, Taio Cruz, B.o.B, Bruno Mars, will.i.am, Far East Movement, The Cataracs, Dev, and Drake.[1][2][3][4][5] Rihanna earned four number-one singles during the year — three as a solo artist and one as featured guest on Eminem's "Love the Way You Lie" — the first time a female artist has achieved this accomplishment in a single calendar year. She also became the female artist with the fifth most number-one singles, scoring her sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth number-one singles during the year.[6] Katy Perry, Eminem, Kesha, and Bruno Mars also each scored multiple number-one singles during the year, with Katy Perry scoring three consecutive number-one singles — a feat last done by R&B singer Monica eleven years earlier.[7][8][9][10] Usher became the first artist to score number-one singles in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s when his song "OMG" reached number one, becoming his ninth number-one single.[11] Kesha's "Tik Tok" was the longest-running number-one single of the year with nine consecutive weeks at the top — the longest run for a debut single by a female artist since 1977.[12] Two singles debuted at the top of the chart this year: Eminem's "Not Afraid" and Kesha's "We R Who We R," becoming the sixteenth and seventeenth singles in the chart's 52-year history to debut at number one.[13][14] Contents 1 Chart history 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Chart history Rapper Eminem's lead-off single (from his album Recovery) "Not Afraid" became the first hip-hop song to debut at the top of the charts since Puff Daddy's "I'll Be Missing You" in 1997, the sixteenth overall in the chart's 52-year history. The same album would spawn another chart topper in 2010 with "Love The Way You Lie" (featuring Rihanna). Rihanna became the first female artist in the history of the chart to have four number-one singles in a calendar year. She also became the first artist to have a lead single from an album reach number one after its second single when her "Only Girl (In the World)" reached the top of the chart two weeks after "What's My Name?" did. Katy Perry became the first female artist in eleven years to have three #1 singles from an album. She would go on to have five consecutive and six non-consecutive #1 singles from that album. Usher became the first artist to score number-one singles in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s when "OMG" reached #1.

Biography[edit] He was the third son of Duke Otto I of Carinthia (d. 1004),[1] who at the time of his birth ruled the Wormsgau in Rhenish Franconia. Conrad thereby was the younger brother of Count Henry of Speyer (d. about 990), the father of the first Salian emperor Conrad II, and brother of Bruno (d. 999), who prepared for an ecclesiastical career and became the first German Pope as Gregory V in 996. His Salian grandfather Conrad the Red had been a loyal supporter of King Otto I of Germany and in turn was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Lotharingia (Lorraine) in 944. He built close relations with the ruling Ottonian dynasty by marrying the king's daughter Liutgarde in 947. However, in 953 he was deposed upon his involvement in an unsuccessful rebellion by Otto's son Duke Liudolf of Swabia against his uncle Duke Henry I of Bavaria. Conrad's father Otto of Worms ruled over several Frankish Gaue, he was first vested with the Duchy of Carinthia in 978 by Emperor Otto II after the deposition of the Luitpolding duke Henry the Younger in the War of the Three Henries. Otto of Worms remained a supporter of the Ottonian dynasty, even though he had to renounce the duchy, when the emperor's widow Theophanu reconciled with Henry the Younger in 985. Not until the death of the Ottonian duke Henry the Wrangler in 995, he was again vested with Carinthia and also ruled in the March of Verona. Conrad had already outlived his elder brothers, when upon the sudden death of Emperor Otto III in 1002, his father Otto of Worms was candidate in the royal German election but renounced in favour of the Ottonian duke Henry IV of Bavaria, the son of late Duke Henry the Wrangler. In that year or thereabouts, Conrad married Matilda, daughter of Henry's rival, the Conradine duke Herman II of Swabia.[2] Unlike his father, Conrad supported Herman’s bid for the German throne.[3] Finally, Henry was elected and crowned King of the Romans (as Henry II) on 7 June. Conrad and Matilda had two sons: Conrad the Younger, Duke of Carinthia from 1036[2] Bruno, Bishop of Würzburg from 1034. Conrad's marriage with Matilda was consanguineous[4] and was condemned by Henry II (her father’s rival) at the synod of Thionville (January 1003).[5] Nevertheless, the couple remained together until Conrad’s death in 1011. When Otto of Worms died in 1004, his only surviving son Conrad could succeed him as Carinthian duke and Margrave of Verona. Upon Conrad's early death, his minor son with Matilda, Conrad the Younger, was passed over in the succession for the Duchy of Carinthia. Instead King Henry II of Germany passed the duchy to Adalbert of Eppenstein, who was married to Matilda’s sister, Beatrice.[6] Conrad was buried in Worms Cathedral. His widow Matilda secondly married Duke Frederick II of Lorraine (d. 1026) and thirdly the Ascanian count Esico of Ballenstedt.

The Percy Burn Viaduct is 125 m long and 36 m high, and was specified for the transport of the 80 t Lidgerwood steam winch, which had been imported from the United States as well as the heavy load of logging trains. During its construction, Australian hard wood was used, because it has a higher strength and durability than local timber. The trusses of the Sand Hill Viaduct consisted of round hard wood trunks, which were surrounded by less durable sap wood. The other viaducts were made from sawn timber, of which the sap wood had been removed.[4] The four viaducts are the largest logging railway viaducts of New Zealand. They are listed buildings and are preserved in a structurally weak condition.[4] History[edit] Construction[edit] A section of the Port Craig tramway, which had apparently been used by horse-drawn trains The construction started in 1917. In 1921 more than 1.6 km (1 mi) long section of track has been completed,[5] and this has been extended by 1925.[6] The screws of the trestle bridges were made locally by the blacksmith of Port Craig. He forged every morning a head onto either side of a batch of 200 bolts. He made these from round bars, which had been originally twice as long. Subsequently, he heated them up again and split these into two parts with a sledge hammer and a cold chisel. The teacher of the camp's school, who was employed by the sawmilling company helped him in the afternoon after finishing his classes by cutting the thread onto the bolts. The quality was high, because every bolt which exceeded the nominal length by more than one inch (25 mm) was rejected.[3] The Sand Hill Viaduct was commissioned in 1924. The larger Percy Burn Viaduct was completed around 1925, and shortly after its erector, the Chester Construction Company went bankrupt because of the overspend. The third and fourth viaducts were probably completed by 1926 the latest. The Sand Hill, Edwin Burn and Francis Burn viaducts were built by Jim Kane, a former bridge builder of New Zealand Railways Department and a team of employees of the sawmilling company.[2] The Lidgerwood steam which became inoperable in 1926 due to a boiler failure.[2] In 1928 the company went into a financial stale mate and was wound down. It was temporarily re-activated in 1930, but at the end of the 1930s the buildings of the settlement were demolished.[7] Die Schienen wurden 1939 abgebaut.[8] Operation[edit] Steam locomotive at the sawmill The nearby bush areas on Māori land were one of the biggest assets of the location because their harvest did not require a costly government licence, and access only required negotiations with the Māori landowners. The trees on Māori land, which attracted the Marlborough Timber Company (MTC), were on Māori land as a consequence of the South Island Landless Natives Act in 1906, but Māori understood that they could not exploit them on their own. Most Māori thus agreed to the negotiations about harvesting the giant trees in 4,000 acres of bushland. Only the owners of two areas between Mussel Beach and the Wairaurahiri River objected to selling their trees to the sawmill. The forestry commission demanded that the price to be paid to the Māori owners should not be less than that of the government licences, not only to protect the rights of the Māori but also to ensure that forests requiring a government permit to harvest would not be devalued.[2] Closure[edit] The harbour and the sawmill of Port Craig, 1927 The bush land was less fruitful than expected. The American steam winch was overdimensioned for the NZ bus and shipping was more costly than expected because the new built harbour quickly silted, after the expensive breakwater had been completed, which made loading of ocean going vessels more complicated than originally envisaged. The oversaturated timber markets resulted in unattractive pricing, so that the company became unprofitable, and the investors could not be satisfied.[2] At the end of 1928 the directors of the company resigned, and the company was closed with very little advance notice to its employees. Shortly after, Sims Cooper, one of the original investors, founded a new company, Holdings Limited, to takeover the liquidated assets of MTC. Holdings Limited employed several caretakers, to protect the assets at this remote location, and took-over the log harvesting and tramway licences formerly held by Marlborough Timber Company, in the hope of revamping business and getting a return on their investments. In previous months, the MTC had obtained a new licence for harvesting the governmental forests north of the Maori land around Percy Burn Viaduct, as it became evident, that they couldn't get funding for a new bridge over the Wairaurahiri River, which would have been the only alternative, to obtain access to undepleted forest areas. Holdings Limited took over the licences for this area and maintained them from 1928 to 1941. In 1930 they briefly re-commissioned the sawmill, but the sinking timber prices due to the worldwide depression in the 1930s upset their plans. A team salvaged as much as possible in 1938 and demolished the remaining structures. Subsequently, the forestry commission objected to the last request to extend the milling licence and the licences expired.[2] Locomotives[edit] A & G Price Locomotive Ar #115 at Port Craig and after being sold Saddle tank locomotive #28 on the Percy Burn viaduct Steam locomotives were introduced in 1919.[9] The A & G Price locomotive Ar #115 was used from 1926 to 1931. It was an articulated 0-4-0+0-4-0 Meyer locomotive. It was the largest and heaviest locomotive that Price have ever built.[10] In addition a second-hand smaller saddle tank locomotive #28 was used.[3] It was a Davenport with works number 1862 of 1921. Its PWD number at the Public Works Department had been 528. It was sold to Bruce Bay Timber in 1935.[11] Walking tracks[edit] Percy Burn Viaduct Parts of the right-of-way of the former tramline were made accessible again in 2009 as the Hump Ridge Track and South Coast Track. The former school has been converted to an overnight shelter at the same time.[2] References[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Port Craig tramway.

In particular, the band's use of clean vocals was viewed negatively by HM Magazine writer Matt Morrow, who suggested that the band should have stuck to a solely black metal vocal style.[1] Morrow also leveled heavy criticism at the song "A Stranger So Close".[1] However, some parts of Kekal's material received praise. The song "Mean Attraction" from the band’s previous release, The Painful Experience was called a "hit,"[4] and Morrow said that as that song was the best on The Painful Experience, he did not mind it on this release.[1] Morrow also expressed admiration over Kekal's "emotional" and "passionate" cover of the Trouble song "The Skull".[1] Overall, Morrow stated that Kekal was very talented, but held back somewhat by its experimentation.[1] Michiel de Rooij of Lords of Metal praised the tracks "The Only Sound of Rain" and "A Stranger So Close", but found "Mean Attraction" boring and hated the band's cover of "The Skull", as he already disliked Trouble and though the song was performed by a different band he could still not appreciate it.[5] Slechtvalk's performance was highly praised by Morrow, who stated that he was anticipating the release of the album because of this band's appearance. He did direct some criticism at the first song, "Whispers in the Dark", for using a drum machine, but said that the following three songs, with real drumming, left him speechless.[1] Morrow noted the band’s cover of "Kongsblood", which was originally by Antestor, stating that Slechtvalk did a great job, but that he liked atmosphere of the original version by Antestor better.[1] de Rooij he praised the song "Whispers in the Dark", but found that "The Dragon's Children" and "Storms" were not of the same quality.[5] "Storms" in particular he considered rushed and unoriginal, though not a bad song.[5] "Kongsblood" he lavished with praise, considering it the best on the entire split and writing "I've just listened to it tree [sic] times to obtain a good impression…. and I think I'm going to listen to it once more."[5] In an interview with Art for the Ears, Slechtvalk founder Shamgar said that while he liked his song "Storms" from the release, he prefers the material found on The War That Plagues the Lands, Slechtvalk's follow-up album.[6] Overall, Matt Morrow gave the album nine out of ten possible points. Michiel de Rooij rated the split sixty-three out of one hundred.[5] Promonex, a staff reviewer from Metal Storm, graded the entire album eight out of ten points.[2] Stylistically, Slechtvalk played black metal for most of the album, with "The Dragon's Children" described as a "brutal, pure black metal song" without any keyboards, while the song "Storms" delved into a symphonic black metal style using extremely fast blasting and a mixture of black and death metal vocals.[1] Track listing[edit] KekalNo.TitleOriginal artistLength1."The Only Sound of Rain" 6:132."Mean Attraction" 4:123."A Stranger So Close" 5:324."The Skull"Trouble5:54 SlechtvalkNo.TitleOriginal artistLength5."Whispers in the Dark" 4:246."The Dragon's Children" 3:317."Storms" 4:028."Kongsblod"Antestor5:53[7] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k Morrow, Matt.

Prominent examples of such armour are lorica segmentata of Ancient Rome[2] and certain versions of samurai armour. Less known examples were present in Asia from Iran to Mongolia, including Central Asia. Laminar armor from animal skins has also been traditionally made and worn in the Arctic areas of what are now Siberia, Alaska and Canada. In the 16th century laminar and lamellar armour was superseded by plated mail in the Middle East and Central Asia, remaining mainly in Mongolia. However, laminar armor did appear briefly in some form in Europe during the 16th to the 17th century with the main feature that distinguished it from other forms of laminar armor being the metal strips being fastened using sliding rivets. This was known as anima and was invented in Italy. Notable examples include the Earl of Pembroke's Armour and the armor worn by the Polish hussars. The technique was also used create segmented armor to protect the neck, upper limbs, and hips as seen in the Almain rivet, the zischagge, falling buffe, and faulds.

(July 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Laminar cuirasses were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century.[3]Tankō (laminar), worn by foot soldiers and keikō (lamellar), worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates connected by leather thongs. Kiritsuke iyozane dō (laminar cuirass), constructed with horizontal rows (bands) of armor plates laced together in a manner that simulates the scales (kozane) of lamellar armor. Okegawa dō constructed with horizontal rows (bands) of iron plates riveted together with no lacing being used at all, this type of armour was the beginning of plate armour development in Japanese armour. At the beginning of the Sengoku period Japanese armour typically had two versions – expensive and inexpensive. The difference was that expensive versions were made from hundreds or even thousands of individual leather and or iron scales laced together into armor strips (lamellar), this was a very time-consuming process.[4] The two most common types of scales which made up the Japanese lamellar armors were hon kozane which were constructed from narrow or small scales, and hon iyozane which were constructed from wider scales. Laminar armor proved to be inexpensive and easier to construct, although was often made to look like simulated lamellar plates. This is known as Kiritsuke iyozane. Kiritsuke iyozane is a form of laminar armor constructed from long strips of leather and or iron which were perforated, laced, and notched and made to replicate the look of real lamellar plates. These strips of simulated lamellar plates were much more rigid than real lamellar and they were assembled into armor items in the same way that the rows of lamellar armour were. After about a century of the ceaseless civil war during the Sengoku period simulated lamellar plates and true lamellar plates become less popular as plate armor started to be used more frequently. The laminar cuirass evolved to become the okegawa dō, constructed of horizontal strips of armour joined not by laces, but by rivets or staples (imitating laces). Middle East and Central Asian laminar armour[edit] Middle East and Central Asian laminar armour According to Bobrov, until the end of the 15th century the most popular armour in certain regions including Central Asia and Iran was lamellar armour, brigandines, and laminar armour. However, in Iran since the 15th century lamellar and laminar armour were typical only in the south, while during the 15th century the typical armour in the north was plated mail. Initially for centuries laminar armour was just a less expensive version of lamellar armor. Laminar was just made from horizontal strips of armour laced like strips of lamellar plates, but without extra-lacing and notches imitating strips of lamellar armour. And like in lamellar armour these laces could be occasionally cut during battle; the laces also frayed when an armour was worn for long periods without being mended. Later at the beginning of the 15th century construction of laminar armour had significantly changed; instead of lacing being used, strips of new laminar armour were riveted to broad straps (like in lorica segmentata). As a result, laminar armour became more reliable than lamellar armour: hidden straps couldn't be cut without the armour being penetrated, the brad straps did not require continuous mending, and the straps were stiffer and more durable than the thinner lacing that was used previously. Laminar armour eventually became more popular than lamellar armour, and almost fully replaced lamellar armour by the end of 15th century. Pure lamellar armour became very rare; however, different combinations of laminar and lamellar armour were very popular. This happened because even though laminar armour was much more reliable than lamellar, laminar armour was not flexible enough, while lamellar armours were very flexible. Laminar cuirasses could be worn with lamellar pauldrons and tassets (worn with separate bracers, greaves and helm). Less common was the opposite combination of lamellar cuirass worn with laminar pauldrons and tassets. Both could be optionally worn with lamellar or laminar cod-piece and loin-guard, or even with mirror plate reinforcement. At the end of 15th century, when laminar armour became much more popular than lamellar ones, both armour types began to be replaced by plated mails. Initially plated mail was made only as cuisses, but soon by the beginning of 16th century plated mail was utilized in both pauldrons and cuisses, as they could better envelop body and fully replaced laminar and lamellar pauldron and tassets. So a typical laminar armour of that period was just a laminar cuirass which could be worn over brigandine with sleeves supplemented by plated mail cuisses. (Helm, bracers and greaves are not mentioned here as they were conventional for that region). Sleeves of brigandine worked as pauldron, and if a brigandine was long enough its laps could work as tassets. Another option was wearing a laminar cuirass without any brigandine, but with plated mail pauldrons and cuisses. Both variations of laminar armour could be re-enforced by mirror plate (even though laminar armour would have been enough protection from steel weapons, a metal mirror was worn as protection from the "evil eye"). Finally by the end of the 16th century laminar and lamellar armour practically disappeared in the Middle East and Central Asia regions.

Both Chukchi and Yupik armour could have lamellar or laminar constructions unlike other regions were lamellar and laminar armour typically had different construction and were made from different materials. Similar lamellar armour with "wing" pauldrons was used by Koryak people. Classic lamellar armour was made from hard materials (initially from natural materials like bone, tusk, baleen, and even wood as arrow-heads initially were from bone or stone) and in the shape of a short cuirass or even consisted only of a breast-plate. While laminar armour was made from hardened seal leather and often knee long, or even longer. However late lamellar armour made from metal (iron or steel or even brass) and could be as long as laminar armour. Both lamellar and laminar armour usually were worn with a high collar (protecting neck and head) integral with one or two laminar pauldrons (used rather as shield than ordinary pauldron). This collar and its pauldrons usually were made from leather and wood. Usually at least one part of an armour (a pauldron) was laminar, but sometimes a pauldron was comparatively "short" and instead of being laminar constructed from a few wooden planks it instead used only one big plank, and the rest of the hand was protected by splinted or lamellar vambrace. Besides optional vambraces an armour could optionally have a lamellar helm, and splinted or lamellar greaves.

Chaloner Chute Chaloner Chute (died 14 April 1659) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1654 and 1659. He was Speaker briefly in 1659. Chute was the son of Chaloner Chute of the Middle Temple. He was admitted to Middle Temple and was called to the bar. He developed a great reputation at the bar and was defence lawyer in several high-profile cases including Sir Edward Herbert (the king's attorney-general), Archbishop Laud, the eleven members of the House of Commons charged by Fairfax and his army as delinquents, and James Duke of Hamilton.[1] In 1653 he bought The Vyne, the Tudor palace which is located near Sherborne St John on the outskirts of Basingstoke in Hampshire. He demolished much of the northern part of the decaying building and employed the architect John Webb, a pupil of Inigo Jones, to add the portico to the north front in the 1650s, the first of its kind on an English country house. The Vyne Memorial to Chaloner Chute in the chapel of The Vyne in Hampshire Chute was elected Member of Parliament for Middlesex in the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656 (but was prevented from taking his seat). He was elected MP for Middlesex again to the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659 and became its first Speaker.[2] However he had to stand down because of ill health and died in April. Chute married Anne Place, widow of William Place of Dorking, Surrey and daughter of Sir John Scory of Wormesley, Herefordshire. He was succeeded by his only surviving son Chaloner.[3] See also[edit] Charles Herbert Cottrell (a descendant) References[edit] ^ "biography". Archived from the original on 23 May 2009.

Work to define T-MPLS was started by the ITU-T in February 2006. It was intended specifically as a connection-oriented packet-switched (co-ps) application offering a simpler implementation by removing MPLS features that are not relevant to co-ps applications and adding mechanisms that provide support of critical transport functionality. ITU-T ceased work on T-MPLS in December 2008, in favour of MPLS-TP standardization.[1] T-MPLS uses the same architectural principles of layered networking that are used in other technologies like SDH and OTN. Service providers have already developed management processes and work procedures based on these principles for use in networks that use those other technologies. In this way T-MPLS was intended to provide a reliable packet-based technology that is familiar and also aligned with circuit-based transport networking; it supports current organizational processes and large-scale work procedures. T-MPLS is a low cost Layer 2 technology that provides QoS, end-to-end OA&M and protection switching. The following ITU-T Recommendations exist for T-MPLS. These Recommendations will be superseded (i.e., replaced) by new revisions that apply to MPLS-TP and reference the joint work being undertaken by the ITU-T and IETF. Recommendation Title G.8110.1[2] Architecture of Transport MPLS (T-MPLS) Layer Network G.8112[3] Interfaces for the Transport MPLS (T-MPLS) Hierarchy G.8121[4] Characteristics of Transport MPLS equipment functional blocks G.8131[5] Linear protection switching for Transport MPLS (T-MPLS) networks Y.Sup4[6] ex G.8113 (draft) Requirements for OAM function in T-MPLS based networks A further set of ITU-T Recommendations were at a draft stage when work on T-MPLS was halted. These may be resumed at a later stage to reference the material developed as part of the MPLS-TP effort. Draft Recommendation Title G.8114 (draft) Operation & Maintenance mechanisms for T-MPLS layer networks G.8132 (draft) Shared Protection Ring switching for T-MPLS networks After IETF raised concerns over T-MPLS technology, mainly about incompatibility with the already established IP/MPLS, the ITU-T and the IETF started a joint activity to solve potential issues. The decision was to transfer control to IETF to develop a new MPLS profile specialized for transport (MPLS-TP) with input from ITU recommendations[7] A new activity was added to the charter of the MPLS working group of IETF.

(August 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Australian former safecracker Red is released from prison after two years, Red reconnects with his wife Chloe (Nina Dobrev), their daughter "Bea" Beatrice (who now only speaks in her mother's native French after learning it from her Mexican nanny Lolita) and his former colleague Le Roi, who has been holding $500,000 in untraceable bearer bonds for him from their last heist in his pawn shop's hidden basement; Red's parole officer DPO Ernesto Sanchez (Clifton Collins Jr.) remains suspicious of him and Le Roi. In Le Roi's basement, Red attempts to crack his safe, an identical one to the one from the bank he had robbed but finds he is no longer able to do so due to a lack of practice. Meanwhile, psychopathic contract killer Luc, recently taken off of the no-fly list, enters the country searching for Red, leaving the airport by killing a man and taking his car. While acquiring weaponry from an associate of his, Jean-Jacques, at his bar, having sex with Jean-Jacques girlfriend as "payment" for the weaponry, Jean-Jacques explains to his friends that Luc is in charge of "retirement" for "the Commission" and that they should be as terrified of him as he himself is, begging his cockiest friend not to insult Luc or try to kill him. After Luc returns without Jean-Jacques girlfriend and the cockiest friend inquires about her, Luc claims off-hand to have killed her after the act to prevent there being any small talk, which Jean-Jacques accepts, only for Jean-Jacques friend to insult him. Luc then shoots Jean-Jacques friend and asks the other whether he was aware that Jean-Jacques has been embezzling from the Commission. After the friend responds that Jean-Jacques has, Jean-Jacques goes for his shotgun to shoot Luc only for Luc to shoot him, inadvertently setting off Jean-Jacques gun and killing the other friend. As he makes his way through town, Luc shoots the owner of a lowrider and joyrides it around town, before killing two police officers after they attempt to stop him. At the art gallery at which she is preparing to have an exhibition of her paintings that night, Chloe's boss Derrek Blarney attempts to proposition her, only for her to reveal that Red has been released from prison. Outraged at the rejection, Derrek threatens to take back the loan Chloe has been living off of since Red's incarceration if she does not sell any paintings that night. That night, Red and Le Roi attend Chloe's exhibition; Le Roi restrains Red from insulting the critics who are insulting his wife's character. Red questions Chloe about Ernesto Sanchez' presence at the exhibition, revealing that he is an avid art collector and is genuinely interested in the art. Elsewhere, Luc arrives at Red's house looking for him, killing Lolita as Bea flees, before discovering the location of the exhibition from a card left on Chloe's table. As Derrek attempts to again seduce Chloe, Bea arrives looking for her; Red spots Luc arriving and shouts a warning to her, allowing Chloe and Bea to flee as Luc shoots in Red's direction, mortally wounding Le Roi, who gives Red the key to his safe. Ernesto Sanchez then shoots at Luc, who in response ends up killing almost all of the critics present at the exhibition, before leaving to pursue Red. After Luc climbs atop Red's car in an attempt to kill him, Red shoots Luc's gun at the ceiling of the car, knocking him off of it. After Chloe questions him on Luc's presence, Red reveals Luc is the brother of his partner in the bank heist who was shot by police, and that he would likely be looking for the bearer bonds Red had pretended were destroyed, which in fact he had had Le Roi smuggle out of the bank via tunnels leading to his basement. They decide to proceed to Le Roi's basement to retrieve the money. As Red enters the basement, Luc catches up with the car on-foot, holding Chloe hostage as Bea runs inside towards her father. After Red offers Luc the bonds and himself in exchange for his family's lives, Luc reveals that he was unaware of the bonds' existence and merely blames Red for living in his brother's place, considering them a nice surprise for after he kills him and his family. Red moves in front of her as Luc fires, unintentionally knocking her into the safe. Luc overlooks the short-breathed Red and locks the safe, informing him that he will hear her suffocating before he dies from the gunshot. Luc then pursues Chloe as she flees into the tunnels connected to Le Roi's basement; Chloe manages to impale him in the back with a rake, before fleeing back to the basement and up into Le Roi's shop. Meanwhile, Red is revealed to have been alive, Luc's bullet having been blocked by Le Roi's key to the safe (which he had left in his breast pocket), which has been rendered unusable. As Red tells Bea through the sage to conserve her breaths, Luc returns and holds him at gunpoint. As he prepares to shoot him, Ernesto Sanchez arrives, having been retrieved by Chloe, and orders Luc to drop his weapon. After Luc instead tries to kill him, Ernesto Sanchez shoots him several times. Recognizing himself to be beaten, Luc sets off a pair of charged explosives that disintegrate himself and the bearer bonds. As Red tries to open the safe, Ernesto Sanchez tries to arrest him for breaking his parole, only to allow him to try to crack the safe upon learning Bea is inside. Although nervous, Red manages to free Bea, and the family hug. Looking at the happy family, Ernesto Sanchez decides not to arrest Red, and remarks at his dissatisfaction at how the evening has unfolded, and that he likely will receive commendation for having stopped Luc. Several days later, while Bea pays her respect to Lolita's ashes and Chloe remarks that their water is about to be shut off, Red offers to move the family back to Chloe's native France despite himself not speaking French once his parole is over. Suddenly, an excited Derrek arrives at the house to reveal that Chloe's paintings have sold out for hundreds of thousands due to them having been spattered with "the blood of her critics" during Luc's shootout at the art gallery, before giving her cut of the proceedings and asking when her next art show will be. As the family closes the door in Derrek's face, Bea speaks English for the first time to declare to the audience that it is "The End", before the family dances happily together at their newfound wealth.

A ballonet is an air bag inside the outer envelope of an airship which, when inflated, reduces the volume available for the lifting gas, making it more dense. Because air is also denser than the lifting gas, inflating the ballonet reduces the overall lift, while deflating it increases lift. In this way, the ballonet can be used to adjust the lift as required. Ballonets may typically be used in non-rigid or semi-rigid airships, commonly with multiple ballonets located both fore and aft to maintain balance and to control the pitch of the airship. The image illustrates the principle of a balloon within a balloon. The outer balloon represents the airship's outer envelope or gasbag, while the red inner balloon represents the ballonet. In an airship the ballonet would be much smaller relative to the size of the gasbag; for example, in the French airship Lebaudy Patrie the volume of the ballonet was approximately one-fifth that of the envelope. History[edit] La France, the first successful airship The ballonet was first described in 1783 by Jean Baptiste Meusnier, then a lieutenant in the French Army. However his own airship project was unsuccessful. In 1784 professor Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers built an elongated, steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals. Their design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cell), a rudder, and oars for propulsion, which proved useless.[1] On July 15 the brothers flew it for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon accompanied by M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres. The absence of a lifting gas release valve meant that the Duke had to slash the envelope to prevent it rupturing when they reached an altitude of about 4,500 metres (15,000 ft).[2][3] It was not until after Meusnier's death that the first successful application took flight. On 8 August 1884 the first practical airship, La France, flew for the first time.[4] Ballonet air valves were originally of a butterfly type, actuated by springs. If pressure rose in the ballonet, a spring would pressure the spindle of the butterfly valve to turn, relieving the pressure. In more recent implementations, the valves are actuated electrically either by a linear actuator (driven open/closed) or a linear solenoid (spring return), the latter being the favored fail-to-safe arrangement.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ Lance Day; Ian McNeil (2003).

Originally built in the 12th century in the Romanesque style, the building has been the property of the Reformed Church in Slovakia since 1655. Renovations[edit] After a fire damaged the building, the chapel was rebuilt between 1833 and 1835, with further renovations in 1932 and from 1957 to 1958. The 1833 fire revealed some frescoes depicting celestial bodies and animals. Structure[edit] The church is built from hewn stones and strengthened with stooks. The typical Romanesque semicircular apse is vaulted by concha. The apse is continued by aisle. The Romanesque windows survived the fire. In 1932 the Romanesque portal was revealed on the south frontlet. The Classicist organ dates from 1833. Originally the church was enclosed within a fortress wall of which only a slightly rising entrenchment remained. References[edit] This article does not cite any sources.

P. Hay, 1929 Suborder: Lepisosteoidei Superfamily: Lepisosteoidea Family: LepisosteidaeG. Cuvier, 1825 Genera †Nhanulepisosteus [1] †Masillosteus [it] [1] †Cuneatus Atractosteus Lepisosteus Gars are members of the Lepisosteiformes (or Semionotiformes), an ancient holosteian order of ray-finned fish; fossils from this order are known from the Late Jurassic onwards. The family Lepisosteidae includes seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine, waters of eastern North America, Central America and the Caribbean islands.[2][3] Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with ganoid scales,[4] and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Gars are sometimes referred to as "garpike", but are not closely related to pike, which are in the fish family Esocidae. All of the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) is the largest – the alligator gar often grows to a length of over 2 m (6.5 ft) and a weight of over 45 kg (100 lb),[5] and specimens of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in length have been reported.[6] Unusually, their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs,[7] and most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans, but gar eggs are highly toxic.

The genus name Lepisosteus comes from the Greek lepis meaning "scale" and osteon meaning "bone".[10] Atractosteus is similarly derived from Greek, in this case from atraktos, meaning arrow.[11] Distribution[edit] Fossilized gars have been found in Europe, India, South America, and North America, indicating that in times past, these fish had a wider distribution than they do today. Gars are considered to be a remnant of a group of bony fish that flourished in the Mesozoic, and are most closely related to the bowfin. The distribution of the gar Lepisosteidae in North America lies mainly in the shallow, brackish waters off of Texas, Louisiana, and the eastern coast of Mexico, as well as in some of the rivers and lakes that flow to them.[12][13] A few populations are also present in the Great Lakes region of the United States, living in similar shallow waters.[14] Anatomy[edit] Large gar in an aquarium Scales[edit] Atractosteus fossil Gar bodies are elongated, heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Their tails are heterocercal, and the dorsal fins are close to the tail.[15] Swim bladder[edit] As their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs,[7] most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air, doing so more frequently in stagnant or warm water when the concentration of oxygen in the water is low. Experiments on the swim bladder has shown that the temperature of the water affects which respiration method the gar will use: aerial or aquatic. They will increase the aerial breathing rate (breathing air) as temperature of the water is increased. Gars can live completely submerged in oxygenated water without access to air and remain healthy while also being able to survive in deoxygenated water if allowed access to air.[16] This adaptation can be the result of environmental pressures and behavioral factors.[17] As a result of this organ, they are extremely resilient and able to tolerate conditions that most other fish could not survive. Pectoral girdle[edit] Medial and lateral view of Lepisosteidae pectoral girdle The gar has paired pectoral fins and pelvic fins, as well as an anal fin, a caudal fin, and a dorsal fin.[18] The bone structures within the fins are important to study as they can show homology throughout the fossil record. Specifically, the pelvic girdle resembles that of other actinopterygians while still having some of its own characteristics. Gars have a postcleithrun - which is a bone that is lateral to the scapula, but do not have postpectorals. Proximally to the postcleithrum, the supracleithrum is important as it plays a critical role in opening the gar's jaws. This structure has a unique internal coracoid lamina only present in the Gar species. Near the supracleithrum is the posttemporal bone, which is significantly smaller than other actinopterygians. Gars also have no clavicle bone, although there have been observations of elongated plates within the area.[19] Morphology[edit] Fin chart for shortnose gar All the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar Atractosteus spatula is the largest. The largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was 8 ft 5 1⁄4 in (2.572 m) long, weighed 327 lb (148 kg), and was 47 in (120 cm) around the girth.[20] Even the smaller species, such as Lepisosteus oculatus, are large, commonly reaching lengths of over 60 cm (2.0 ft), and sometimes much longer.[21] Ecology[edit] A range map of Lepisosteiformes. Gars tend to be slow-moving fish except when striking at their prey. They prefer the shallow and weedy areas of rivers, lakes, and bayous, often congregating in small groups.[2] They are voracious predators, catching their prey in their needle-like teeth with a sideways strike of the head.[21] They feed extensively on smaller fish and invertebrates such as crabs.[6] Gars are found across much of the eastern portion of North America.[2] Although gars are found primarily in freshwater habitats, several species enter brackish waters and a few, most notably Atractosteus tristoechus, are sometimes found in the sea. Some gars travel from lakes and rivers through sewers to get to ponds.[2][22] Species and Identification[edit] The gar family contains seven extant species, in two genera:[7] Cladogram of living gars[23] Lepisosteidae Atractosteus A. tropicus A. tristoechus A. spatula Lepisosteus L. oculatus L. platyrhincus L. osseus L. platostomus Family Lepisosteidae Genus Atractosteus Rafinesque, 1820 †Atractosteus africanus (Arambourg & Joleaud, 1943) [24] Atractosteus spatula (Lacépède, 1803) (alligator gar) Atractosteus tristoechus (Bloch & J.

Some states also impose a minimum length requirement to prevent gar from being caught at too early an age.[31] Scientists have found that the alligator gar can help maintain ecosystem balance by eating invasive species such as the Asian carp, and their success in a particular area can show scientists that area may also make a suitable habitat for other migratory species.[32] Florida gar[edit] Main article: Florida gar Lepisosteus platyrhincus The Florida gar (Lepisosteus platyrhincus) can be found in the Ocklockonee river, Florida, and Georgia,[33][34] and prefers muddy or sandy bottoms with bountiful vegetation.[33][35] It is commonly confused with its cousin, the spotted gar.[33] Uneven black spots cover its head, body, and fins.[33][34] Green-brown scales run along the back of its body, and the scales on its underbelly are white or yellow.[33][36] This coloration, which blends well with the gar's surroundings, allows it to ambush its prey.[33][36] The Florida gar has no ganoid scales on its throat.[33] Female Florida gars grow to lengths between 13 and 34 inches, bigger than their male counterparts.[33][36] Spotted gar[edit] Main article: Spotted gar Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) The spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) is a smaller species of gar,[25] measuring just under four feet long and weighing 15 pounds on average.[25] Like Florida gars, female spotted gars are typically larger than male spotted gars.[37] This gar has dark spots covering its head, body, and fins.[25] Its body is compact, and it has a shorter snout.[25] It prefers to live in clearer shallow water with a depth of 3–5 meters,[32] and to surround itself in foliage.[35][37] Its habitat ranges from the waters of Lake Michigan, the Lake Erie Basin, the Mississippi River System, and river drainages along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico from the Nueces River in Texas east to the lower Apalachicola River in Florida.[37][38] It shares its habitat with the alligator gar, its main predator. These smaller gar live an average of 18 years.[37] Shortnose gar[edit] Main article: Shortnose gar Shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus) The shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus) is found in the Mississippi River Basin, Indiana, Wisconsin, Montana, Alabama, and Louisiana.[39] It prefers to live in lakes, swamps, and calm pools.[35][39] The shortnose gar takes its name from its snout, which is shorter and broader than that of other gar species.[25][39] Like the longnose gar, it has one row of teeth. The upper jaw is longer than the rest of its head.[39] The shortnose gar is deep green or brown in color, similar to the alligator gar.[25][39] Depending on the clarity of water, spots can be present on the caudal, dorsal, and anal fins.[39] The shortnose gar has a lifespan of 20 years, reaches up to 5 pounds in weight,[40] and grows to lengths of 24-35 inches.[38][40] It consumes more invertebrates than any other gar,[39] and their stomachs have been found to contain higher Asian carp content than any other native North American fish.[32] Longnose gar[edit] Main article: Longnose gar Longnose Gar (Lepisosteus osseus) The Longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus) has a longer, narrower, more cylindrical body,[25][41] and can be distinguished from other species of gar by its snout, which is more than twice the length of the rest of its head.[42][43] It can reach up to 6 feet and 8 inches in length and weigh up to 35-80 pounds.[25][42] Like the shortnose gar, it has only a single row of teeth.[42][43] Unlike its relatives, it enters brackish water from time to time.[35][42] Females are larger and live longer than the male longnose gar.[41][42] Females living 22 years, and males about half as long.[42] There are spots on the head, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins.[25][42][44] Depending on the water clarity, the longnose gar comes in two colors.[42] In clear water, they're a dark deep green color. In muddy waters, it's more brown in color.[42] Edges of the ganoid scales and in between are black.[42][44] These types of gar are occasionally fished by locals, and blamed for eating other fish in the rivers.[41][42] The longnose gar has a large range of territory in North America, into the Gulf of Mexico.[42][44] Located in Florida, Quebec, all Great Lakes except Lake Superior, Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, and northern Mexico.[42][45] Roe[edit] The flesh of gar is edible, but its eggs contain an ichthyotoxin, a type of protein toxin which is highly toxic to humans.[46][47] The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius,[48] but as the roe's temperature does not typically reach that level when it is cooked, even cooked roe causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs, but bluegills and channel catfish fed gar eggs in experiments remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. Crayfish fed the roe were not immune to the toxin, and most died. The roe's toxicities to humans and crayfish may be coincidences, however, and not the result of explicit natural selection.[46] A gar leaps out of the water. Significance to humans[edit] Several species are traded as aquarium fish.[21] The hard ganoid scales of gars are sometimes used to make jewelry whereas the tough skin is used to make such items as lamp shades. Historically, Native Americans used gar scales as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows with gar skin.[49] Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture other than the ritual "garfish dances" that have been performed by Creek and Chickasaw tribes.[50] References[edit] ^ a b Paulo M.

It has an area of 13.52 square kilometres (5.22 sq mi) and is 39.54 kilometres (24.57 mi) around. It lies at an elevation of 398 metres (1,306 ft) above sea level.[1] Name[edit] The Norse form of the name was probably just *Eini. This name is derived from einir m 'juniper' (referring to the vegetation around the lake). The last element -vatnet (the finite form of vatn n 'water, lake') is a later addition.

As the Cretan hieroglyphs are undeciphered and Linear A only partly deciphered, the Minoan language is unknown and unclassified: indeed, with the existing evidence, it is impossible to be certain that the two scripts record the same language, or even that a single language is recorded in each. The Eteocretan language, attested in a few alphabetic inscriptions from Crete 1,000 years later, is possibly a descendant of Minoan, but is also unclassified. Contents 1 Tradition 1.1 The Egyptian texts 2 Classification 3 Syntax 4 References 5 External links Tradition[edit] Minoan is mainly known from the inscriptions in Linear A, which are fairly legible by comparison with Linear B. The Cretan hieroglyphs are dated from the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. The Linear A texts, mostly written in clay tablets, are spread all over Crete with more than 40 localities on the island. The Egyptian texts[edit] From the 18th dynasty of Egypt there are four texts containing names and sayings in the Keftiu language (de). They are, as usual in non-Egyptian texts, written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, which allow a more precise pronunciation. Magic Papyrus Harris (Latin: Papyrus magicus Harris XII, 1-5); Beg. 18th dynasty: a saying in the Keftiu language [2] Writing board (B.M. 5647); early 18th dynasty: school blackboard with Keftiu name[3] London Medical Papyrus (B.M., 10059); End of the 18th Dynasty: Two Sayings Against Disease (# 32-33) Aegean placard list (de): some Cretan place names. On the basis of these texts, the phonetic system of the Minoan language can be reconstructed, and is considered to have the following consonant phonemes:[4] Consonant phonemes Bilabial Dental Alveolar Palatal Velar Uvular Glottal Nasal m n Stop p b t d ts k q Fricative s ʃ h Trill r Approximant j w Classification[edit] See also: Linear A § Theories regarding language Minoan is an unclassified language, or perhaps multiple indeterminate languages written in the same script. It has been compared inconclusively to the Indo-European and Semitic language families.[5] Syntax[edit] Doctor Brent Davis, a linguist and archaeologist at the University of Melbourne, has discovered that the Linear A word order is verb-subject-object (VSO).[6] References[edit] ^ Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds.

They play their home games at Kings Norton RFC in Hopwood. They are a member of the NFC Division Two South in the BAFA National Leagues. The Bulls are one of the longer established American football teams playing in the United Kingdom, having been founded in 1983, and are one of the most successful teams in British American Football,[1] winning 4 British titles and 19 conference championships. The Bulls field a senior team in the BAFA National Leagues with Matthew Sheldon the Head Coach since 2018. They also field a youth team in the Under 17 system, and in 2019 they announced a partnership with the Black Country Vipers to provide Under 19s football in the Birmingham-Black Country region.

They later took residence in Salford Park, underneath the Gravelly Hill Interchange, and in later years, the club attempted to purchase the land from the local council.[6] In 1986, as members of the BAFL, under coach Warren Tate, the Bulls won their first national championship, and represented the UK in the inaugural Eurobowl, finishing third, losing to eventual runners-up, the Bologna Doves. In 1988, the Bulls won their second national championship, and first in the Budweiser League, beating the London Olympians at Loftus Road 30–6, and again qualifying for the Eurobowl. However, they once more lost to the eventual runners up, this time the Amsterdam Crusaders.[7] In 1989 off-season, the entire Bulls starting secondary was arrested on charges ranging from armed robbery to assault.[8] Now owned by local businessman and Don Ho impersonator Frank Leadon, the team suffered internal strife with American lineman James Thornton regularly threatening to get himself deported,[9] with Leadon himself leaving the club and returning multiple times.[10] Businessman and father of nose tackle Andy Webb, Dave Webb took over ownership of the team part way through the season, with the Bulls' payroll the highest in the league.[11] the Bulls again made the Budweiser Bowl to challenge for the national championship, but just hours before the game, star quarterback and coach, Russ Jensen, left the team for financial reasons.[12] The Bulls lost to the Manchester Spartans 21–14. In the same year, due to protests against Apartheid from the Bulls' supporters club,[13] the team turned down the offer of a tour of South Africa, estimated at the time to be worth $100,000.[14] It was in 1989 that former sportswriter for the Boston Herald, Michael Globetti, joined the Bulls and authored the book God Save The Quarterback!.[15] The Nineties[edit] Under the banner of the NDMA league, the Bulls took their third national championship in 1991, defeating the London Olympians 39–38 at the Alexander Stadium, with kicker Mark Webb scoring the winning field goal with just 17 seconds remaining.[16] In 1992, the Bulls again faced Eurobowl disappointment, falling to the eventual winners, the Amsterdam Crusaders once more. The result of the loss was challenged by the Bulls due to player registration issues, but the appeal failed. This failed appeal was part of the reasoning given for the withdrawal of BAFA from the European governing body.[17] In 1995, the Bulls won their most recent national championship, defeating the London Olympians once more, in a 34–30 game.[18] However, the Olympians got their revenge later in the year, knocking the Bulls out of the Eurobowl at the quarter-final stage, before going onto finish as runners-up. After a re-invention, the Bulls began life in Division 2 in 1996. The Bulls reached the national championship again in 1999, but fell to the London Olympians in a close, defence-heavy 9–6 loss.[19] New Millennium and Recent years[edit] The result of the 1999 Britbowl was repeated a year later in 2000, when the London Olympians again defeated the Bulls in the national championship game, 34–26. There followed a down period in the Bulls history, marked by several play-off appearances, a lone conference championship in 2005, and emerging rivalries with the Coventry Jets and Tamworth Phoenix. As the Bulls attempted to emerge from the mediocrity of the 2000s, they focused heavily on recruitment within the local area, but they still struggled in the BAFA Premier Division North. In 2013, the Bulls junior team finished an undefeated season by defeating the Woodham Warriors in the junior Britbowl at Keepmoat Stadium, and were crowned national champions. This would be the last year that the Bulls fielded a junior team, as a new team was formed through links with the BUAFL team, the Birmingham Lions and the newly founded Sandwell Steelers. In 2014, in the second and final year of former Redditch Arrows head coach Ian Hill's tenure, despite a large rookie contingent, the Bulls came within one game of making the play-offs. 2015 saw a league restructure and the Bulls found themselves placed in the Division One SFC North, with former player, Mark Pagett, taking over the reins.[20] Following a further restructure, the Bulls played the 2016 season in the Midlands Football Conference 1.[21] At the end of the 2017 season the Bulls were relegated into Division Two of the BAFA National League system after winning just one of their ten games. They finished with the same record as Coventry Jets but were relegated based on the head to head record having each won one of the two games but with the Bulls defeat to the Jets by a greater points margin. Head Coach Mark Pagett resigned at the end of the 2017 season with long serving player Matthew Sheldon taking over the reins. The Bulls were placed in the Division 2 NFC South. With an eight-game regular season schedule the Bulls finished with 7 wins and 1 defeat, losing their final league fixture 14–8 at home to Staffordshire Surge which ensure their rivals were crowned division winners. The Bulls entered into the play-offs as the number 4 seed and after a 16–6 win at home to Halton Spartans in the quarter final they faced a long trip north to Aberdeen to face the Roughnecks for a place in the Northern Conference Final where the Bulls fell in a 16–14 defeat. In the 2019 season, the Bulls completed a perfect regular season, finishing 8–0 in the NFC2 South moving into the play-offs as the number 1 seed in the Northern Conference. In the quarter final they faced division rival Staffordshire Surge and won through to the semi finals with a 43–6 victory. In the semi final they once again fell to a Scottish team to miss out on promotion to Division 1, Inverclyde Goliaths securing promotion and Bowl place with a 30–12 victory.[22] In November 2019 the new league structure saw the Bulls moved into the SFC2 Central Division where they will face Ouse Valley Eagles, Worcestershire Black Knights, Northants Knights and Hereford Stampede.

Their facemask colour is black. A cut-out of the Bull from the full team logo is positioned on both sides of the helmet. In 2013, the Bulls celebrated their 30th anniversary[24] and reverted to the use of their original "Three Legged Bull" logo for a season. Their home jerseys are typically black, with white numbers and a red trim, while their away jerseys are reversed, being mainly white, with black numbers and maintaining the red trim. Their game pants for both home and away kits are white, with a black and red stripe running the length of the leg. The Bulls have traditionally worn mostly black socks. As part of a new look for the club from the 2018 season onwards the Bulls play in all black uniforms with the changes making their debut in the opening league fixture with Knottingley Raiders on Sunday 15 April 2018. The spring of 2019 also saw a new club logo announced as part of a move to re-brand the club for a new era. Facilities[edit] In 2019, it was announced the Bulls would move to Kings Norton RFC, moving from their previous facility at Erin Go Bragh in Erdington. Rivalries[edit] London Olympians[edit] The Bulls' rivalry with the London Olympians is largely historic, meeting several times in the late 1980s and early 1990s in both the league and playoffs, with the rivalry coming to a head in the 1988, 1991, 1994 and 1995 Britbowls, with the Bulls winning three to the Olympians one.[25] In recent years, the two have rarely, if at all, played each other due to league realignments and a relative lack of playoff success for both organisations. Coventry Jets[edit] Aside from being purely a local affair, the rivalry became significant when the Jets returned in their latest guise, initiated by several former Bulls, including quarterback Jamie Kilby and Paul Newey. Thanks in part to geographical proximity, the Jets and Bulls faced each other often. In 2008, the Jets handed the Bulls their heaviest defeat, in a very one sided 67–0 affair.[26] In 2017, the Bulls were relegated to Division 2 after a final day defeat to the Jets. In 2018, the Coventry Jets folded, and were incorporated into the Etone Jaguars. Tamworth Phoenix[edit] The Bulls' rivalry with the Tamworth Phoenix is not dissimilar to that of the Jets. Whilst they are geographically close, the rivalry was compounded by the fact that the Phoenix were, like many of the younger Midlands teams, founded by former Birmingham Bulls players.[27] Notable former players[edit] The following notable players appeared for the Birmingham Bulls during their career.

The Bulls field a youth (13-17) and junior (17-19) teams in conjunction with the Black Country Vipers, with the youth team playing under the Bulls' name, and the junior team under the Vipers'.

The race was held before stage 18 of the 2017 Tour de France, between Briançon and the Col d'Izoard, on 20 July, and was followed by a pursuit race before stage 20 of the Tour de France. It was organised by the ASO. The first day counted also as the thirteenth race of the 2017 UCI Women's World Tour.[2] The 2017 race was the first edition in which the event was stretched into a 2-day format. The top twenty finishers on the first day, or those within five minutes of the stage winner on the Col d'Izoard, were eligible to contest the second 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) stage, over the same course as the men's time trial in Marseille on 22 July. However, for the purposes of the UCI world tour, only the results from the first day counted.[3] The pursuit race was held as a 1.15 categorised event,[4] on the French Cycling Federation (FFC) calendar – and therefore did not count towards the UCI Women's World Tour – with riders starting at their respective time gaps from the Col d'Izoard. Both races had the same podium; Annemiek van Vleuten (Orica–Scott) won both races ahead of Boels–Dolmans rider Lizzie Deignan, with the podium being completed each time by Wiggle High5's Elisa Longo Borghini.[5][6] Contents 1 Teams 2 Results 2.1 La Course by Le Tour de France - stage 1 2.2 La Course Poursuite - stage 2 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Teams[edit] 21 teams participated in the 2017 La Course by Le Tour de France.[7] The top 15 UCI Women's World Tour teams were automatically invited, and obliged to attend the race.

For orbits that have a period of one day in general, see geosynchronous orbit. Circular orbit above the Earth's equator and following the direction of the Earth's rotation Two geostationary satellites in the same orbit A 5° × 6° view of a part of the geostationary belt, showing several geostationary satellites. Those with inclination 0° form a diagonal belt across the image; a few objects with small inclinations to the Equator are visible above this line. The satellites are pinpoint, while stars have created small trails due to Earth's rotation. A geostationary orbit, also referred to as a geosynchronous equatorial orbit[a] (GEO), is a circular geosynchronous orbit 35,786 kilometres (22,236 miles) above Earth's equator and following the direction of Earth's rotation. An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period, one sidereal day, and so to ground observers it appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky. The concept of a geostationary orbit was popularised by the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke in the 1940s as a way to revolutionise telecommunications, and the first satellite to be placed in this kind of orbit was launched in 1963. Communications satellites are often placed in a geostationary orbit so that Earth-based satellite antennas (located on Earth) do not have to rotate to track them but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Weather satellites are also placed in this orbit for real-time monitoring and data collection, and navigation satellites to provide a known calibration point and enhance GPS accuracy. Geostationary satellites are launched via a temporary orbit, and placed in a slot above a particular point on the Earth's surface. The orbit requires some stationkeeping to keep its position, and modern retired satellites are placed in a higher graveyard orbit to avoid collisions.

Smith,[1] but Smith did not go into details. British science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke popularised and expanded the concept in a 1945 paper entitled Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?, published in Wireless World magazine. Clarke acknowledged the connection in his introduction to The Complete Venus Equilateral.[2][3] The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites,[3] is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit.[4] Similarly, the collection of artificial satellites in this orbit is known as the Clarke Belt.[5] In technical terminology the orbit is referred to as either a geostationary or geosynchronous equatorial orbit, with the terms used somewhat interchangeably.[6] The first geostationary satellite was designed by Harold Rosen while he was working at Hughes Aircraft in 1959. Inspired by Sputnik 1, he wanted to use a geostationary satellite to globalise communications. Telecommunications between the US and Europe was then possible between just 136 people at a time, and reliant on high frequency radios and an undersea cable.[7] Conventional wisdom at the time was that it would require too much rocket power to place a satellite in a geostationary orbit and it would not survive long enough to justify the expense,[8] so early efforts were put towards constellations of satellites in low or medium Earth orbit.[9] The first of these were the passive Echo balloon satellites in 1960, followed by Telstar 1 in 1962.[10] Although these projects had difficulties with signal strength and tracking, that could be solved through geostationary satellites, the concept was seen as impractical, so Hughes often withheld funds and support.[9][7] By 1961, Rosen and his team had produced a cylindrical prototype with a diameter of 76 centimetres (30 in), height of 38 centimetres (15 in), weighing 11.3 kilograms (25 lb), light and small enough to be placed into orbit. It was spin stabilised with a dipole antenna producing a pancake shaped waveform.[11] In August 1961, they were contracted to begin building the real satellite.[7] They lost Syncom 1 to electronics failure, but Syncom 2 was successfully placed into a geosynchronous orbit in 1963. Although its inclined orbit still required moving antennas, it was able to relay TV transmissions, and allowed for US President John F. Kennedy to phone Nigerian prime minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa from a ship on August 23, 1963.[9][12] The first satellite placed in a geostationary orbit was Syncom 3, which was launched by a Delta D rocket in 1964.[13] With its increased bandwidth, this satellite was able to transmit live coverage of the Summer Olympics from Japan to America. Geostationary orbits have been in common use ever since, in particular for satellite television.[9] Today there are hundreds of geostationary satellites providing remote sensing and communications.[7][14] Although most populated land locations on the planet now have terrestrial communications facilities (microwave, fiber-optic), with telephone access covering 96% of the population and internet access 90%,[15] some rural and remote areas in developed countries are still reliant on satellite communications.[16][17] Uses[edit] See also: Geosynchronous satellite Most commercial communications satellites, broadcast satellites and SBAS satellites operate in geostationary orbits.[18][19][20] Communications[edit] Geostationary communication satellites are useful because they are visible from a large area of the earth's surface, extending 81° away in both latitude and longitude.[21] They appear stationary in the sky, which eliminates the need for ground stations to have movable antennas. This means that Earth-based observers can erect small, cheap and stationary antennas that are always directed at the desired satellite.[22]:537 However, latency becomes significant as it takes about 240ms for a signal to pass from a ground based transmitter on the equator to the satellite and back again.[22]:538 This delay presents problems for latency-sensitive applications such as voice communication,[23] so geostationary communication satellites are primarily used for unidirectional entertainment and applications where low latency alternatives are not available.[24] Geostationary satellites are directly overhead at the equator and appear lower in the sky to an observer nearer the poles. As the observer's latitude increases, communication becomes more difficult due to factors such as atmospheric refraction, Earth's thermal emission, line-of-sight obstructions, and signal reflections from the ground or nearby structures. At latitudes above about 81°, geostationary satellites are below the horizon and cannot be seen at all.[21] Because of this, some Russian communication satellites have used elliptical Molniya and Tundra orbits, which have excellent visibility at high latitudes.[25] Meteorology[edit] See also: Weather satellite A worldwide network of operational geostationary meteorological satellites is used to provide visible and infrared images of Earth's surface and atmosphere for weather observation, oceanography, and atmospheric tracking. As of 2019 there are 19 satellites in either operation or stand-by.[26] These satellite systems include: the United States' GOES series, operated by NOAA[27] the Meteosat series, launched by the European Space Agency and operated by the European Weather Satellite Organization, EUMETSAT[28] the Republic of Korea COMS-1 and[29] GK-2A multi mission satellites.[30] the Russian Elektro-L satellites the Japanese Himawari series[31] Chinese Fengyun series[32] India's INSAT series[33] These satellites typically captures images in the visual and infrared spectrum with a spatial resolution between 0.5 and 4 square kilometres.[34] The coverage is typically 70°,[34] and in some cases less.[35] Geostationary satellite imagery has been used for tracking volcanic ash,[36] measuring cloud top temperatures and water vapour, oceanography,[37] measuring land temperature and vegetation coverage,[38][39] facilitating cyclone path prediction,[33] and providing real time cloud coverage and other tracking data.[40] Some information has been incorporated into meteorological prediction models, but due to their wide field of view, full-time monitoring and lower resolution, geostationary weather satellite images are primarily used for short-term and real-time forecasting.[41][39] Navigation[edit] Further information: GNSS augmentation Service areas of satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS).[19] Geostationary satellites can be used to augment GNSS systems by relaying clock, ephemeris and ionospheric error corrections (calculated from ground stations of a known position) and providing an additional reference signal.[42] This improves position accuracy from approximately 5m to 1m or less.[43] Past and current navigation systems that use geostationary satellites include: The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), operated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), operated by the ESSP (on behalf of EU's GSA); The Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), operated by Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB); The GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) system being operated by India.[44][45] The commercial StarFire navigation system, operated by John Deere and C-Nav Positioning Solutions (Oceaneering); The commercial Starfix DGPS System and OmniSTAR system, operated by Fugro.[46] Implementation[edit] Launch[edit] See also: Geostationary transfer orbit An example of a transition from temporary GTO to GSO. EchoStar XVII · Earth. Geostationary satellites are launched to the east into a prograde orbit that matches the rotation rate of the equator. The smallest inclination that a satellite can be launched into is that of the launch site's latitude, so launching the satellite from close to the equator limits the amount of inclination change needed later.[47] Additionally, launching from close to the equator allows the speed of the Earth's rotation to give the satellite a boost. A launch site should have water or deserts to the east, so any failed rockets do not fall on a populated area.[48] Most launch vehicles place geostationary satellites directly into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), an elliptical orbit with an apogee at GEO height and a low perigee. On-board satellite propulsion is then used to raise the perigee, circularise and reach GEO.[47][49] Orbit allocation[edit] Satellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above the equator. The requirement to space these satellites apart, to avoid harmful radio-frequency interference during operations, means that there are a limited number of orbital slots available, and thus only a limited number of satellites can be operated in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries near the same longitude but differing latitudes) and radio frequencies. These disputes are addressed through the International Telecommunication Union's allocation mechanism under the Radio Regulations.[50][51] In the 1976 Bogotá Declaration, eight countries located on the Earth's equator claimed sovereignty over the geostationary orbits above their territory, but the claims gained no international recognition.[52] Statite proposal[edit] A statite is a hypothetical satellite that uses radiation pressure from the sun against a solar sail to modify its orbit. It would hold its location over the dark side of the Earth at a latitude of approximately 30 degrees. A statite is stationary relative to the Earth and Sun system rather than compared to surface of the Earth, and could ease congestion in the geostationary ring.[53][54] Retired satellites[edit] Geostationary satellites require some station keeping to keep their position, and once they run out of thruster fuel they are generally retired. The transponders and other onboard systems often outlive the thruster fuel and by allowing the satellite to move naturally into an inclined geosynchronous orbit some satellites can remain in use,[55] or else be elevated to a graveyard orbit. This process is becoming increasingly regulated and satellites must have a 90% chance of moving over 200 km above the geostationary belt at end of life.[56] Space debris[edit] Main article: Space debris § Characterization A computer-generated image of space debris. Two debris fields are shown: around geostationary space and low Earth orbit. Space debris at geostationary orbits typically has a lower collision speed than at LEO since all GEO satellites orbit in the same plane, altitude and speed; however, the presence of satellites in eccentric orbits allows for collisions at up to 4 km/s. Although a collision is comparatively unlikely, GEO satellites have a limited ability to avoid any debris.[57] Debris less than 10 cm in diameter cannot be seen from the Earth, making it difficult to assess their prevalence.[58] Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on August 11, 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit,[59] and in 2006 the Russian Express-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable,[60] although its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit. In 2017 both AMC-9 and Telkom-1 broke apart from an unknown cause.[61][58][62] Properties[edit] A typical geostationary orbit has the following properties: Inclination: 0° Period: 1436 minutes (one sidereal day)[22]:121 Eccentricity: 0 Argument of perigee: undefined Semi-major axis: 42,164 km Inclination[edit] An inclination of zero ensures that the orbit remains over the equator at all times, making it stationary with respect to latitude from the point of view of a ground observer (and in the ECEF reference frame).[22]:122 Period[edit] The orbital period is equal to exactly one sidereal day. This means that the satellite will return to the same point above the Earth's surface every (sidereal) day, regardless of other orbital properties. For a geostationary orbit in particular, it ensures that it holds the same longitude over time.[22]:121 This orbital period, T, is directly related to the semi-major axis of the orbit through the formula: T = 2 π a 3 μ {\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {a^{3} \over \mu }}} where: a is the length of the orbit's semi-major axis μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body[22]:137 Eccentricity[edit] The eccentricity is zero, which produces a circular orbit. This ensures that the satellite does not move closer or further away from the Earth, which would cause it to track backwards and forwards across the sky.[22]:122 Orbital stability[edit] A geostationary orbit can be achieved only at an altitude very close to 35,786 kilometres (22,236 miles) and directly above the equator. This equates to an orbital speed of 3.07 kilometres per second (1.91 miles per second) and an orbital period of 1,436 minutes, one sidereal day. This ensures that the satellite will match the Earth's rotational period and has a stationary footprint on the ground. All geostationary satellites have to be located on this ring. A combination of lunar gravity, solar gravity, and the flattening of the Earth at its poles causes a precession motion of the orbital plane of any geostationary object, with an orbital period of about 53 years and an initial inclination gradient of about 0.85° per year, achieving a maximal inclination of 15° after 26.5 years.[63][22]:156 To correct for this perturbation, regular orbital stationkeeping maneuvers are necessary, amounting to a delta-v of approximately 50 m/s per year.[64] A second effect to be taken into account is the longitudinal drift, caused by the asymmetry of the Earth – the equator is slightly elliptical.[22]:156 There are two stable equilibrium points (at 75.3°E and 108°W) and two corresponding unstable points (at 165.3°E and 14.7°W). Any geostationary object placed between the equilibrium points would (without any action) be slowly accelerated towards the stable equilibrium position, causing a periodic longitude variation.[63] The correction of this effect requires station-keeping maneuvers with a maximal delta-v of about 2 m/s per year, depending on the desired longitude.[64] Solar wind and radiation pressure also exert small forces on satellites: over time, these cause them to slowly drift away from their prescribed orbits.[65] In the absence of servicing missions from the Earth or a renewable propulsion method, the consumption of thruster propellant for station-keeping places a limitation on the lifetime of the satellite. Hall-effect thrusters, which are currently in use, have the potential to prolong the service life of a satellite by providing high-efficiency electric propulsion.[64] Derivation of geostationary altitude[edit] Comparison of geostationary Earth orbit with GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Compass (medium Earth orbit) satellite navigation system orbits with the International Space Station, Hubble Space Telescope and Iridium constellation orbits, and the nominal size of the Earth.[b] The Moon's orbit is around 9 times larger (in radius and length) than geostationary orbit.[c] For circular orbits around a body, the centripetal force required to maintain the orbit (Fc) is equal to the gravitational force acting on the satellite (Fg):[66] F c = F g {\displaystyle F_{c}=F_{g}} From Isaac Newton's Universal law of gravitation, F g = G M E m s r 2 {\displaystyle F_{g}=G{\frac {M_{E}m_{s}}{r^{2}}}} , where Fg is the gravitational force acting between two objects, ME is the mass of the Earth, 5.9736 × 1024 kg, ms is the mass of the satellite, r is the distance between the centers of their masses, and G is the gravitational constant, (6.67428 ± 0.00067) × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2.[66] The magnitude of the acceleration (a) of a body moving in a circle is given by: a = v 2 r {\displaystyle a={\frac {v^{2}}{r}}} where v is the magnitude of the velocity (i.e. the speed) of the satellite. From Newton's Second law of Motion, the centripetal force Fc is given by: F c = m s v 2 r {\displaystyle F_{c}=m_{s}{\frac {v^{2}}{r}}} .[66] As Fc = Fg, m s v 2 r = G M E m s r 2 {\displaystyle m_{s}{\frac {v^{2}}{r}}=G{\frac {M_{E}m_{s}}{r^{2}}}} , so that v 2 = G M E r {\displaystyle {v^{2}}=G{\frac {M_{E}}{r}}} Replacing v with the equation for the speed of an object moving around a circle produces: ( 2 π r T ) 2 = G M E r {\displaystyle \left({\frac {2\pi r}{T}}\right)^{2}=G{\frac {M_{E}}{r}}} where T is the orbital period (i.e. one sidereal day), and is equal to 86164.09054 s.[67] This gives an equation for r:[68] r = G M E T 2 4 π 2 3 {\displaystyle r={\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {G{M_{E}}T^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}}}}} The product GME is known with much greater precision than either factor alone; it is known as the geocentric gravitational constant μ = 398,600.4418 ± 0.0008 km3 s−2. Hence r = μ T 2 4 π 2 3 {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ={\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {{\boldsymbol {\mu }}\mathbf {T} ^{2}}{\mathbf {4} {\boldsymbol {\pi }}^{2}}}}} The resulting orbital radius is 42,164 kilometres (26,199 miles). Subtracting the Earth's equatorial radius, 6,378 kilometres (3,963 miles), gives the altitude of 35,786 kilometres (22,236 miles).[69] The orbital speed is calculated by multiplying the angular speed by the orbital radius: v = ω r ≈ 3074.6 m/s {\displaystyle v=\omega r\quad \approx 3074.6~{\text{m/s}}} Mars[edit] By the same method, we can determine the orbital altitude for any similar pair of bodies, including the areostationary orbit of an object in relation to Mars, if it is assumed that it is spherical (which it is not).[70] The gravitational constant GM (μ) for Mars has the value of 42,830 km3s−2, its equatorial radius is 3389.50 km and the known rotational period (T) of the planet is 1.02595676 Earth days (88,642.66 seconds). Using these values, Mars' orbital altitude is equal to 17,039 km.[71] See also[edit] Spaceflight portal List of orbits List of satellites in geosynchronous orbit Orbital stationkeeping Space elevator, which ultimately reaches a geostationary orbit Notes[edit] ^ Geostationary orbit and Geosynchronous (equatorial) orbit are used somewhat interchangeably in sources. ^ Orbital periods and speeds are calculated using the relations 4π2R3 = T2GM and V2R = GM, where R = radius of orbit in metres, T = orbital period in seconds, V = orbital speed in m/s, G = gravitational constant ≈ 6.673×10−11 Nm2/kg2, M = mass of Earth ≈ 5.98×1024 kg. ^ The Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular, and is approximately 8.6 times further away from the Earth than the geostationary ring when the Moon is at perigee (363 104 km ÷ 42 164 km) and 9.6 times further away when the Moon is at apogee (405,696 km ÷ 42,164 km).

First edition title page. Esther Waters is a novel by George Moore first published in 1894. Contents 1 Introduction 2 Plot summary 3 Stage and film adaptations 4 See also 5 Read on 6 Footnotes 7 References 8 External links Introduction[edit] Set in England from the early 1870s onward, the novel is about a young, pious woman from a poor working-class family who, while working as a kitchen maid, is seduced by another employee, becomes pregnant, is deserted by her lover, and against all odds decides to raise her child as a single mother. Esther Waters is one of a group of Victorian novels that depict the life of a "fallen woman". Written in a Zola-like naturalistic style, the novel stands out among Moore's publications as the book whose immediate success, including Gladstone's approval of the novel in the Westminster Gazette,[1] brought him financial security. Moore's fellow late nineteenth century novelist' George Gissing, wrote there was "some pathos and power in latter part, but miserable writing. The dialogue often grotesquely phrased".[2] Continuously revised by Moore (1899, 1917, 1920, 1931), it is often regarded as his best novel. Esther Waters is dedicated to T. W. Rolleston. Plot summary[edit] Esther Waters is born to hard-working parents who are Plymouth Brethren in Barnstaple. Her father's premature death prompts her mother to move to London and marry again, but Esther's stepfather turns out to be a hard-drinking bully and wife-beater who forces Esther, a natural beauty, to leave school and go out to work instead, thus greatly reducing her chances of ever learning how to read and write, and Esther remains illiterate all her life. Her first job ("situation") outside London is that of a kitchen maid with the Barfields, a nouveau riche family of horse breeders, horse racers and horse betters who live at Woodview near Shoreham. There she meets William Latch, a footman, and is seduced by him. Dreaming of a future with Latch, she is dismayed to find that he is having an affair with the Barfields' niece, who is staying at Woodview. After Latch and his lover have eloped together, Esther stays on at Woodview until she cannot hide her pregnancy any longer. Although she has found a kindred soul in Mrs Barfield, who is also a Plymouth Sister and abhors the betting on horses going on all around her, Esther is dismissed ("I couldn't have kept you on, on account of the bad example to the younger servants") and reluctantly goes back to London. With the little money she has saved, she can stay in a rented room out of her stepfather's sight. Her mother is pregnant with her eighth child and dies giving birth to it at the same time Esther is at Queen Charlotte's Hospital giving birth to a healthy boy she calls Jackie. Still in confinement, she is visited by her younger sister who asks her for money for her passage to Australia, where her whole family have decided to emigrate. Esther never hears of them again. Learning that a young mother in her situation can make good money by becoming a wet nurse, Esther leaves her newborn son in the care of a baby farmer and nurses the weakly child of a wealthy woman ("Rich folk don't suckle their own") who, out of fear of infection, forbids Esther any contact with Jack. When, after two long weeks, she finally sees her son again, realises that he is anything but prospering and even believes that his life might be in danger, she immediately takes him with her, terminates her employment without notice and then sees no other way than to "accept the shelter of the workhouse" for herself and Jack. But Esther is lucky, and after only a few months can leave the workhouse again. She chances upon Mrs Lewis, a lonely widow living in East Dulwich who is both willing and able to raise her boy in her stead, while she herself goes into service again. However, she is not able to really settle down anywhere: either the work is so hard and the hours so long that, fearing for her health, she quits again; or she is dismissed when her employers find out about the existence of her illegitimate son, concluding that she is a "loose" woman who must not work in a respectable household. Later on, while hiding her son's existence, she is fired when the son of the house, in his youthful fervour, makes passes at her and eventually writes her a love letter she cannot read. Another stroke of luck in her otherwise dreary life is her employment as general servant in West Kensington with Miss Rice, a novelist who is very sympathetic to her problems ("Esther could not but perceive the contrast between her own troublous life and the contented privacy of this slender little spinster's"). While working there, she makes the acquaintance of Fred Parsons, a Plymouth Brother and political agitator, who proposes to Esther at about the same time she bumps into William Latch again while on an errand for her mistress. Latch, who has amassed a small fortune betting on horses and as a bookmaker ("I am worth to-day close on three thousand pounds"), is the proprietor of a licensed public house in Soho and has separated from his adulterous wife, waiting for his marriage to be divorced. He immediately declares his unceasing love for Esther and urges her to live with him and work behind the bar of his pub. Esther realises that she has arrived at a crossroads and that she must make up her mind between the sheltered, serene and religious life Parsons is offering her—which she is really longing for—and sharing the financially secure but turbulent existence of a successful small-time entrepreneur who, as she soon finds out, operates on both sides of the law. Eventually, for the sake of her son's future, she decides to go to Soho with Latch, and after his divorce has come through the couple get married. A number of years of relative happiness follow. Jack, now in his teens, can be sent off to school, and Esther even has her own servant. But Latch is a gambler, and nothing can stop him from risking most of the money he has in the vague hope of gaining even more. Illegal betting is conducted in an upstairs private bar, but more and more also across the counter, until the police clamp down on his activities, his licence is revoked, and he has to pay a heavy fine. This coincides with Latch developing a chronic, sometimes bloody, cough, contracting pneumonia, and finally, in his mid-thirties, being diagnosed with tuberculosis ("consumption"). However, rather than not touching what little money he still has for his wife and son's sake, the dying man puts everything on one horse, loses, and dies a few days later. With Miss Rice also dead, Esther has no place to turn to and again takes on any menial work she can get hold of. Then she remembers Mrs Barfield, contacts her and, when asked to come to Woodview as her servant, gladly accepts while Jack, now old enough to earn his own living, stays behind in London. When she arrives there, Esther finds the once proud estate in a state of absolute disrepair, with Mrs Barfield the only inhabitant. Mistress and maid develop an increasingly intimate relationship with each other and, for the first time in their lives, can practise their religion unhindered. Looking back on her "life of trouble and strife," Esther, now about 40, says she has been able to fulfil her task—to see her boy "settled in life," and thus does not see any reason whatsoever to want to get married again. In the final scene of the novel, Jack, who has become a soldier, visits the two women at Woodview. Stage and film adaptations[edit] Further information: Esther Waters (film) The reason why Moore chose Esther Waters rather than one of his lesser known novels (which he might have been able to promote that way) to be adapted for the stage may have been its "Englishness". The subject-matter of Esther Waters was the most "English" of his novels, and Moore had just returned to England after abandoning his brief interest in the Irish Renaissance theatre movement. 1911, then, saw the première, at the Apollo Theatre in London's West End, of Esther Waters: a play in five acts, which Moore had adapted from his own novel. Although it did not receive good reviews, Moore was pleased with the production. In 1913 Heinemann published the playscript. There are, however, two more versions of the play. One was the result of an unsuccessful collaboration, in 1922, between Moore and theatre critic Barrett H. Clark; a third version of the play was written by Clark in the same year, but never performed. The two 1922 versions were first published in 1984.[3] Esther Waters was filmed in 1948 by Ian Dalrymple and Peter Proud with Kathleen Ryan (in the title role), Dirk Bogarde (as William Latch), Cyril Cusack, Ivor Barnard and Fay Compton. It was partly filmed at Folkington Manor, East Sussex. Two television dramas (miniseries) were produced in 1964 and 1977 respectively.[4] In 1964 the BBC produced a four-part miniseries of Esther Waters, with Meg Wynn Owen in the title role.[5] See also[edit] Novels portal Victorian literature Women in the Victorian era New Woman Read on[edit] William Hale White (writing as Mark Rutherford): Clara Hopgood (controversially educated and independent sisters who shun convention leave their provincial home for London trying to gain social acceptance for Clara's illegitimate child) Margaret Drabble: The Millstone (unmarried young academic becomes pregnant after a one-night stand in early 1960s London and decides to give birth to her child and raise it herself) Ödön von Horváth: Geschichten aus dem Wienerwald (naive young woman must pay bitterly when she breaks off her reluctant engagement with a butcher after falling in love with a fop who, however, has no serious interest in returning her love) Arthur Schnitzler: Therese (woman toils to provide for her illegitimate son, who in the end turns against her) For more works of literature with female protagonists, see the List of literary works with eponymous heroines.

In addition to being the first railway in Shikoku, it was also the third private railway in Japan.[1] It is named for the former Iyo Province. The first tramway was electrified in 1911, whilst the entire tram network was changed from 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) gauge to 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge in 1923.[2] Services[edit] Railway[edit] route map Iyotetsu operates the following railway lines. ■ Takahama Line: Takahama — Matsuyama City ■ Yokogawara Line: Matsuyama City — Yokogawara: ■ Gunchū Line: Matsuyama City — Gunchū Port: Takahama Line[edit] This 9.4 km line opened as 762 mm (2 ft 6 in) gauge in 1888, and was regauged to 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in), double-tracked to Baishinji (8.2 km) and electrified at 600 V DC in 1931. This line is still electrified at 600 V DC, not increased to 750 V DC as Yokogawara or Gunchū Lines.[3] The Takahama Line and the Ōtemachi Tramline have one of the few remaining rail/tram level crossings in Japan.[4] Yokogawara Line[edit] This 13.2 km line opened as 762 mm (2 ft 6 in) gauge in 1893, and was regauged to 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) in 1931. Steam locomotives were replaced by diesel traction in 1954, and the line was electrified at 750 V DC in 1967. Through services to and from the Takahama line commenced in 1981.[3] Gunchū Line[edit] The initial 10.7 km line was opened as a 762 mm (2 ft 6 in) gauge line in 1896 by the South Iyo Railway. Iyotetsu acquired it through merger in 1900. It was regauged to 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) in 1937.[3] In 1939, a 600 m extension opened to Gunchuko, enabling a transfer to JR Iyo station (today Iyoshi on the Yosan Line.[5] The line was electrified in 1950 at 600 V DC, increased to 750 V DC in 1976.[3] CTC signalling was introduced on the rail system in 1993.[3] Former connecting lines[edit] A 4.4 km 762 mm gauge line opened from Iyo Tachibana (on the Takahama line) to Morimatsu in 1896, the line being regauged to 1,067 mm in 1931. The line closed in 1965.[6] Tram[edit] Iyotetsu operates the Matsuyama City Lines (松山市内線, Matsuyama Shinai-sen), a system of five interconnected tram (路面電車, romen-densha) lines.

On 26 October 2017 at the PT. Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses, a fireworks manufacturing factory in Kosambi, Tangerang. The explosion occurred in a warehouse connected to the factory and ignited a massive fire. 103 people were working at the factory at the time of the explosion. At least 49 people were killed and 46 others were injured in the incident.[2][3] Authorities confirmed that several people were still missing. It was the deadliest industrial accident in Indonesia and one of the deadliest fire-related industrial incident in Indonesia. Initial investigation by the Indonesian National Police suggested that an accidental ignition of gunpowder caused the blast and fire.[4] Contents 1 Explosion 2 Casualties 3 Investigation 4 References Explosion[edit] According to eyewitnesses, two explosions occurred at the site of the factory.[5][6] The first explosion took place around 08:30 AM local time.[7] The force of the explosion shook windows that were located at a radius of 4 km from the blast site. The first explosion caused a massive fire inside the factory. The second explosion occurred around three hours later. A reported 103 workers were employed at the factory. The rooftops of the factory were flung due to the force of the explosion. Nearby residents stated that the explosion was similar to a massive bomb. Students at a nearby junior high school reportedly panicked, crying and poured into the street.[1] They were later evacuated by their teachers. [6] The factory and the storage was not in the same building. However, the explosion ignited a fire and the fire managed to spread to the factory. Eyewitnesses reported that women and teenagers were working at the factory when the explosion occurred. As the fire spread, panicked workers tried to flee from the site. As the fire started in the front part of the factory, factory workers fled to the backside of the factory. [8] Eyewitnesses reportedly heard screams from the victims. Victims were also reportedly heard banging on the doors. Several people managed to get out from the factory in time by going through the flames and climbing the front gate. However, most suffered burn injuries. An eyewitness stated that a woman was on fire while trying to flee from the factory. Several other survivors suffered injuries due to falls. [9] The Tangerang Fire Brigade dispatched 7 fire engines to the scene.[10] At least 3 ambulances were also dispatched to the disaster site. Bomb squad personnel were also dispatched by the police to secure the area. Police later cordoned off the area. Initial examination of the site suggested that several people had died during the fire and most of them were burnt beyond recognition. According to the police, most of the bodies were concentrated into a single area in the back of the factory. [11] The factory had reportedly been in operation for under 2 months.[12] 46 people were injured in the disaster.[1] All of them were transported to the local regional hospital.[13] Police quickly recovered 23 bodies from the blast site.[14] The death toll was later revised to 39 as police recovered more bodies from the site. As of 27 October, the death toll stood at 47, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. Police later advised people to stay away from the factory and its nearby area. 2 people later succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to 49.[15] Casualties[edit] 103 people were present during the explosion. According to the police, 49 people had died due to the fire and the explosions. 2 of the dead had succumbed to their injuries. The first victim was identified by the police as 14-year old Surnah. On the following day, the Indonesian National Police managed to identify at least 15 victims of the disaster. 10 people were immediately listed as missing by the police. 7 of them were later found to be safe.[16] The other three were still searched by the police. Investigation[edit] In response to the disaster, the Indonesian Government formed a special commission to investigate the cause of the fire.[17] According to the Indonesian National Police, the government had issued a legal license for the factory in 2016. In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, the license was frozen by the government. The government later issued an order to evaluate every firework factories in and around Tangerang. The same order was also issued by the Governor of Banten Wahidin Halim.[18] Initial investigation revealed that according to the license that the factory was holding, the factory was registered as a toy factory instead of a firework factory. This means that the manufacturing of fireworks inside the factory is illegal. This finding could bring charges to the owners of the factory. Further findings revealed that there factory was only allowed to hire only 10 employees instead of 103[19]. There were also child labors inside the factory. Examination on the victims revealed that several of the dead were teenagers with ages ranging from 14 to 16. Indonesia National Commission of Human Rights also reported that the workers of the factory were underpaid.[20] Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration investigated the factory for possible violations on the work safety procedures.[21][22] They were also asked by the Indonesian House of Representatives to immediately visit the disaster site.[23] Minister of Manpower Hanif Dakhiri stated that the ministry had formed a team to investigate possible violations on the work safety procedures.[24] On 28 October, it was revealed that a spark from welding accidentally sparked the fire. According to the Indonesian National Police, welders Subarna Ega and Husnul were ordered by their boss Andri Hartanto to weld near an area where the fireworks were being laid on the ground.[25] Spark from the welding accidentally contacted the 4,000 kilograms gunpowders. It immediately exploded into a massive fireball which caused the fire. Husnul managed to flee before the explosion. Subarna Ega was later declared as a suspect by the police. Police suspected that he had died during the explosion. [26] References[edit] ^ a b c "Suara Ledakan Pabrik Petasan Bikin Siswa SMP 1 Kosambi Berhamburan". Detik.

Mikhail Dmitrievich Levashov (Russian: Михаи́л Дми́триевич Левашо́в; c. 1738–1774-76) was a Russian explorer and Lieutenant of the Imperial Russian Navy. After Vitus Bering's 1741 tragic venture he was, together with Peter Kuzmich Krenitzin, among the first to conduct an expedition to Alaska and the Aleutians. Life[edit] Levashev was sent by Russian Empress Catherine II, as main assistant of expedition leader Krenitzin, to explore the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean and particularly the area around the Bering strait on four ships. Levashev was the commander of ship St. Paul, while Krenitzin was in command of the St. Catherine.[1] Krenitzin and Levashev surveyed the eastern part of the Aleutian island chain. In 1768-69 Levashef wintered in a natural harbor in Unalaska. The following year, after resuming their explorations, both ships wintered in Kamchatka. Certain geographic features of the Alaskan coast, like Avatanak and Akutan Island were named by Krenitzin and Levashev in the maps that were subsequently published. On 4 July 1770, when Krenitzin drowned, Levashef assumed command of the Russian expedition fleet and returned to St. Petersburg, where he arrived on 22 October 1771. Port Levashef, the harbor in Unalaska where Levashev had wintered his first year in the Northern Pacific was named in honor of this early Russian explorer by Lieutenant Gavril Sarychev.[2] References[edit] ^ COXE, William.

He constructed the Torana (arc gate) of the city and a temple dedicated to Goddess Toran on Bhadrapad Sud 10 in Vikram Samvat 1414 (1358 AD).[8][9] The legend is corroborated in Pragat Prabhavi Parshwanath athva Parshwanathna Chamatkaro published in Vikram Samvat 1909 (1823 AD) by Manilal Nyalchand Shah who also mentioned in it that Mehsaji built a temple dedicated to Chamunda. Another legend says that Mehsaji established the town in Vikram Samvat 1375 (1319 AD). Both legends describes that the town is named after Mehsaji. These legends also inconclusively establish that the town was founded during the Rajput period.[9][10][11] Gaekwads conquered Baroda and established Baroda State in 1721. They expanded their rule in north Gujarat and established Patan as its administrative headquarters. Later the headquarters was moved to Kadi and subsequently to Mehsana in 1902 when the city was coonected by the Gaekwar's Baroda State Railway which was opened on 21 March 1887.

On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, a British force led by Major General Robert Ross set fire to multiple government and military buildings, including the White House (then called the Presidential Mansion), the Capitol building, as well as other facilities of the U.S. government.[3] The attack was in part a retaliation for the recent American destruction of Port Dover in Upper Canada. The Burning of Washington marks the only time since the American Revolutionary War that a foreign power has captured and occupied the capital of the United States. President James Madison, military officials, and his government fled the city in the wake of the British victory at Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the "United States Capital for a Day". President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still exists. Less than a day after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstorm—possibly a hurricane—put out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away. Following the storm, the British returned to their ships, many of which required repairs due to the storm. The occupation of Washington lasted for roughly 26 hours and the British plans are still a subject of debate.

Reinforcements were held back from Canada and reliance was instead made on local militias and native allies to bolster the British Army in Canada. However, after the defeat and exile of Napoleon Bonaparte in April 1814, Britain was able to use its now available troops and ships to prosecute its war with the United States. The Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched an army brigade and additional naval vessels to Bermuda, from where a blockade of the US coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. It was decided to use these forces in raids along the Atlantic seaboard to draw American forces away from Canada.[4] The commanders were under strict orders, however, not to carry out operations far inland, or to attempt to hold territory. Early in 1814, Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's North America and West Indies Station, controlling naval forces based at the new Bermuda dockyard and the Halifax Naval Yard which were used to blockade US Atlantic ports throughout the war. He planned to carry the war into the United States by attacks in Virginia and against New Orleans.[5] Admiralty House, Mount Wyndham, Bermuda, where the attack was planned Rear Admiral George Cockburn had commanded the squadron in Chesapeake Bay since the previous year. On June 25, he wrote to Cochrane stressing that the defenses there were weak, and he felt that several major cities were vulnerable to attack.[6] Cochrane suggested attacking Baltimore, Washington, and Philadelphia. On July 17, Cockburn recommended Washington as the target, because of the comparative ease of attacking the national capital and "the greater political effect likely to result".[7] General Ross commanded a 4,500-man army, composed of the 4th (King's Own) Regiment of Foot, 21st (Royal North British Fusilier) Regiment of Foot, 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot, and 85th Regiment of Foot. An added motive was retaliation for what Britain saw as the "wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie" by American forces under Col. John Campbell in May, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover.[8] On June 2, Sir George Prévost, Governor General of British North America (his actual office was Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty’s Forces in the said Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, and in the islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton and the Bermudas, &c. &c. &c.; beneath Prevost, the staff of the British Army in the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda were under the Command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. Below Sherbrooke, the Bermuda Garrison was under the immediate control of the Governor of Bermuda, Major-General George Horsford[9]), wrote to Cochrane at Admiralty House, in Bailey's Bay, Bermuda, calling for a retaliation against the American destruction of private property in violation of the laws of war. Prévost argued that, ... in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.[8] On July 18, Cochrane ordered Cockburn to "deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages ... You are hereby required and directed to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as you may find assailable".[10] Cochrane instructed, "You will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of the United States". Ross and Cockburn surveyed the torching of the President's Mansion, during which time a great storm arose unexpectedly out of the southeast. They were confronted a number of times while on horseback by older women from around Washington City and elderly clergymen (Southern Presbyterian and Southern Baptist), with women and children who had been hiding in homes and churches. They requested protection from abuse and robbery by enlisted personnel from the British Expeditionary Forces whom they accused of having tried to ransack private homes and other buildings. Major-General Ross had two British soldiers put in chains for violation of his general order. Throughout the events of that day, a severe storm blew into the city, worsening on the night of August 24, 1814.[citation needed] Events[edit] Burning of Washington August 1814 President James Madison, members of his government, and the military fled the city in the wake of the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the "United States' Capital for a Day." President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville.[11] The sappers and miners of the Corps of Royal Engineers under Captain Blanshard were employed in burning the principal buildings. Blanshard reported that it seemed that the American President was so sure that the attacking force would be made prisoners that a handsome entertainment had been prepared. Blanshard and his sappers enjoyed the feast.[12]:358 U.S. Capitol[edit] The United States Capitol after the burning of Washington, D.C. in the War of 1812. Watercolor and ink depiction from 1814, restored. The Capitol was, according to some contemporary travelers, the only building in Washington "worthy to be noticed."[13] Thus, it was a prime target for the British invaders, both for its aesthetic and symbolic value. Upon arrival into the city via Maryland Avenue, the British targeted the Capitol (first the southern wing, containing the House of Representatives, then the northern wing, containing the Senate).[14] Prior to setting it aflame, the British looted the building (which at that time housed Congress, the Library of Congress, and the Supreme Court). Items looted by Admiral Cockburn included a ledger entitled "An account of the receipts and expenditures of the United States for the year 1810"; the admiral wrote on the inside leaf that it was "taken in President's room in the Capitol, at the destruction of that building by the British, on the capture of Washington, 24th August, 1814". He later gave it to his elder brother Sir James Cockburn, 9th Baronet, the Governor of Bermuda. The book was eventually returned to the Library of Congress in 1940.[15] The British intended to burn the building to the ground. They set fire to the southern wing first. The flames grew so quickly that the British were prevented from collecting enough wood to burn the stone walls completely. However, the Library of Congress's contents in the northern wing contributed to the flames on that side.[16] Among the items destroyed was the 3,000-volume collection of the Library of Congress [17] and the intricate decorations of the neoclassical columns, pediments, and sculptures. Later, former president Thomas Jefferson donated his personal book collection to start a new Library of Congress,[18] originally designed by William Thornton in 1793 and Benjamin Latrobe in 1803.[19] The wooden ceilings and floors burned, and the glass skylights melted because of the intense heat.[16] The building was not a complete loss though; the House rotunda, the east lobby, the staircases, and Latrobe's famous Corn-Cob Columns in the Senate entrance hall all survived.[16] The Superintendent of the Public Buildings of the City of Washington, Thomas Munroe, concluded that the loss to the Capitol amounted to $787,163.28, with $457,388.36 for the North wing and main building, and $329,774.92 for the South wing.[20] White House[edit] The White House ruins after the conflagration of August 24, 1814. Watercolor by George Munger, displayed at the White House. After burning the Capitol, the British turned northwest up Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House. After US government officials and President Madison fled the city, the First Lady Dolley Madison received a letter from her husband, urging her to be prepared to leave Washington at a moment's notice.[21] Dolley organized the slaves and staff to save valuables from the British.[22] James Madison's personal slave, the fifteen-year-old boy Paul Jennings, was an eyewitness.[23] After later buying his freedom from the widow Dolley Madison, Jennings published his memoir in 1865, considered the first from the White House: Major-General Robert Ross, British commander who led the attack on Washington It has often been stated in print, that when Mrs. Madison escaped from the White House, she cut out from the frame the large portrait of Washington (now in one of the parlors there), and carried it off. She had no time for doing it. It would have required a ladder to get it down. All she carried off was the silver in her reticule, as the British were thought to be but a few squares off, and were expected any moment.[24] Jennings said the people who saved the painting and removed the objects actually were: John Susé (Jean Pierre Sioussat, the French door-keeper, and still living at the time of Jennings's memoir) and Magraw [McGraw], the President's gardener, took it down and sent it off on a wagon, with some large silver urns and such other valuables as could be hastily got hold of. When the British did arrive, they ate up the very dinner, and drank the wines, &c., that I had prepared for the President's party.[24][25][26] The soldiers burned the president's house, and fuel was added to the fires that night to ensure they would continue burning into the next day. In 2009, President Barack Obama held a ceremony at the White House to honor Jennings as a representative of his contributions to saving the Gilbert Stuart painting and other valuables. (The painting that was saved was a copy Stuart made of the painting, not the original,[27] although it is the same one on display in the East Room.) "A dozen descendants of Jennings came to Washington, to visit the White House. They looked at the painting their relative helped save."[28] In an interview with National Public Radio, Jennings' great-great-grandson Hugh Alexander said, "We were able to take a family portrait in front of the painting, which was for me one of the high points."[23] He confirmed that Jennings later purchased his freedom from the widowed Dolley Madison.[23] Other Washington properties[edit] Portrait of Admiral Cockburn at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, with Washington burning in the background. The U.S. Capitol and Treasury Building are at far right. The day after the destruction of the White House, Rear Admiral Cockburn entered the building of the D.C. newspaper, the National Intelligencer, intending to burn it down. However, several women persuaded him not to because they were afraid the fire would spread to their neighboring houses. Cockburn wanted to destroy the newspaper because its reporters had written so negatively about him, branding him "The Ruffian". Instead, he ordered his troops to tear the building down brick by brick, and ordered all the "C" type destroyed "so that the rascals can have no further means of abusing my name".[29] The US Treasury Building (built 1804) The Blodget Hotel which housed the US Patent Office; spared during the burning of Washington in 1814. The Patent Office later burned in 1836. The Washington Navy Yard in 1862 The British sought out the United States Treasury in hopes of finding money or items of worth, but they found only old records.[17] They burned the United States Treasury and other public buildings. The United States Department of War building was also burned. However, the War and State Department files had been removed, so the books and records had been saved; the only records of the War Department lost were recommendations of appointments for the Army and letters received from seven years earlier.[30] The First U.S. Patent Office Building was saved by the efforts of William Thornton, the former Architect of the Capitol and then the Superintendent of Patents, who gained British cooperation to preserve it.[31][A] "When the smoke cleared from the dreadful attack, the Patent Office was the only Government building ... left untouched" in Washington.[32] The Americans had already burned much of the historic Washington Navy Yard, founded by Thomas Jefferson, to prevent capture of stores and ammunition,[33] as well as the 44-gun frigate USS Columbia and the 22 gun USS Argus, both new vessels nearing completion.[34] The Navy Yard's Latrobe Gate, Quarters A, and Quarters B were the only buildings to escape destruction.[35][36] Also spared were the Marine Barracks and Commandant's House, although several private properties were damaged or destroyed.[37] In the afternoon of August 25, General Ross sent two hundred men to secure a fort on Greenleaf's Point. The fort, later known as Fort McNair, had already been destroyed by the Americans, but 150 barrels of gunpowder remained. While the British were trying to destroy it by dropping the barrels into a well, the powder ignited. As many as thirty men were killed in the explosion, and many others were maimed.[38] "The Storm that Saved Washington"[edit] Less than 4 days after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstorm—possibly a hurricane—put out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue[39] and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away and killing British troops and American civilians alike.[40] Following the storm, the British troops returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. There is some debate regarding the effect of this storm on the occupation. While some assert that the storm forced their retreat,[39] it seems likely from their destructive and arsonous actions before the storm, and their written orders from Cochrane to "destroy and lay waste",[41] that their intention was merely to raze the city, rather than occupy it for an extended period. Whatever the case, the British occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. Despite this, the "Storm that saved Washington", as it became known, did the opposite according to some. The rains sizzled and cracked the already charred walls of the White House and ripped away at structures the British had no plans to destroy (such as the Patent Office). The storm may have exacerbated an already dire situation for Washington D.C. An encounter was noted between Sir George Cockburn and a female resident of Washington. "Dear God! Is this the weather to which you are accustomed in this infernal country?" enquired the Admiral. "This is a special interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from our city", the woman allegedly called out to Cockburn. "Not so, Madam", Cockburn retorted. "It is rather to aid your enemies in the destruction of your city", before riding off on horseback.[42] Yet, the British left right after the storm completely unopposed by any American military forces. What makes this event even more serendipitous for the Americans is that, as the Smithsonian reports, there have only been seven other tornadoes recorded in Washington, D.C. in the 204 years since with probably a similar rare occurrence in the years prior to this event.[citation needed] The Royal Navy reported that it lost one man killed and six wounded in the attack, of whom the fatality and three of the wounded were from the Corps of Colonial Marines.[43] The destruction of the Capitol, including the Senate House and the House of Representatives, the Arsenal, Dockyard, Treasury, War Office, President's mansion, bridge over the Potomac, a frigate and a sloop together with all Materiel was estimated at £365,000.[12]:359 A separate British force captured Alexandria, on the south side of the Potomac River, while Ross's troops were leaving Washington. The mayor of Alexandria made a deal and the British refrained from burning the town.[44] President Madison returned to Washington by September 1, on which date he issued a proclamation calling on citizens to defend the District of Columbia.[45] Congress returned and assembled in special session on September 19. Due to the destruction of the Capitol and other public buildings, they initially met in the Post and Patent Office building.[46] In 2013, an episode of the Weather Channel documentary series When Weather Changed History, entitled "The Thunderstorm That Saved D.C.", was devoted to these events.[citation needed] Aftermath[edit] Most contemporary American observers, including newspapers representing anti-war Federalists, condemned the destruction of the public buildings as needless vandalism.[47] Many in the British public were shocked by the burning of the Capitol and other buildings at Washington; such actions were denounced by most leaders of continental Europe, where capital cities had been repeatedly occupied in the course of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars but always spared destruction (at least on the part of the occupiers – the famous burning of Moscow that occurred less than two years prior had been an act carried out by the defenders). According to The Annual Register, the burning had "brought a heavy censure on the British character", with some members of Parliament, including the anti-establishment MP Samuel Whitbread,[47] joining in the criticism. The majority of British opinion believed that the burnings were justified following the damage that United States forces had done with its incursions into Canada. In addition, they noted that the United States had been the aggressor, declaring war and initiating it.[48] Several commentators regarded the damages as just revenge for the American destruction of the Parliament buildings and other public buildings in York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, early in 1813. Sir George Prévost wrote that "as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate".[49] The Reverend John Strachan, who as Rector of York had witnessed the American acts there, wrote to Thomas Jefferson that the damage to Washington "was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada".[50] When they ultimately returned to Bermuda, the British forces took with them two pairs of portraits of King George III and his wife, Queen Charlotte, which had been discovered in one of the public buildings. One pair currently hangs in the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Bermuda, and the other in the Cabinet Building, both in the city of Hamilton.[51] Reconstruction[edit] The Old Brick Capitol serving as a prison during the Civil War Although the President and military officers returned to Washington only a few days after the British left, Congress did not return for three and half weeks.[52] The Thirteenth Congress officially convened on September 19, at the Blodgett's Hotel, one of the few surviving buildings large enough to hold all members.[53] The Blodgett's Hotel also housed the U.S. Patent Office. Although the British had destroyed all public buildings, the Blodgett's Hotel and U.S. Patent Office were spared.[54] It was in this building that Congress met between September and December 1815 (when construction of the Old Brick Capitol was complete).[55] There was a movement in Congress to relocate the capital after the burning. Congressmen from the North pushed for relocation to Philadelphia or other prominent northern cities, while Southern congressmen claimed that moving the capital would degrade the American sense of dignity and strength (however, many southern congressmen simply did not want to move the capital north of the Mason–Dixon line).[56] On September 21, the House of Representatives voted to strike down a proposal to relocate the capital from Washington, D.C. by a margin of 83 to 54.[57] On February 3, 1815, in an effort to guarantee that the federal government would always remain in the area, Washington property owners funded the building of the Old Brick Capitol,[58] a larger meeting space where the Supreme Court now stands.[59] Construction of the Old Brick Capitol cost $25,000 and was funded primarily through the sale of stocks. The largest donor was Daniel Carroll of Duddington, a rich English property owner in the area.[60] Construction began on July 4, and concluded in December. Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol between December 1815 and December 1819, when the Capitol reopened.[61] The Capitol reconstruction took much longer than anticipated. The Old Brick Capitol took only five months to complete; the Capitol took twelve years.[19] A committee appointed by Congress to investigate the damage to the District concluded that it was cheaper to rebuild the already existing and damaged buildings than to build an entirely new one.[62] On February 13, President Madison and Congress passed legislation to borrow $500,000 to repair the public buildings, including the Capitol, "on their present sites in the city of Washington".[63] Benjamin Latrobe, architect of the Capitol who took over for William Thornton in 1803, was rehired to repair the building on April 18.[64] He immediately requested 60,000 feet of boards, 500 tons of stone, 1,000 barrels of lime, and brick.[64] With the $500,000 borrowed from Washington banks,[61] Latrobe was able to rebuild the two wings and the central dome before being fired in 1818 for being difficult.[65] Charles Bulfinch took over and officially completed the renovations by 1826.[19] Bulfinch modified Latrobe's design by increasing the height of the Capitol dome to match the diameter of 86 ft. With the reconstruction of the public buildings in Washington, the value of land in the area increased dramatically, paving the way for the expansion of the city that developed in the years leading up to the American Civil War.[66] See also[edit] United States portal War of 1812 bibliography Notes[edit] ^ Brief History of the United States Patent Office from its foundation—1790 to 1886—with an outline of laws, growth, publications, office routine, etc. Washington, D.C.: R.

Thornton "put himself before the gun, and in a frenzy of excitement exclaimed: 'Are you Englishmen or only Goths and Vandals? This is the Patent Office, a depository of the ingenuity of the American nation, in which the whole civilized world is interested. Would you destroy it? If so, fire away, and let the charge pass through my body.' The effect is said to have been magical upon the soldiers, and to have saved the Patent Office from destruction."

Since October 2000, the country has worked to stabilize and strengthen its bilateral relationships with neighboring countries. In spring and summer 2002, Yugoslavia resolved its longstanding border dispute with Republic of Macedonia and established full diplomatic relations with its neighbor and former adversary Croatia. Although a difficult political issue domestically, Serbia has established a solid working relationship with UNMIK and has released all disputed ethnic Albanian prisoners from Kosovo to the competent UN bodies. In 2002, the government established a commission to coordinate cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and began serving warrants for the arrest of indicted war criminals who have sought refuge in the country. The crackdown on organized crime following the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić; also resulted in the apprehension and transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Hague of several persons indicted for war crimes. Immediately preceding the NATO bombing campaign of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in spring 1999, the U.S. and most European countries severed relations with Yugoslavia, and the U.S. embassy was closed. Since October 5, 2000, foreign embassies, including that of the U.S., have reopened, and the country has regained its seat in such international organizations as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations and is actively participating in International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank projects. As of summer 2003, Serbia and Montenegro has been admitted to the Council of Europe and has indicated that it wishes to join NATO's Partnership for Peace. Contents 1 Foreign aid 2 International disputes 3 Illicit drugs 4 See also Foreign aid[edit] Subsequent to the outbreak of hostilities with NATO, Belgrade received no foreign aid from the United States and other west European countries, but has received much aid from other countries such as Russia, China, and Greece. Since October 2000, however, the European Union aid has steadily increased, and U.S. restrictions on aid have fallen away as the union of Serbia and Montenegro stepped forward to meet its international obligations. In June 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was able to certify that Serbia and Montenegro relationship with the Republika Srpska was consistent with the Dayton Accords, had released all political prisoners, and was cooperating with ICTY. As a result, the United States is now free to release aid money and support Serbia and Montenegro in international financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank. Total U.S. aid to Serbia and Montenegro, including debt forgiveness, exceeded $180 million in fiscal year 2002. The U.S. is the single-largest donor of aid to Serbia and Montenegro. International disputes[edit] Several Albanian political parties in Kosovo voice union with Albania Has delimited about half of the boundary with Bosnia and Herzegovina, but sections along the Drina River remain in dispute. There is also a dispute with Bosnia regarding the exclave of Sastavci village in Priboj municipality (which is entirely surrounded by Serbian territory), as well as Serbian "practical" exclave comprising several villages in the same area. Some disputes with Croatia regarding the border. In 2002 there was a border incident regarding river island near Šarengrad, when Serbian border police prevented land owners from Croatia to visit their properties (lying in Serbian territory) using boats. In late 2002, Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia adopted an interim agreement to settle the disputed Prevlaka Peninsula, allowing the withdrawal of the UN monitoring mission (UNMOP), but discussions could be complicated by the inability of Serbia and Montenegro to come to an agreement on the economic aspects of the new federal union. After a recent shooting of an Albanian youth crossing the border with Macedonia there has been calls for autonomy for Albanians in the Presevo region, having international troops put as borderguards, and making of more border crossings.

N verify (what is YN ?) Infobox references Manganese(III) fluoride (also known as Manganese trifluoride) is the inorganic compound with the formula MnF3. This red/purplish solid is useful for converting hydrocarbons into fluorocarbons, i.e., it is a fluorination agent.[1] It forms a hydrate and many derivatives. Contents 1 Synthesis, structure and reactions 1.1 Structure 1.2 Reactions 2 See also 3 References 3.1 Further reading 4 External links Synthesis, structure and reactions[edit] MnF3 can be prepared by treating a solution of MnF2 in hydrogen fluoride with fluorine:[2] MnF2 + 0.5 F2 → MnF3 It can also be prepared by the reaction of elemental fluorine with a manganese(II) halide at ~250 °C.[3] Structure[edit] Like vanadium(III) fluoride, MnF3 features octahedral metal centers with the same average M-F bond distances. In the Mn compound, however, is distorted (and hence a monoclinic unit cell vs. a higher symmetry one) due to the Jahn-Teller effect, with pairs of Mn-F distances of 1.79, 1.91, 2.09 Å.[4][5][6] The hydrate MnF3.3H2O is obtained by crystallisation of MnF3 from hydrofluoric acid. The hydrate exists as two polymorphs, with space groups P21/c and P21/a. Each consists of the salt [Mn(H2O)4F2]+[Mn(H2O)2F4]− ).[7] Reactions[edit] MnF3 is Lewis acidic and forms a variety of derivatives. One example is K2MnF3(SO4).[8] MnF3 reacts with sodium fluoride to give the octahedral hexafluoride:[3] 3NaF + MnF3 → Na3MnF6 Related reactions salts of the anions MnF52− or MnF4−. These anions adopt chain and layer structures respectively, with bridging fluoride. Manganese remains 6 coordinate, octahedral, and trivalent in all of these materials.[3] Manganese(III) fluoride fluorinates organic compounds including aromatic hydrocarbons,[9] cyclobutenes,[10] and fullerenes.[11] On heating, MnF3 decomposes to manganese(II) fluoride.[12][13] See also[edit] CoF3, another fluorinating agent based on a transition metal in an oxidising +3 state.

The Workers' Party of Belgium (Dutch: Partij van de Arbeid van België, PVDA; French: Parti du Travail de Belgique, PTB; stylized as PVDA+/PTB-GO!) is a Marxist political party in Belgium that operates as a single Belgian party, in contrast to all other major Belgian political parties, which are either Flemish, Francophone or local. The PTB-PVDA used to host the International Communist Seminar until 2014 which had become one of the main worldwide gatherings of communist parties. PTB-PVDA has traditionally been a small party, but since the mid-2010s has gained momentum and increasing popularity at the polls and elections, particularly in Wallonia and working-class communities in Brussels.[14][15][16] Contents 1 History 2 Recent developments 3 Controversies 3.1 Stalinism 3.2 Party of the Automobile 4 Electoral results 4.1 Federal Parliament 4.2 Regional parliaments 4.2.1 Brussels Parliament 4.2.2 Flemish Parliament 4.2.3 Walloon Parliament 4.3 European Parliament 5 Elected politicians 6 References 7 External links History[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Workers' Party of Belgium originated in the student movement at the end of the 1960s. Students (organized in the student union SVB - Studenten VakBeweging), mainly from the Catholic University of Leuven, turned towards the working-class movement. They considered the politics of the existing Communist Party of Belgium revisionist, i.e. too much turned toward social-democratic politics (represented in Belgium by the Belgian Socialist Party). They were influenced by the ideas of the Communist Party of China, guerrilla movements in Latin America, the movement against the Vietnam War, and the Leuven-Vlaams movement, all perceived as aspects of a worldwide struggle against colonial or neo-colonial oppression and for civil or workers' rights. Their support and participation in an important strike in the coalmines turned the movement into a political party. They founded a periodical, AMADA (Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders - All Power To The Workers), which became the first name of their party. In 1979 the first congress was held, which adopted a Maoist programme and changed the name into PVDA-PTB. Ludo Martens became the first president, and remained an important ideologist of the party until his death in 2011. Recent developments[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Following its electoral defeat in 2003, the PVDA-PTB fundamentally changed its working methods and communication. On one hand, the PVDA-PTB said it would refocus on working with factory workers as well as on field work in the communities where it operates. On the other hand, the PVDA-PTB said it would officially break with what it calls its sectarian past to get closer to the concrete demands of citizens. This is reflected particularly by the demands put forward on very concrete issues, e.g. lower prices for medication, the reduction of VAT on energy products from 21% to 6%, an increase of the minimum pension, better control of rents or the lower cost of trash bags. In preparation for the Belgian elections of June 2007, the Solidarity newspaper and the website of the party were merged in order to reach a wider public. The structures have also been "open" to a broader layer of activists. On 2 March 2008, the work of the Eighth Congress of the PVDA-PTB was completed with a closing meeting at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. This Congress was conducted with the theme of "party renewal." A new Central Committee was elected, which in turn elected a new Bureau of the Party. It consists of: Peter Mertens, °1969. President Lydia Neufcourt, °1955. Responsible for expanding the party Raoul Hedebouw, °1977. National voice of the PVDA-PTB Joris Van Gorp, °1952. Head of union relations Jo Cottenier, °1947. Responsible for the socio-economic issues Baudouin Deckers, °1946. Head of International Relations. Tom De Meester, °1975. Energy. David Pestieau, °1969. Editor of Solidarity. Workers Party of Belgium Campaign in Brussels, 2008 This 'shift' seems to have produced some positive results, such as an increase in membership and a rebound of the electoral score of the PVDA-PTB in recent elections. The last elections in May 2019 showed more progress: a breakthrough was realised at the Flemish and European level. Since 2018 the party is also represented in the municipal councils of larger cities in Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels. In September 2014 the party had more than 8,000 members, in 2020 the number had grown to 20,000. Its monthly publication "Solidarity / Solidarity" has between 3,000 and 5,000 subscribers. COMAC, its youth movement, is active in all the universities in Belgium and in secondary schools (in Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels). The PVDA-PTB is also known for its 11 Medicine for the people medical centres,[17] which provide free access to primary health care. The newspaper Solidarity, and Medicine for the People organize "ManiFiesta", a yearly festival of solidarity between the communities and the left in Belgium. The first edition was held in Bredene (by the sea) on 25 September 2010 and brought together 6,000 people from both North and South of Belgium. The fourth edition in 2013 attracted 10,000 people.[18] Controversies[edit] Stalinism[edit] The PTB continues to be perceived as Stalinist, in relation to the Stalin hagiography written by its past-president Ludo Martens. Current president Peter Mertens tries to get his party out of this deep-rooted paradigm.[19] Party of the Automobile[edit] Despite its recent conversion to ecology,[20] local WPB sections oppose any restriction related to private car use, what has led to the nickname Party of the Automobile (Partij Van De Auto in Dutch):[21][22] In Antwerp against the Low Emissions zone in the city centre[23] In Liège against fines for illegal parking on sidewalks In Schaerbeek against parking tariffs[24] Electoral results[edit] The general elections of 2007 saw the party obtaining 0.88% in the Flemish electoral district and 0.81% in Wallonia. In the regional elections in 2009 the PVDA-PTB gained 1.04% of the vote in Flanders (+0.48%) and 1.24% of the vote in Wallonia (+0.62%). For the European elections on the same day the results were: 0.98% in the Dutch-speaking electoral college (+0.37%) and 1.16% in the French-speaking electoral college (+0.35%). In the general elections of June 2010 the party saw further growth. In Flanders it now represents 1.3% (+0.4%) of the votes for the Chamber of Representatives and 1.4% (+0.5%) for the Senate. Especially in the cities progress was noted with high scores in Antwerp (4.1%) and Liège (4.2%). The highest scores were gained in the cantons of Herstal (9.8%), Assenede (7.5%) and Seraing (7.3%); all places where the PVDA-PTB traditionally is strong. The municipal and provincial elections in 2012 were considered a breakthrough on a local level for the PVDA-PTB. The party won 52 seats in total; 31 in municipal councils, 4 in provincial councils, and 17 in the district councils. The federal and regional elections in 2014 saw further success for the party. They elected two deputies to the Chamber of Representatives,[25] two others to the Walloon Parliament,[26] and finally four to the Brussels Parliament.[27] Previous logo of the Workers' Party, showing the party's previous slogan which translates to "People Before Profit". An opinion poll released in July 2017 suggested the party was the most popular party in Wallonia at the time, with 25% of respondents indicating they intended to vote for the party. The second-most popular party was the Mouvement Réformateur, part of the governing coalition, with 23%. The poll indicated that the Workers' Party would win 26 seats in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives if the next federal election were held immediately, putting it in tied first place with the Flemish N-VA.[28] The party generally increased its vote share in the 2018 local elections, and won over 15% of the vote in several French-speaking cities.[29] In the 2019 Belgian federal election, the party scored well and gained 10 seats.[30] The party did well in Wallonia (13.8% overall there), scoring over 16% in Liège Province, over 15% in Hainaut Province, and also over 12% in Brussels-Capital Region.[31] It achieved at least 22% of the votes in both Charleroi and La Louvière cities. Its strongest showing in Flanders was 12.71% in Antwerp city.[32] The PTB was also the fourth largest party in the European election the same day in the Francophone areas, winning 14.59% and giving it one seat.[33] Federal Parliament[edit] Chamber of Representatives (Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers/Chambre des Représentants/Abgeordnetenkammer) Election year # ofoverall votes % ofoverall vote % of languagegroup vote # ofoverall seats won # of languagegroup seats won +/– Government 1991 30,491 0.5 0 / 212 in extraparliamentary opposition 1995 34,247 0 / 150 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 1999 30,930 0 / 150 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2003 20,825 0.2 0 / 150 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2007 56,167 0.8 0 / 150 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2010 101,088 1.6 0 / 150 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2014 251,289 3.72 2 / 150 2 in opposition 2019 584,458 8.6 12 / 150 10 in opposition Senate (Senaat/Sénat/Senat) Election year # ofoverall votes % ofoverall vote % of languagegroup vote # ofoverall seats won # of languagegroup seats won +/– Government 2003 18,699 0.1 0 / 40 in extraparliamentary opposition 2007 54,807 0.8 0 / 40 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2010 105,060 1.6 0 / 40 0 in extraparliamentary opposition Regional parliaments[edit] Brussels Parliament[edit] Election year # ofoverall votes % ofoverall vote % of languagegroup vote # ofoverall seats won # of languagegroup seats won +/– Government 2004 2,221 0.6 0 / 89 in extraparliamentary opposition 2009 4,038 0.9 0 / 89 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2014 15,782 3.86 4 / 89 4 in opposition 2019 55,289 13.47 11 / 89 7 in opposition Flemish Parliament[edit] Election year # ofoverall votes % ofoverall vote % of languagegroup vote # ofoverall seats won # of languagegroup seats won +/– Government 2004 22,874 0.6 0 / 124 in extraparliamentary opposition 2009 42,849 1.04 0 / 124 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2014 106,114 2.53 0 / 124 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2019 225,593 5.32 (#7) 4 / 124 4 in opposition Walloon Parliament[edit] Election year # ofoverall votes % ofoverall vote % of languagegroup vote # ofoverall seats won # of languagegroup seats won +/– Government 2004 12,216 0.6 0 / 75 in extraparliamentary opposition 2009 24,875 1.24 0 / 75 0 in extraparliamentary opposition 2014 117,500 5.75 2 / 75 2 in opposition 2019 278,343 13.68 10 / 75 8 in opposition European Parliament[edit] Election year # ofoverall votes % ofoverall vote % of languagegroup vote # ofoverall seats won # of languagegroup seats won +/– 1984 43,637 0.76 0 / 24 1989 29,778 0.50 0 / 24 0 1994 59,270 0.99 0 / 25 0 1999[34] 22,038 0.35 0 / 25 0 2004 44,452 0.7 0 / 24 0 2009 68,540 1.04 0 / 22 0 2014 234,718 3.51 0 / 22 0 2019 566,274 8.42 1 / 21 1 Elected politicians[edit] European deputies 2019 – 2024: Marc Botenga Federal deputies 2019 – 2024: Nabil Boukili Gaby Colebunders Roberto D'Amico Greet Daems Steven De Vuyst Raoul Hedebouw Sofie Merckx Peter Mertens Nadia Moscufo Marco Van Hees Maria Vindevoghel Thierry Warmoes Regional deputies 2019 – 2024: Brussels Jan Busselen Francis Dagrin Caroline De Bock Françoise De Smedt Elisa Groppi Youssef Handichi Jean-Pierre Kerckhofs Stéphanie Koplowicz Leila Lahssaini Petya Obolensky Luc Vancauwenberghe Flanders Jos D'Haese Tom De Meester Kim De Witte Lise Vandecasteele Wallonia Alice Bernard John Beugnies Jori Dupont Antoine Hermant Laure Lekane Julien Liradelfo Germain Mugemangango Samuel Nemes Amandine Pavet Anouk Vandevoorde Provincial councilors 2018 – 2024: Catharina Craen Giovanni Dell'Area Marc Delrez Catherine Lacomble Luc Navet Rafik Rassâa Marie-Christine Scheen Rudy Sohier Luc Vandenameele Patricia Van Muylder References[edit] ^ "Our DNA".

Contents 1 Physical geography 2 Inhabitants 3 Ancient sites 4 Specialty products 5 Bibliography 6 References Physical geography[edit] The Tektek Mountains are located on the northern border of the Urfa-Harran plain, between the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.[4][5] Reaching an altitude of 801 meters (2,628 ft), this spur extends southward from the Tur Abdin mountain range about 30 kilometers (19 mi) away.[2][4] The Şebeke Mountains to the west form a chain together with the Tektek and Susuz Mountains. The Viranşehir plain, which covers an area of 1,200 square kilometers (460 sq mi), lies between the Tektek and Karacadağ Mountains.[4] The mountain range is composed of Eocene and Miocene limestone, its valleys formed in the humid climatic conditions characteristic of the interglacial and post-glacial periods. There is no basalt present. The Tektek Mountains are devoid of woodland, with the exception of an area at the northwest end of the range where pistachio (pistacia khinjuk) trees grow.[3] Inhabitants[edit] Villages in the Tektek Mountains are inhabited by semi-nomadic pastoralists and agriculturalists of uncertain origin whose housing is constructed low to the ground, and sometimes within it, using the mud upon which they are situated. Crops can be grown in the spring, but the summer heat drives away most of inhabitants, many of whom graze their livestock elsewhere at that time of the year.[1] Nomadic families from the Karacadağ Mountain come to the Tektek Mountains for the autumn and winter seasons to graze their animals and hunt wild game.[3] Near a hill known as Keçili Tepe, there is a small village of the same name.[3] Ancient sites[edit] The two ancient sites located in the Tektek Mountains are Karahan Tepe, some 63 kilometers (39 mi) east of Urfa, and Sumatar Harabesi, some 60 kilometers (37 mi) from the same.[3] Sumatar Harabesi is an oasis that served as an ancient watering hole for semi-nomadic peoples, as well as a sacred site with baetyls and altars dedicated to the worship of the deity, Sin. Karahan Tepe is a site that was discovered in 1997 and was dated to c. 9500–9000 BC by Bahattin Çelik, a Turkish archaeologist. Covering an area of 325,000 square metres (3,500,000 sq ft), it consists of a number of stone T-pillars and high reliefs depicting, among other images, a winding snake and the battered torso of a naked man.[3] There are also polished rock statues of goats, gazelles and rabbits. Specialty products[edit] The butter used in Baklavacı Güllüoğlu, baklava made by a company founded by the Güllü brothers in 1871, is made from milk taken from sheep and goats in the Tektek Mountains. The butter is on average five times more expensive than the margarine used by other baklava producers, costing some US$15 per kilo.[6] Bibliography[edit] The World Almanac & Book of Facts.

It is an allegory about good and evil, the conflict between mankind's creative and destructive urges, the power of love, and the joy to be found in simple pleasures. Dude is an Everyman who loses his innocence and fights to regain it. Contents 1 Background 2 Production 3 Synopsis 4 Song list 5 Notes 6 References 7 External links Background[edit] As soon as the musical Hair opened, Ragni began to work on Dude. MacDermot was busy with Two Gentlemen of Verona but finally began to compose the music. In March 1972, their studio cast album, Salome Bey Sings Songs from Dude, was recorded and released on Kilmarnock Records. The music was more influenced by country music than their previous musical, Hair.[1] The rehearsal period was plagued with problems: Kevin Geer, the actor who had been cast in the leading role, Dude, was unable to sing the role acceptably and had to be replaced; the script (such as it was) was far from finished; Ragni's requests of the producers were bizarre (for example, 100 butterflies to be released at the beginning of each performance); and the cast threatened to walk out.[2] Production[edit] In The Broadway Theatre, the musicians were divided, with brass and woodwinds against the wall of one side of the playing area and strings at the other. To accommodate the multimedia presentation, the theatre was gutted and reconverted, at a cost of $800,000, into a circus-like arena in the center (a theatre in the round) filled with fake dirt (real dirt had caused dust; wetting it had caused mud), ramps, runways, catwalks, columns, trapezes, trapdoors, bleachers, and various mechanical and electronic gear. Performers moved freely between the round playing area, representing "Earth", and the audience, seated in flanking "valleys and foothills," with "mountains and mountain tops" beyond and "tree tops and trees" (mezzanine) above. "Heaven and hell" were also represented. The overall effect was of a circus being performed in a primeval forest.[2] The previews were disastrous, as the audience could not hear with the orchestra scattered around the edges of the theatre. Despite attempts at amplification, the acoustics were still bad in the hollowed out theatre. The director and choreographer resigned, to be replaced by Tom O'Horgan, who had directed Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar. Previews were shut down, and the show went back into rehearsal. Some cast changes were made, and flamboyant visual effects were added. The director and cast confronted Ragni and forced him to rewrite scenes, including most of the second act. Actors wrote some of their own dialogue. The script finally settled down, mostly, by the second to last preview.[2] After sixteen previews, the Broadway production, directed by Tom O'Horgan, opened on October 9, 1972 at The Broadway Theatre. Universally crucified by the critics (and audiences), who found it incomprehensible, it ran for only 16 performances. The cast included Nell Carter, Rae Allen, Salome Bey, and Ralph Carter, who won the Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Performer. Ralph Carter, an 11-year-old African-American, replaced Kevin Geer, a white 23-year-old, who was originally slated to play "Dude". Due to Carter's age, Nat Morris was cast as "Big Dude" in order to still use the more mature songs.[3] Despite leaving the show, Geer's image, with his back facing the camera was used for the show's poster.[4] Only five weeks after Dude closed, MacDermot experienced another major failure with the flop musical Via Galactica. Synopsis[edit] Reba and Harold, actors who believe they have been cast in Richard III, instead find themselves portraying Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden-like setting, where they are tempted by Zero (the devil) and give birth to son Dude. The forces of Good (#33, Bread, Susie Moon, Mother Earth, and the Shubert Angels) and Evil (Zero, Nero, Esso, Extra, and Sissy) try to gain control of Dude's soul. Dude grows up and succumbs to the temptations of bizarre sexual practices and illicit drugs, leaving his parents guilt-ridden, until Guide #33 (God) assures them that life is merely show business and everything has a happy ending.

Adult frog on the edge of a drinking glass. Description[edit] Roth's tree frog is a medium-sized frog, reaching a maximum length of 5.7 cm (2.2 in). The body is elongated, with a small head and large eyes. It is an arboreal frog, and its toe pads are wider than its fingers. The dorsal surface is a dull grey to brown colour, and can be blotched with dark brown. The inner thighs and armpits are black and blotched with bright yellow or orange. The tympanum is visible, with a fold of skin covering the top portion. A dark Roth's tree frog with red patches There are two features which distinguish it from both Perons' tree frog and Tyler's tree frog - the upper half of the iris is deep red, and it has no emerald green flecks on the dorsal surface. Ecology and behaviour[edit] Roth's tree frog breeds during the wet season, from November to March. The call is seven to 9 loud, chuckling or cackling sounds that resemble laughter. Eggs are laid in temporary pools of water, and the tadpoles take a maximum of 65 days to metamorphose. The colour of Roth's tree frog is extremely variable, and can change from pale grey to dark brown within hours. Typically, they are grey during the day whilst basking in the sun, and are brown at night.

Contents 1 Plot 1.1 Citation 2 About the film 3 Cast 4 References 5 External links Plot[edit] Tsatsiki's girlfriend Maria suddenly brakes their relationship; she "doesn't believe something about love", and hates Tsatsiki's flowers because "krukväxter ger man bara till gamlingar" ("houseplants you should only give to old people"). A few days later his best friend Per Hammar also leaves Tsatsiki, because Tsatsiki made him unlucky with saying to Maria that "han kissar i sängen" ("he pees in the bed"). Later Tsatsiki, "Morsan" and Göran will travel to Greece where Tsatsiki's father, grandfather and cousin Elena live. A few days before the journey he goes to Maria who lost her pen box at school, and tells her that Göran and Niclas said that the flowers were a "love gesture", but she doesn't believe it and says that he can "go to Greece and after that tell her what love is if he can learn about love there". But when they're going it comes problems; Niclas says that he, "Morsan" and their rock group will go for a concert tour to Japan, but soon Tsatsiki allows "Morsan" to go and instead he lets Grandpa ("Morfar") go with him to Greece, where Tsatsiki's paternal grandfather who is terminally ill ("Farfar") and Elena tells him what love is. Before his paternal grandfather dies he shows Tsatsiki and grandfather the place where he first met Tsatsiki's grandmother who was a member of the greek resistance like him during World War II they fought for the freedom against the Germans. When he comes back home, he goes to Per and apologizes and they go, together with Göran, to Strömmen where it's a fishing competition which Tsatsiki and Per planned before Tsatsiki made him unlucky. Later he goes to Maria and tells her that he learnt about love in Greece and she loves him again. Now he understands that the most alone person on the whole Earth is he/she who doesn't have any friend. Citation[edit] (Tsatsiki) Morfar, vet du vad jag tycker är viktigast? – Att ha en kompis.

It was taken from their 1984 album Forever Young. The single was a success in many countries, including Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. It was also the group's only UK Top 75 hit, reaching No. 8 on the UK Singles chart. The song also reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Play in December 1984.

The timing of the song was influenced by "The Safety Dance", changing the speed to double-time, halfway through the song. The melody was developed by all three members of the band, working in their provincial home studio.[2] Marian Gold developed most of the lyrics while going to a dentist. The theme was based on two friends who were involved in the sordid drug scene of Berlin's Zoo station. The song tells of such lovers who fantasize about being drug-free. The refrain "big in Japan" symbolises this idea of being successful in another world.That line has a certain meaning. It means that if you're a complete loser, you're telling other people, 'I'm not a loser because in Japan I'm really big.' It's the lie of the loser and it fitted perfectly into the story of these junkies, which the song is about, in a very tragic way.[2]— Marian Gold The phrase was inspired by the name of the real band, Big in Japan, whose album Gold had recently bought.As you know, there's a considerable musical market in Japan. If you wanted to become famous, what you should do was to form a hard rock group and then release an album over there; it would definitely sell well... so the story went ...[3]— Marian Gold Later, when the song was reaching the top of the German charts, the number one song which had to be displaced was "Relax" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood whose lead singer, Holly Johnson, had formerly been in Big in Japan – a remarkable coincidence, according to Gold.[2] The video was directed by Yello's Dieter Meier.

As the sea receded southwards, in the sub-recent geological period, a large low-lying plain got exposed. Both tidal inflows and the rivers have been depositing sediments in this plain. The periodical collapse of both the natural levees and man-made embankments speed up the process of filling up of the depressions containing brackish water wetlands. The marine delta in the south is formed of interlacing tidal channels. As non-saline water for irrigation is scarce, agriculture is monsoon dominated. Some parts of the wetlands are still preserved for raising fish.[6] Kulpi CD block has an area of 210.83 km2.

(September 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Samuel Jarvis (December 27, 1720 – September 1, 1780) was the father of William Jarvis, head of the Jarvis family in what is now Toronto, Ontario. Life and career[edit] Jarvis was born in Stamford, Connecticut, to Captain Samuel Jarvis, an American Loyalist, and Naomi Griffin. Jarvis served as long-time town clerk of Stamford, and he was forced to resign due to his loyalty to the British in 1760[dubious – discuss]. After fleeing Connecticut, Jarvis joined the British Army and became a brigadier general, commanding a Loyalist regiment. Captured and imprisoned in 1778, Jarvis was freed, but he was no longer useful to the British. He later fled with wife Martha Seymour and some of his family to Saint John, New Brunswick. Out of work and with no pension for his military service, Jarvis became a surveyor and searcher. He died in 1780 in Saint John, New Brunswick.

Born in Kiel when it was in the Danish Duchy of Holstein, he and his family were displaced when Marshall Davoust, Napoleon's "Iron Marshall," occupied the family home as his headquarters. Allhusen was employed by Koch & Sons, grain merchants of Rostock and then moved to Newcastle, where he was employed by Campbell & Reveley, also grain merchants.[1] Allhusen became a British citizen by a private Act of Parliament.[2] He later went into partnership with Henry Bolckow and expanded into the ship and insurance brokerage business.[1][3][4] In 1840, Allhusen purchased a soap works in Gateshead, and began the manufacture of chemicals, eventually calling the company C. Allhusen & Sons. In 1871, Allhusen converted his enterprise into a joint-stock company, Newcastle Chemical Works, Ltd. He made a large fortune, and was influential in the region as company director and shareholder in such companies as the Northumberland & Durham District Bank, the Newcastle & Gates Water Company and the Consett Iron Works. He was an active member of the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce and the Tyne Commission.[1] In 1854, Allhusen was among local industrialists urging construction of a new quay for Gateshead. When the quay was eventually constructed, the local government failed to include necessary transportation facilities to allow efficient transport to and from the quay facility. As a result, the quay complex required years of subsidies and struggled to avoid failure as Allhusen had predicted.[5] Allhusen died on 13 January 1890 at Stoke Court, Buckinghamshire.[6] References[edit] ^ a b c John Fenwick Allen (1906).

(December 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Old town Kettwig is the southernmost borough of the city of Essen in western Germany and, until 1975, was a town in its own right. Kettwig is situated next to the Ruhr river, at a median height of 53 metres above sea level. It is the most recently incorporated borough of Essen and also the largest in area, at 15.3 km². It belongs to the city district Stadtbezirk IX Werden/Kettwig/Bredeney and has 17,760 inhabitants as of June 2006.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Sights 3 List of mayors 4 Transport 5 Trivia 6 References 7 External links History[edit] Map of Kettwig, 1640 Kettwig's first mention was in a letter of Pope Innocent III to Heribert II of Werden dated May 19, 1199.[2] A bridge over the Ruhr was first mentioned in 1282 and heavily fought for during the Thirty Years War. The northern parts of the Kettwig parish belonged to the abbey of Werden until 1802, then fell to Prussia from 1802 to 1806. From 1806 to 1814, Kettwig belonged to the earldom of Berg, then was under Prussian administration again until 1929. Kettwig gained town rights in 1857 and first belonged to the district of Duisburg, then to the district of Essen. In 1929, when the district of Essen was dissolved, Kettwig fell to the district Düsseldorf-Mettmann. The part of Kettwig south of the Ruhr, Kettwig vor der Brücke, belonged to the earldom of Berg until 1814, then fell to the district of Düsseldorf until May 15, 1930 when it was merged with Kettwig. Oefte was merged from Heiligenhaus into Kettwig in April 1936. On January 1, 1975, the district reform in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia became effective and Kettwig was separated from the Düsseldorf-Mettmann district (which was renamed to Mettmann), and merged into the city of Essen.[3] The westernmost part of Kettwig, Mintard, merged into Mülheim an der Ruhr. In 1996, a public quorum demanded Kettwig to be split off the city of Essen and to be merged back into the district of Mettmann, however, the state government decided not to change the status quo. Sights[edit] Kettwig reservoir Thanks to not having any important major industries, Kettwig emerged from World War II largely unscathed and with most of its medieval old town still intact. The tower of the Market Church dates back to the 14th century, with additions from 1720. The Catholic Church St. Peter was christened in 1830. Other sights include Schloss Hugenpoet, which has been remodeled into a hotel, Schloss Oefte, and the Kattenturm, a 14th-century watchtower belonging to the former castle Luttelnau. The Kettwig reservoir was built by the Ruhrverband between 1940 and 1950. It is the smallest of the five Ruhr reservoirs. It holds up to 1.42 million m³ of water and powers a hydroelectric power plant with a maximum output of 5.3 MW, built for and operated by RWE.

There are two railway stops on Kettwig territory, both are served by the S6 line of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn since May 1968. Kettwig railway station is situated on the northern side of the Ruhr and dates back to the 1870s, whilst Kettwig Stausee railway station opened in 1945 after the destruction of the rail bridges over the Ruhr, serving Kettwig vor der Brücke. The latter used to connect to lines leading to Mülheim an der Ruhr and Velbert, but these have been closed in the 1960s. Local bus lines are operated by Ruhrbahn. The Rheinbahn now operates the former Bahnbus lines to Mülheim an der Ruhr and Düsseldorf. Trivia[edit] Due to being integrated into Essen relatively recently, there are a few quirks associated with Kettwig: The telephone dialling code is 02054, despite the rest of Essen having the 0201 code. The railway stations have not been prefixed with Essen-, as has been the case with all other stations in Essen. Kettwig belongs to the diocese of Cologne, which results in the Ruhr diocese not profiting from Kettwig church taxes. The Protestant population (about 58%) likewise belongs to the church parish of Mülheim an der Ruhr. References[edit] ^ "Bevölkerung am Ort der Hauptwohnung" (PDF).

This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase (decarboxylating). This enzyme participates in purine metabolism. Structural studies[edit] As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes 1XSQ, 1XSR, 1YQC, and 2BDR.

(2017–2020)Ecology Democracy Solidarity (2020 onwards) Martine Wonner (born 27 March 1964) is a French psychiatrist[1] and politician who has been serving as a member of the French National Assembly since the 2017 elections, representing the 4th constituency of the department of Bas-Rhin.[2]. She was elected as a member of La République En Marche! (LREM), but left and in May 2020 was one of the original 17 members of the new Ecology Democracy Solidarity group. Contents 1 Education and early career 2 Political career 3 Political positions 3.1 Foreign policy 3.2 Domestic policy 4 See also 5 References Education and early career[edit] Wonner graduated in psychiatric medicine from the University of Strasbourg. She began her career as a medical consultant for the Agence Régionale de l'Hospitalisation of Lorraine and Alsace and then joined the private group Ramsay Générale de Santé in 2006. She then worked as a psychiatrist in a specialised clinic, before taking up managerial positions, first for SAMU Social and then for the private medical group Sinoué.[3]. Political career[edit] In parliament, Wonner serves on the Committee on Social Affairs.[4] In addition to her role in parliament, she has been serving as a member of the French delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe since 2017. She is a member of the Sub-Committee on Children.[5] She left LREM in May 2020[6] and was one of the 17 initial members of the new Ecology Democracy Solidarity group in the National Assembly. Political positions[edit] Foreign policy[edit] In April 2018, Wonner joined other co-signatories around Sébastien Nadot in officially filing a request for a commission of inquiry into the legality of French weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, days before an official visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Paris.[7] In July 2019, Wonner decided not to align with her parliamentary group’s majority and became one of 52 LREM members who abstained from a vote on the French ratification of the European Union’s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada.[8] Domestic policy[edit] In May 2018, Wonner co-sponsored an initiative in favour of a bioethics law extending to homosexual and single women free access to fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) under France's national health insurance; it was one of the campaign promises of President Emmanuel Macron and marked the first major social reform of his five-year term.[9][10] On immigration, Wonner is considered to be part of her parliamentary group's more liberal wing. In late 2019, she was among the critics of the government's legislative proposals on immigrations and instead joined 17 LREM members who recommended, in particular, greater access to the labour market for migrants, but also "specific measures for collaboration with the authorities of safe countries, such as Albania and Georgia, in order to inform candidates for departure, in their country of origin, of what the asylum application really is."[11] During the COVID-19 pandemic in France, Wonner joined Philippe Douste-Blazy in expressing criticism of how the government of Prime Minister Édouard Philippe handled its response and called for easing the conditions for the use of hydroxychloroquine.[12][13] See also[edit] 2017 French legislative election References[edit] ^ Caroline Vigoureux (6 April 2020), Martine Wonner (LREM): «Je m’interroge sur la confiance à apporter au gouvernement sur cette gestion de crise» L'Opinion. ^ "Elections législatives 2017".

He first sailed at the age of 8.[2] Career[edit] Hinterhoeller apprenticed and developed his trade as a master boat builder before eventually emigrating to Canada in 1952, where he was employed building powerboats at Shepherd Boats in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. He designed and built sailboats in his spare time. By 1956 he was taking numerous orders for the Y-Flyer one-design. He built 40 before “the market dried up.”[3] In 1959, Hinterhoeller built a 22-foot plywood sloop called TEETER-TOTTER, which he hoped would "go like hell when the wind blew". It did exactly that, and there was demand from others to buy copies of the racer. He increased the design by two feet and called the new boat the Shark 24. Though the first few were plywood, an early customer insisted his be built with fiberglass and the design was changed to the cheaper material, helping to spur the growth of sailboats for "the masses".[4][5] In 1969, Hinterhoeller merged his operation with three other companies: Belleville Marine Yard, Bruckmann Manufacturing, and the design partnership of George Cuthbertson and George Cassian, to form C&C Yachts. Hinterhoeller was in charge of "production shop" and Bruckmann the "custom shop". The new company took over manufacturing of the Shark 24 along with numerous other new designs including the very popular C&C 27. Hinterhoeller left C&C in 1976, and refounded Hinterhoeller Yachts which created, among other designs, popular series of catboat called the Nonsuch, of which there are nearly 1000 in existence. Death[edit] George Hinterhoeller died of a heart attack in Niagara-on-the-Lake on March 18, 1999, at age 71.[5] His legacy lives on primarily in thousands of sailboats. The largest number of any one design is the Shark, of which there are more than 2500 vessels primarily in the Great Lakes region and in Europe.[4] Awards[edit] George Hinterhoeller was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Brock University or his contributions to "sailing, yacht construction and job creation" at the Spring Convocation on 4 June 1982.[6][3] George Hinterhoeller was awarded the Canadian Yachting Magazine, Ontario Sailing, 2011 Legends of Ontario Sailing Award as one of the “Builders of C&C Yachts”[7] Hinterhoeller archive[edit] The Marine Museum of the Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario has in its archives the personal drawings and files of noted Canadian boat builder and designer George Hinterhoeller, the donation thanks to his son Richard Hinterhoeller and Hinterhoeller's widow Nona Hinterhoeller.[1] Boat designs[edit] Cygnus 20 – 1965[8] GT-26 (Hinterhoeller) – 1983 Hinterhoeller 25 – 1969 Hinterhoeller 28 – 1967 Hinterhoeller 30 – 1969 HR-25 (Hinterhoeller) – 1969 HR-28 (Hinterhoeller) – 1967 Niagara 26 – 1975 Niagara 30 – 1967 Shark 24 – 1959 See also[edit] List of sailboat designers and manufacturers References[edit] ^ a b "Hinterhoeller Drawings Donated".

Three teenagers (two of whom had been known to Heather) were arrested two weeks after the discovery of her body; each of the three would later be tried and subsequently convicted of Heather's murder. One of the perpetrators would be sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole; a second individual would be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment plus 99 years for conspiracy to commit murder, while the third individual was sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole after 40 years. Conflicting testimony delivered at two of the perpetrators' separate trials leads to ongoing speculation as to which of the trio actually shot and killed Heather.

An academically successful sophomore who was popular with her peers at Waurika High School,[1] she had a notably excitable personality. According to one of her friends, despite her façade of ebullience, Heather was a "very troubled" teenager,[2] and she began to exhibit troublesome behavior both at home and at school in the late summer and early fall of 1996. Her classmate and former boyfriend, 17-year-old Randy Wood, would state this emotional behavior largely stemmed from Heather's restlessness at the fact Waurika held few amenities to entertain the town's youth.[1][n 1] On September 27, she and another girl had been temporarily suspended from Waurika High School and the Waurika Eagles cheerleading team for their being noticeably drunk upon the sidelines of a school cheerleading performance.[1] The duration of this suspension was just three days, and she was expecting to be a potential candidate to be the sophomore class homecoming queen of Waurika High School on October 11.[3] October 2, 1996[edit] At approximately 11 p.m. on the evening of October 2, 1996, Heather left her home without her parents' knowledge to meet a 17-year-old Waurika High School senior named Joshua Bagwell in a trailer parked at the rear of the home of Bagwell's grandfather.[4] Bagwell had already been drinking heavily with his friends, 19-year-old Curtis Gambill and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Wood. One of the trio had earlier telephoned Heather to suggest she join them at Bagwell's trailer that evening.[5] Shortly after Heather arrived at the trailer, both Wood and Gambill left Heather and Bagwell alone for approximately one hour, believing that as this was their first date, the two wished to be left alone. When Wood and Gambill returned to the trailer approximately one hour later, both Bagwell and Heather were naked, and a bottle of gin had been half consumed. Heather was extremely drunk, later being described as largely insensible;[6] Bagwell would later claim the two had engaged in consensual sex. According to Wood's later trial testimony, the three youths, themselves intoxicated, began goading each other to sexually assault Heather while she was naked and largely insensible.[7] Wood then proceeded to sexually assault Heather (digitally penetrating her) before Gambill himself engaged in unconsensual sex with the semi-conscious girl. Shortly after Gambill had engaged in sex with Heather, she partially roused out of her semi-conscious state and began moaning, screaming and crying.[8] Murder[edit] Reportedly fearing the girl would later accuse the trio of rape,[9] Gambill then decided to kill Heather and, with a measure of force, successfully persuaded Bagwell and Wood to assist him in the commission of this act.[10] According to Wood, Gambill pointed his shotgun at him and ordered him to dress Heather before he and Bagwell carried her into Bagwell's grandfather's pickup truck.[11] Bagwell then began to drive in a seemingly aimless manner around southern Oklahoma for in excess of an hour as Gambill repeatedly exclaimed they would have to kill her before driving to desolate property his grandparents owned as a potential murder location. Gambill vetoed Bagwell's choice of a murder location, stating this location could easily be traced to the trio. Gambill then chose to drive the truck; driving towards a cement bridge upon a rural road in Belknap Creek, Texas.[8] At this location, Gambill retrieved his shotgun from the vehicle as he ordered Bagwell and Wood to "get her out and put her on the side (of the road)." Bagwell and Wood then carried Heather towards the bridge, where Gambill proceeded to shoot her several times in the head and torso with the shotgun as she lay upon the ground.[12] Wood would later claim that he had sat inside the pickup truck as Gambill approached Heather with the shotgun in his hand; he had then covered his face with his hands before hearing "the first shot ... then I heard a bunch more."[n 2] He then climbed from the truck to observe Gambill appearing "dazed at what he'd done." Joshua Bagwell then took one of Heather's shoelaces and used this item to secure a rock to weight her body.[13] Heather's body was then thrown over the guard rail into the creek below before the trio attempted to conceal the extensive bloodstains at the precise murder scene by kicking and throwing soil across the ground.[8] Discovering that their daughter's bed had not been slept in and that all her possessions were untouched, yet that her bedroom window was open, Gail and Duane Rich reported Heather missing to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department the following day.[14] Despite the fact Heather had not taken any of her personal possessions with her,[3] when police learned from Gail that Heather had recently argued with her mother over a $300 phone bill for which she (Heather) had largely been responsible for the accrual, investigators initially assumed Heather had likely temporarily ran away from her household to stay with friends, and would likely return home within hours. Aghast, Gail responded: "When your daughter is missing, you can stay at home!" She and her family then began making their own inquiries around Waurika for information as to Heather's whereabouts.[14] They would subsequently hire a private investigator to assist in the search for their daughter.[15] Autopsy[edit] Heather's body was discovered partially submerged in the Red River by a rancher and his daughter on October 10.[n 3] Due to a combination of decomposition and the sheer number of shotgun wounds she had received, including the fact she had been shot once in the back of the head, her face and body were largely unrecognizable. Thus initially, her body was tentatively identified by her father via his recognizing a gold signet ring Heather had received as a present for her 16th birthday. Her body would later be officially identified via dental records.[16][n 4] The autopsy of Heather's body revealed she had been shot nine times with an M-9 Winchester shotgun, with pellets from the buckshot rounds fired also hitting her body in several locations. One of these shots had been fired into the back of her head, with the remaining eight rounds being fired into her lower back, waist, pelvis and buttocks. In conjunction with the pattern of the bloodstains discovered at the preliminary crime scene, the trajectory of the shotgun wounds indicated Heather had most likely been shot as she lay face down, with her death being almost instantaneous. Funeral[edit] The funeral of Heather Rich was conducted on Monday, October 14, 1996 at the Praise Assembly of God Church in Comanche County.[3] She was laid to rest in Fletcher Cemetery. As her murderer or murderers had neither been apprehended or convicted at the time of the service and with her family strongly suspecting her murderer(s) had not been strangers to her, Heather's family forbade any individual outside her immediate family from touching her coffin throughout the service, with her mother stating that prior to the service, she had promised her only daughter that "whoever did this to her would never touch her again."[1] Perpetrators[edit] Curtis Allen Gambill[edit] Curtis Gambill was a high-school dropout. He was born on February 24, 1977, and at the time of Heather's murder, he was living with his 64-year-old grandmother in Terral, Oklahoma. Gambill was known to possess a short temper, and to exhibit sadistic features, being known to have regularly forced boys to fight each other in his presence upon the threat that if they did not do so, they would otherwise have to fight him.[17] He had previously escaped from every youth detention center in which he had been incarcerated, and had been briefly committed to a psychiatric hospital at age 17. In addition, he had been convicted of feloniously carrying a firearm in February 1996; receiving a five-year suspended sentence.[n 5] In the week prior to Heather's disappearance, Gambill was notably depressed due to his best friend, 20-year-old Dennis Goss, having committed suicide on 25 September. Just days prior to October 2, he and his close friend Joshua Bagwell had attended Goss's funeral.[17] Joshua Luke Bagwell[edit] Joshua Bagwell was born on December 21, 1978. His parents were among the wealthiest landowners in southern Oklahoma, although as his parents' employment led them to be largely absent from home, he had lived with his grandparents since the age of 16.[18] Bagwell was a senior at Waurika High School, and by October 1996, had been the recipient of six new cars. He was variously described as being a snobbish and pampered youth, although he was considered somewhat of an outcast among his peers.[19] He and Gambill had formed a mutual friendship, in part due to their shared interests in firearms, drinking, camping, and fishing. Occasionally, the pair traveled to the environs of Belknap Creek for camping and fishing trips.[20] Undisciplined at home, Bagwell had once been arrested for driving while intoxicated, and had demanded a lawyer while resisting arrest. Both Randy Wood and Heather Rich had been impressed by Bagwell's affluent means; the latter commenting on more than one occasion that she had flirted with Bagwell until she had secured a seat in his white Dodge Stealth for the forthcoming Waurika homecoming parade. On the night of October 2, Heather had sneaked from her parents' home to meet Bagwell for what was supposed to be their first date.[15] Randy Lee Wood[edit] Randy Wood was born on July 7, 1979. He and his single-parent mother had frequently relocated throughout Oklahoma during his childhood—frequently resulting in him having to attend numerous different schools. By 1996, Wood lived with his mother in a largely dilapidated house, and his family was known as one of the poorest in Waurika. Wood began smoking cannabis in the third grade, often stealing the money or the narcotic itself from his mother. Despite his personal disadvantages, Wood endeavored to better himself among his peers, and by 1996, was the captain of the Waurika High School football team, having earned the respect of the entire team. He and Heather had dated for approximately five months, during which they had regularly attended church together and conversed on the phone, although their relationship, despite being an intimate one, had never resulted in sexual intercourse, and the two were frequently mistaken as simply being friends. Having heard a rumor Heather had skinny-dipped at a party, Wood chose to end their relationship, although the two remained close friends.[16] One week after Heather's body was found at Belknap Creek, Randy Wood was crowned homecoming king of Waurika High School.[21] Investigation and arrests[edit] A total of 14 investigators were assigned to investigate Heather's murder. The investigation was assisted by the FBI in the event federal kidnapping charges could be brought against the perpetrator or perpetrators should Heather have been transported across state lines against her will. Initially encountering a wall of silence from much of Waurika's youth as to Heather's potential whereabouts, by the second week of the inquiry, investigators focused more closely on a potential lead provided by Heather's best friend on the cheerleading squad that Heather may have left her home to attend a party at the home of a classmate of theirs named Joshua Luke Bagwell. Upon informal questioning, Bagwell initially claimed he and a friend of his named Randy Wood (both of whom had earlier been questioned by Gail Rich as to her daughter's whereabouts) had not seen Heather on October 2 as they had been playing dominoes and drinking whisky and beer in his trailer until approximately 6:00 a.m. the following day. Wood would corroborate this statement.[22] Having discovered that the buckshot rounds fired from the Winchester shotgun which killed Heather were of a distinct brand, investigators soon learned that only one store in Waurika had stocked this brand. Conversing with the owners of the store, these investigators discovered that just days prior to the murder, 20 rounds had been purchased by one Joshua Bagwell. The owner of this store was also able to positively identify Bagwell from an assembled police lineup.[19] Furthermore, an employee of this store was adamant that at the time Bagwell had made this purchase, he had been in the company of another young male.[19] Further discovering that Bagwell had spent much of his time in recent months in the company of a 19-year-old high school dropout named Curtis Allen Gambill, and had regularly hunted in his company,[18] Curtis Gambill was arrested on October 24. He was questioned for a total of eight hours, and agreed to submit to a polygraph test pertaining to his potential culpability in Heather's murder. Gambill failed this polygraph test, and subsequently agreed to allow investigators to subject the shotgun he owned to ballistic fingerprinting to determine whether this firearm had been used to murder Heather Rich.[23][n 6] Discovering the results of the ballistic analysis of his shotgun indicated the firearm had been the one used to murder Heather Rich, and that the weapon was capable of firing nine rounds before requiring reloading, Gambill confessed to being a participant in Heather's murder, also naming Bagwell and Heather's former boyfriend, Randy Lee Wood, as participants in the murder. According to Gambill, Wood had been the instigator of the crime, and the actual murderer, with himself and Bagwell acting upon his (Wood's) instructions. Wood's actual motive, Gambill claimed, had been sexual jealousy due to the fact Heather had engaged in sex with Bagwell and not himself.[24] Bagwell and Wood were also arrested on October 24. Bagwell refused to admit any culpability in Heather's murder; invoking his right to silence and refusing to submit to a polygraph test. Shortly thereafter, his family hired a team of high-profile lawyers to defend him.[25] By contrast, Randy Wood willingly agreed to provide a written statement in which he confessed to his being a participant in the murder, although he was adamant Curtis Gambill had been the instigator of the entire crime, and the individual who had shot and killed Heather, adding that Joshua Bagwell had been a knowing and willing participant. Wood further claimed not to have actually believed Gambill was serious in his vocal intentions to murder Heather until Gambill had parked the pickup upon the Belknap Creek bridge. He also agreed to submit to a polygraph test to verify his version of events—the results of which fully corroborated his written statement. Initially, all three individuals were charged with the kidnapping of Heather and denied bail in Oklahoma.[23] All would subsequently be formally charged with first-degree murder in Montague County, Texas on October 25.[26] The trials of all three defendants were held in Texas. Owing to the law of Texas, all three individuals were tried as adults.[27] Trials[edit] Gambill[edit] Curtis Gambill was brought to trial on October 15, 1997. He was tried in Fort Worth.[10] Shortly after his trial had begun, Gambill accepted a plea bargain offered by Montague County district attorney Tim Cole, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to Heather's murder—admitting to being the individual who had physically taken her life—in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty.[28] He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment with a potential possibility of parole after 30 years.[29] As part of his plea bargain, Gambill also agreed to testify against Bagwell at his upcoming trial.[12][n 7] Montague County courthouse. Both Bagwell and Wood were tried at this location in 1998. Bagwell[edit] Joshua Bagwell was brought to trial in February 1998. Prior to and at his trial, he refused to admit any culpability in her murder; claiming that his intercourse with Heather after Gambill and Wood had initially left the two alone in his trailer had been consensual;[30] that he had later left his trailer prior to Gambill and Wood actually discussing killing Heather; and that he had ultimately believed the trio were simply driving Heather around in an effort to sober her up before returning her home. Furthermore, he stated that he was unaware of any actual plan to murder her.[27] At Bagwell's trial, Gambill reneged upon his own previous agreement with prosecutors; changing his story and reverting to his initial claims upon arrest.[23] This testimony largely suited the portrayal of Bagwell by the defense; minimizing Bagwell's role in the murder and corroborating his own claims that Wood had committed Heather's murder.[30] Randy Wood had initially accepted a similar plea bargain to that previously offered to Gambill in exchange for his testimony at Bagwell's then-forthcoming trial. However, the evening before he was due to give evidence, Wood—against the vehement advice of his defense attorney—changed his mind and rejected the plea bargain,[10] insisting he wished to testify against Bagwell without any preconditions despite being informed by his lawyer that he risked either a longer prison sentence or a potential death penalty if convicted. On the third day of testimony, Wood testified under oath that Gambill had largely orchestrated the murder, had shot and killed Heather, and that Bagwell had been a full, knowing participant in the act.[10][n 8] The day after Wood delivered his testimony, Bagwell testified before the jury. He insisted he had not been present in his trailer when Wood and Gambill had discussed murdering Heather, and blamed Wood for her actual shooting.[25] Bagwell added his conjecture that Wood's motivation for this act had been that he had been angry at Heather for earlier refusing to engage in intercourse with him (Wood). Bagwell finally claimed not to have been physically close to the actual crime scene at the time Heather had actually been murdered, but had walked away to urinate.[34] He solely admitted to a limited role in refusing to disclose acknowledgement of the murder after the event.[4] Despite this testimony, when questioned as to his witnessing the actual shooting of Heather Rich, Bagwell contradicted himself in his reply, claiming he had witnessed "Curtis—sorry I mean Randy—lowering the gun."[13] Joshua Bagwell was convicted of capital murder on February 14, 1998 and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment.[27] He was sentenced to a mandatory life term.[4] He would later be sentenced to an additional sentence of 99 years for conspiracy to commit capital murder on February 17.[35] "There's not a day that goes by that I don’t think about her. Heather is the first thing I think of in the morning, and the last thing at night ... I punish myself worse than anything in this prison ever could." Randy Lee Wood, reflecting on his memories of Heather Rose Rich and his actions on the night of her murder. July 2002.[1] Wood[edit] Randy Wood was tried for capital murder later in 1998. Against the advice of his attorney, Pat Morris, Wood declined another plea bargain offered prior to his trial; choosing to plead not guilty to Heather's murder, stating that although he was aware of the law of Texas, he had neither intended for Heather to be killed, and that he had not physically taken her life himself.[7][n 9] Wood was found guilty of capital murder on August 25, 1998. As the State did not seek the death penalty in his trial, he was automatically sentenced to life imprisonment. Wood will first become eligible for parole in 2036.[7][36] Aftermath[edit] Randy Wood requested to meet with Heather's parents prior to his own trial, to explain his actions on the night of their daughter's murder, the moral and legal reasoning behind his course of action regarding his testimony at the trial of Joshua Bagwell, and the legal vulnerability this had subjected himself to. Heather's parents agreed to this endeavor.[37] In an televised interview, Wood stressed his regret regarding his actions in the early morning hours of October 3, 1996. Having asked for their forgiveness but stating upfront he did not expect to receive it, Gail Rich responded by stating she and her husband had forgiven him for the hurt he had caused them, but they could not forgive him for his role in their daughter's murder, adding, "Only Heather can do that."[38] In 1999, Wood filed an appeal against his conviction with the Second Court of Appeals of Texas. In this appeal, he did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented at his trial, but contended that his attorney had been ineffective in his service; failing to request an initial instruction upon the potential lesser-included offense of murder, an erroneous introduction of the guilty or innocence plea phase of his trial, and his attorney's failing to raise objection at this stage. This appeal was overruled on October 14, 1999.[39] Joshua Bagwell also appealed his sentencing; his appeal was filed with the Second Court of Appeals of Texas in November 2000, arguing that because Heather had been unconscious when taken to the Belknap Creek bridge, she could not move, and if unable to move, she therefore had no movements to restrain, and restraint of the victim is an integral component of kidnapping. As such, Bagwell contended, because the Texas Penal Code defines capital murder as "a level of murder that requires a kidnapping component", he could not be guilty of the level of murder for which he was convicted. This appeal was rejected on January 31, 2001. In January 2002, Curtis Gambill and Joshua Bagwell were transferred from state prison to the Montague County jail in order that Gambill could be additionally tried for conspiracy to commit murder.[40] On January 16, he (Gambill) was additionally convicted and sentenced to a second, cumulative, term of life imprisonment.[41] He had earlier waived his legal right to a trial by jury.[42] Curtis Gambill, Joshua Bagwell and two other inmates briefly escaped from the Montague County Jail in which all four were held in January 2002.[43] All four escapees were arrested nine days later in Ardmore, Oklahoma.[1] The four individuals had held a member of public hostage at an Oklahoma gas station, but surrendered to authorities after several hours.[44] In 2009, a cousin of Randy Wood named Denise Horner initiated a campaign for a commutation of Wood's potential life sentencing. This campaign was endorsed and supported by the prosecutor at Wood's trial, Tim Cole, who was reportedly regretful that he had not tried Wood for the lesser charge of conspiracy to commit murder.[7] Nonetheless, when Cole approached Montague County district attorney in 2010, he was reluctant to consider the proposal. He would later confirm his decision to Denise Horner in 2011, stating that following his consultations with the Sheriff and District Judge, it had been "my understanding from them that they are also unwilling to recommend a reduction of sentence."[7] In 2016, Randy Wood married a woman from New Zealand. The two had initially corresponded as friends, although they gradually formed a relationship after she traveled to Texas to meet him face-to-face. This woman—who wishes to remain anonymous—moved to Texas in 2018 in order to be closer to Wood. One of the motivations for her decision to relocate to Texas is her commitment to campaign for those under the age of 18 not to be tried as adults within the state. Although Wood's wife has stated that she hopes he will be released long before his initial parole eligibility date, she has stated she is committed to remain with him.[45] All three perpetrators of Heather's murder remain incarcerated and all serve their sentences in different Texas prisons. Curtis Gambill is currently incarcerated at the John M. Wynne Unit in northern Huntsville; Joshua Bagwell is incarcerated at the Barry Telford Unit in New Boston;[46] and Randy Wood is incarcerated at the James V. Allred Unit in Wichita Falls.[47] Media[edit] Literature[edit] Colloff, Pamela (2007). Texas True Crime: From the Editors of Texas Monthly. Austin: University of Texas Press. pp. 172–179.

With agreement from Heather's parents, he agreed to offer Gambill the plea bargain whereby Gambill agreed to testify against Bagwell in exchange for his agreeing not to seek a death sentence against him at his then-forthcoming trial. ^ Wood has since been quoted as saying that, although aware of the risk factors by taking this course of action,[31] he had done so both for his own peace of mind, for the benefit of Heather and her family,[10] and also to improve the credibility of his testimony, stating: "I figure I owe it to [Heather] and her parents and her family."[32] He has since stated: "I knew it would make people see I was telling the truth."[33][25] ^ The fact that Randy had not actually fired the gun did not differentiate the legal viewpoint in Texas Law. Under the Law of Texas, all three teenagers—not just the gunman—were considered equally responsible for Heather's murder. References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k Colloff, Pamela (July 1, 2002).

Contents 1 History 2 Landmarks 3 Notable people 4 See also 5 References History[edit] In 1389, a dispute arose over the rights to mint coins between the Duke of Burgundy, and the Archbishop of Besançon Guillaume de Vergy. The Bishop excommunicated the duke and several companions. In response, the Duke of Burgundy gave siege to the fortresses of Noroy and the castle of Gy. However, the Archbishop escaped via an underground passage and found refuge in Avignon where he excommunicated the count of Burgundy.[2] By 1801, the population of the town had reached 2,695, and peaked about a decade later. By 1901 it had dropped to 1,621[3] people and by 2017, only 1,049.[4] Landmarks[edit] The Château de Gyrésidence des archevêques de Besançon Habitat vigneron et vieux bourg médiéval Hôtel de ville de Gy Église Saint-Symphorien de Gy Grande fontaine de Gy Lavoir de Gy Notable people[edit] Claude-Antoine Bolot Luis Francisque Lélut Noël André (1728-1808).[5][6] Charles Marie Albert Travelet.[7] The Château de Gy The Grande fontaine de Gy See also[edit] Communes of the Haute-Saône department References[edit] ^ "Populations légales 2017".

He studied at St. Francis Xavier High School in New York,[2] before entering the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1898.[1] He proceeded to the novitiate in Frederick, Maryland, where spent his novice and scholastic years there, with the exception of one year spent at St. Andrew-on-Hudson in Poughkeepsie, New York. He then was sent to Woodstock College in Maryland to study philosophy for three years.[2] Canning next taught for four years at St. Francis Xavier High School, and then for a year at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. He then returned to Woodstock for four more years of theology.[2] There, he was ordained by Cardinal James Gibbons as a subdeacon, deacon, and priest on June 26, 27, and 28, 1915 respectively. He celebrated his first Mass the following day.[3] He then spent a final year at St. Andrew-on-Hudson, studying ascetical theology.[2] He attained to the rank of gradus[a] in the Society of Jesus on February 2, 1918.[1] Missionary[edit] In 1920,[5] following the completion of his studies, Canning was sent to Jamaica as a missionary. For eight years, he taught at St. George College in Kingston.[2] He also ministered at Holy Trinity Cathedral and at the military station at Port Royal.[6] Academia[edit] Upon his return to the United States in 1925, Canning taught at Gonzaga College High School in Washington, D.C.[2] He then served as prefect of studies at St. Peter's High School in Jersey City, New Jersey,[7] before returning to Gonzaga for three years. Canning became an administrator at St. Isaac Jogues Novitiate in Wernersville, Pennsylvania for two-and-a-half years, before transferring to St. Francis Xavier High School in February 1934.[2] On September 2, 1934, Canning became president of Loyola College in Maryland, succeeding Henri J. Wiesel.[8] His term as president came to an end in 1938, and he was succeeded by Edward B. Bunn.[2] Following the end of his presidency, he returned to St. Peter's High School in Jersey City, where he became spiritual director for the Jesuit community there. He also served as a parish priest at St. Peter's Catholic Church.[2] Canning died in Jersey City on March 23, 1951. His funeral was held on March 26, and was attended by Thomas J. Murry, the president of Loyola College, on behalf of the school.[2] Notes[edit] ^ The culmination of a Jesuit scholastic's philosophical and theological studies was the examen ad gradum, which tested knowledge of doctrine.[4] References[edit] Citations[edit] ^ a b c Mendizàbal 1972, p. 459 ^ a b c d e f g h i j "Former Head of Loyola Dies".

Oknha Truong Cang (Khmer: ទ្រឿង កាង, also spelled Troueung Kang[1]; 1913–?) was a Cambodian politician and diplomat. Truong Cang was a Khmer Krom.[2] He served as finance minister (1957-58, 1959) and foreign minister (1958) of Cambodia.[3] He was also a member of the High Council of the Throne.[4] With his efforts, International Court of Justice (ICJ) awarded ownership of Preah Vihear Temple to Cambodia in 1962.[4][5] From 1964 to 1969 he was the ambassador to China.[3] In 1967, the Chinese embassy in Cambodia published and distributed Communist propaganda to the Cambodian populace praising the Cultural Revolution, which irritated Norodom Sihanouk. Sihanouk threatened to break off diplomatic relations with China.[6] Truong Cang was about to leave Beijing, but finally was persuaded to stay in China by Chinese premier Zhou Enlai.[7] From 1972 to 1973 he was the permanent representative to the United Nations.[3] Truong Cang was regarded as a national hero by Khmer nationalists.[citation needed] In Phnom Penh, Oknya Truong Cang Road was named after him.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ Written Record of Interview of CHAN Youran ចាន់ យូរ៉ាន់ ^ Nicholas Tarling (July 2014).

The single topped the US Billboard Alternative Songs, Adult Alternative Songs, and Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles charts, as well as reaching number three on the US Billboard Rock Songs chart. "You Are a Tourist" is Death Cab for Cutie's first (and currently only) number one alternative hit, and their highest charting single on the US alternative chart to date.[1] Contents 1 Background 2 Release and reception 3 Music video 4 Charts 4.1 Weekly charts 4.2 Year-end charts 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Background[edit] The song's original demo contained a sample from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's Dazzle Ships (1983), and was shared online by Gibbard via SoundCloud in 2016.[2] The song was developed late in the recording process for Codes and Keys, after much of the album had been completed. The band immediately took to the song, and knew quickly it would be the album's lead single. Gibbard called the verses of the tune catchy, light affirmations that are expanded upon in the bridge,[3] which encourages the listener to relocate: "If you feel just like a tourist/ In the city you were born/ Then it’s time to go/ And define your destination/ There’s so many different places to call home".[4] Release and reception[edit] The song debuted on Seattle radio station 107.7 The End on March 28, 2011,[5] and was available for digital download the following day.[6] The band performed the song live on VH1 Storytellers on May 27, 2011.[7] Billboard reviewer Ryan Reed said the track "crackles with psychedelic sunshine. Strands of reversed noise bubble under drummer Jason McGerr's impeccable time-keeping, and an army of effects-smeared guitar overdubs wiggle together in an irresistible groove."[8] Larry Fitzmaurice at Pitchfork felt the song sounded like a "generic version of the band from an earlier era."[9] David Malitz of The Washington Post considered the sentiment of the tune "nothing new, but at least it sounds fresh."[10] Music video[edit] The official music video for "You Are a Tourist" was filmed live, and streamed online on April 5, 2011. The clip was shot on a soundstage at 204 Studios in Hollywood, California.[11] The idea for the video stemmed from the band's longtime collaborator, Aaron Stewart-Ahn. According to the band, "You Are a Tourist" was the first ever live, scripted, one-take music video shoot.[12] Though previous videos had been filmed live, "You Are a Tourist" utilizes complicated choreography and camera moves. The video was directed by Tim Nackashi and accomplished in one take, using multiple cameras, and no edits or re-takes. The production employed dancers, actors, and projected images.[13][14] Charts[edit] Weekly charts[edit] Chart (2011) Peakposition US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles (Billboard)[15] 1 US Adult Alternative Songs (Billboard)[16] 1 US Alternative Airplay (Billboard)[17] 1 US Rock Songs (Billboard)[18] 3 Japan (Japan Hot 100)[19] 60 Year-end charts[edit] Chart (2010) Position US Alternative Songs (Billboard)[20] 13 US Hot Rock Songs (Billboard)[21] 16 See also[edit] List of number-one Billboard Alternative Songs of 2011 References[edit] ^ Alternative Songs, Billboard.com, issue date July 9, 2011 ^ Maine, Samantha (June 24, 2016).

The initial intake was 300 children and 12 staff. Mr H E Cooke was the first headmaster. Over the next seven years a house block, theatre and swimming pool were added with an official opening in 1964. The school was built to accommodate the baby boom caused by the large number of children born after the end of the Second World War. It was renamed Buttershaw Comprehensive School, and over the years it evolved into an Upper, then High School, removing its pool for an AstroTurf field. On 23 September 2006 over 100 pupils from the first intake of 1956 met at the Cedar Court Hotel, Bradford to celebrate the school's Golden Anniversary. In the 2007 Queens Birthday Honours list David Kershaw, the school's first head boy (1956), was made a CBE for his services to education. 2008 saw the opening of the new building. As the new building was opened the school was renamed Buttershaw Business and Enterprise College. Buttershaw Business and Enterprise College became a foundation school administered by the Buttershaw Learning and Achievement Trust and Bradford City Council. However in September 2016 the school converted to academy status and is now sponsored by the Bradford Diocesan Academies Trust. Academics[edit] Buttershaw Business and Enterprise College offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels and further BTECs.

Because of that we can say that we can make our independent policies and make independent decisions."[10] The New York Times reported on 9 August 2018 that Trump's senior national security advisors, concerned that Trump might disrupt the summit as he did by refusing to sign the communiqué at the June G7 summit, scrambled to secure a formal policy agreement during the weeks before the summit.[11] Security[edit] For the first time a RF Drone Detection System was used (a white dome seen at the right rooftop of the summit picture).

His father's family was Old English and descended from Sir Henry Dillon who came to Ireland with Prince John in 1185.[2] His family held substantial lands in Meath, Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon. James's mother was a daughter of James Bathe (c. 1500 – 1570), who also was a Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. She was James's father's first wife. His father's second marriage seems to have been childless. Family tree James Dillon with wife, parents, and other selected relatives.

James was one of seven brothers and had five sisters. James listed among his brothers He heads the list of his brothers below as the eldest: James (died 1641); Henry (died 1609) of Kentstown in Meath;[4] Christopher, died childless;[5] Oliver, died childless;[5] Alexander, died childless;[5] John, either died childless[5] or married a daughter of Sir William Sarsfield of Lucan;[6] Robert, settled in King's County (now Offaly);[7] James's sisters Janet, also called Genet, married Christopher Plunkett, the 9th Baron Killeen (1564–1613) and was the mother of the 1st Earl of Fingall;[8][9] Elinor, married Robert Rochfort of Kilbride;[10] Elizabeth; Margaret, married John Sarsfield of Shurninges;[11] and Anne, married Richard Plunket of Rathmore.[12] Stepmother[edit] Dillon's mother, Jane Bathe, must have died about 1570 as his father remarried in 1575 to Marion Barnewall, née Sharl (or Sherle), the widow of Sir Christopher Barnewall (1522–1575) of Turvey House, Dublin.[13][14] Marion, his stepmother, had 15 children from her first marriage, among them Eleanor with whom James fell in love. Marriage and children[edit] Mr Dillon married Eleanor Barnewall, also called Helen, his step-sister through his father's second marriage. She was a daughter of Sir Christopher Barnewall.[15][16][17] James and Eleanor had 13 children, seven sons:[18] Robert (died 1642) became the 2nd Earl;[19] Lucas of Twomere, or of Trinity Island, County Cavan, from whom the 9th, 10th and 11th earls descended,[20] married Mary, daughter of Sir John Thorpe;[21] Thomas, died unmarried;[22] Christopher, died unmarried;[22] George, died unmarried;[22] John, died unmarried;[22] and Patrick, from whom the 12th and last Earl descended,[23] married Jame Malone, daughter of Baron Malone.[24] —and six daughters:[25] Jane, married in 1604 her distant cousin Sir Christopher Dillon, son of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon,[26][27] Elizabeth, married Hussey, Baron Galtrim;[28] Frances, married the playwright and politician Henry Burnell and had many children, including the poet Eleanor Burnell.[29] Margaret, married a Nugent of Drumcree;[30] Mary, married sir John Bellew;[31] and Alison, married Roger O'Farrell of Morrin, chief of his name.[32] Later life, death and timeline[edit] Dillon's father died in 1592 in Dublin.[33] There must have been some complications with the inheritance as he obtained special livery of his inheritance on 8 April 1595.[34] In 1599 Dillon raised a troop of 25 horse loyal to Elizabeth I at his own expense, to help keep order in County Roscommon. His grandson James, his son Robert's the eldest son and future 3rd Earl, was born in 1605.[35] Dillon was knighted by King James.[36] On 24 January 1620 Sir James Dillon, as he was now, was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Dillon of Kilkenny-West, in the Peerage of Ireland.[37] This elevation was announced in a ceremony performed by the chief governor of Ireland, Lord Deputy Oliver St. John, in the Presence Chamber of Dublin Castle on 25 January.[38] On 5 August 1622 Lord Kilkenny-West was advanced to the dignity of Earl of Roscommon.[39] His baronial title became a subsidiary title, which he gave as a courtesy title to his heir apparent as is the custom. His eldest son Robert therefore was styled Lord Kilkenny-West 1622–1641.[40] Lord Roscommon was a signatory of a response to Charles I from the Lords of the Pale that established a military force to protect The Crown's interests in Ireland.[41] In 1627, he was a Commissioner for raising money for the King's Army in Meath, Westmeath and Longford. His wife predeceased him on 11 October 1628.[42] On 14 July 1634, Lord Roscommon took his seat in the Irish House of Lords.[43] This was the first Irish Parliament called by King Charles I. He died in March 1641[44] and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Robert as the 2nd Earl of Roscommon.[45] Timeline Age Date Event 0 1565, estimate Born.[a] 10 1575 His father married 2ndly Marion Barnewall, née Sharl after his mother's death.[13] 22 1587, about Married Eleanor (or Helen), 2nd Daughter of Sir Christopher Barnewall by Marion Sharl, his stepmother.[16] 27 1592 Father died in Dublin.[33] 30 1595, 8 Apr Had special livery of his inheritance.[34] 34 1599 Raised a troop of 25 horse loyal to Elizabeth I at his own expense in 1599 38 1603, 24 Mar Accession of King James I, replacing Queen Elizabeth I.[46] 39 1604, Nov His daughter Jane married Christopher Dillon of Ballylaghan, the heir apparent of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon. 40 1605, about His grandson James, the future 3rd Earl, was born.[35] 55 1620, 24 Jan Created Baron Dillon of Kilkenny-West.[37] 57 1622, 5 Aug Elevated to Earl of Roscommon.[39] 60 1625, 27 Mar Accession of King Charles I, replacing King James I.[47] 63 1628, 11 Oct His wife died.[42] 63 1634, 14 Jul Took his seat in the Irish House of Lords.[43] 76 1641, Mar Died.[44] Notes and references[edit] ^ He must be born before 1575 when his father married his 2nd wife.

Neoplanet was a "plug-out" extension for Internet Explorer which created an integrated branded environment for the user. Within the environment, users could web browse, email, and chat. Much simpler to use than basic browsers, Neoplanet was a portal-like browser created for non-techie users.[3] Unlike web portals which lost control of the users every time they surfed to a new site, chatted, or emailed, Neoplanet's environment followed the users wherever they went on the Internet.[4] The Neoplanet program was originally created by James Friskel.[5] Neoplanet Inc. was a subsidiary of Bigfoot International, Inc. Both companies were founded by Lenny Barshack and James Hoffman.

It featured a built-in directory of channels further divided into categories and was for use with Windows 95 and NT. In the fall of 1998 Bigfoot released the NeoPlanet 2.0 version with a new feature of customizable interface. It was positioned as an adjunct to Netscape which it required to run, and as an alternative to Microsoft's and AOL offerings. The new version also featured Snap (a joint-venture between CNET and NBC) and Alexa services incorporated into the browser.[6] The free 1.9MB download was a significant interface upgrade with four skins included and 16 more available on the newly launched NeoPlanet site, while the Microsoft Internet Explorer's underlying features remained unchanged.[7] In January 1999, Bigfoot spun out the NeoPlanet division into NeoPlanet, Inc. By spring 2000, NeoPlanet had moved its headquarters to Tempe, Arizona. It then raised $23 million from Integral Capital, J & W Seligman, Constellation Ventures, Broadview and several other investors during the second round of funding.[8] Drew Cohen, hired by Barshack and Hoffman to head the new venture, relocated several Bigfoot team members to work on the project, including Warren Adelman (Business Development), Thomas Santoriello (Creative Design), and Frank Robledano (Content Direction). One of NeoPlanet's primary business strategies was to provide customizable browser interfaces to third parties, pioneering the branded browsers niche. McAfee and Terra Lycos were among NeoPlanet's first partners, each launching multiple versions of branded browsers.[9][10] Also in 1999, NeoPlanet, together with New Line Cinema, launched the Austin Powers browser to coincide with the premiere date of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.[11] The Austin Powers Browser marked NeoPlanet's first branded browser for a feature film. The NeoPlanet/New Line launch of the Dr. Evil Browser soon followed. With the release of version 5.0, Neoplanet made a move toward virtual communities. The browser described as an "Internet Desktop" added Macromedia Flash, instant messaging and the sharing of channels and other user-generated content.[12] Throughout 2000, NeoPlanet garnered partnerships to market and distribute branded browsers with major companies in the entertainment, computer manufacturing and sports arenas, including Universal Studios, Interscope/Geffen/A&M Records, USA Networks, MTV, The Lord of the Rings, TV Guide, Hewlett Packard, Carolina Hurricanes and Phoenix Coyotes. Also, a "matching skins" campaign with RealNetworks allowed users to match the look-and-feel of the NeoPlanet Browser with that of RealNetworks' RealJukebox TM. Neoplanet's Grinch browser featuring custom branding of Internet Explorer, integrated email, channels and communities Also in 2000, Universal Pictures launched the official Grinch Web Browser at www.meanone.com to promote the movie Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The new browser featured unique interface designs with sounds and images from The Grinch movie and direct "channel" links to Grinch Web sites and the Universal Pictures Web sites. The Grinch Browser also featured a Lycos/Grinch Club, an integrated online community that provided movie fans with a vehicle for sharing similar interests with other users.[13] In 2001 NeoPlanet released its Viassary suite designed to personalize PC users` experience and to help companies to better understand and communicate with their customers.[14] Compaq and HP were among its clients. As of 2001 the number of Neoplanet users reached 8 million.[15] Later that year, Bigfoot International Incorporated was divided and sold off by the Acxiom Corporation due to loss of investment and the dot-com collapse. Features[edit] The client part of NeoPlanet browser resided on the desktop as a small application environment (less than 2Mbs) providing: Internet navigation, an embedded customizable directory, a new level of personalization through customization of the GUI, integrated e-mail, chat and automatic updates. The customizability of the application created ability for distribution and content partners to brand the user's online experience. The server side of NeoPlanet's product enabled collection of rich data about the end-user's online experience, enabling timely and relevant targeted advertising. Skins[edit] Skins were a prominent feature of NeoPlanet, so much so that it is reported that the first ever use of the term "skin" as describing a customized interface was the result of a conversation between Robledano, Santoriello, and Friskel at a local pub, and after that was swiftly picked up by technology enthusiasts. It was the first browser to be fully skinnable. Many skins were created by users.[16] NeoPlanet became popular for creating browsers for movies, such as New Line Cinema's Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me or Universal Pictures' How the Grinch Stole Christmas and sports teams, such as the Phoenix Coyotes. The browser had been branded by MTV, USA Networks, Interscope-Geffen-A&M, Hewlett-Packard, TV Guide among others. It had over 550 available skins as for October 2001[17] and 15 million skins downloads.[18] Integrated apps[edit] In addition to e-mail, NeoPlanet integrated other Internet communications features, specifically, instant messaging, e-mail, and bookmark sharing. The Channel Bar: customizable bookmarks[edit] NeoPlanet was the first browser to include sophisticated bookmark management, what was referred to as the "Channel Bar". The channels offered a simple tree structure interface where users could visit the site and download entire channel packs related to specific types of content, sets of bookmarks that featured “best of” links for special interests, local information and web based resources, such as "Art", "Automotive", "Technology", and many others. Users were encouraged to share their own channels on the NeoPlanet site. Technology[edit] NeoPlanet's client server architecture was built to allow future models to be plugged in via an object model. NeoPlanet's auto-update feature was designed to facilitate deploying these new features. The front-end was a complex layered series of software objects that are presented to the user as one unified application. This was accomplished through an abstraction layer which allows for independence of the HTML rendering engines, independence of look and feel for re-branding/distribution by partners, and communication with the NeoPlanet back-end. The NeoPlanet front-end had the ability to dynamically respond to requests from the back-end to update itself in whole or in part. NeoPlanet's client/server architecture also included a scalable back-end server component. The NeoPlanet back-end had the ability to track and target marketing and promotions, even through corporate firewalls.

series, co-produced with The Open University, that places a family of two parents and four children in their home with only the amenities available during each of the previous three decades (1970s, 1980s and 1990s), and recording their responses to the changing pace of technological change. The intent of the series was to be "much more than a technology show … it is contemporary social history and asks big moral questions about life in the modern world". Narrated by actor and comedian Robert Llewellyn, the series first aired on the UK digital terrestrial channel BBC Four in September and October 2009. It was later sold for international broadcast in 2010 and 2011. Contents 1 Background 1.1 Guests 2 Inception and production 3 Reviews 4 International broadcasts 5 Episodes 6 References 7 External links Background[edit] There are three episodes; "The 1970s", "The 1980s" and "The 1990s". Each covers a period of ten days, one for each year, with a counter over the front door showing the current year. New devices and amenities - as well as clothing and interior designs - are provided as appropriate as days go by (for example, a home computer in 1982, and a VCR in 1984), and sometimes removed as they go out of date. The programme follows the family's adaption and reaction to being thrown back in time to a more technologically sparse period; and how their pastimes, social interactions and attitudes change in response to both landing in the early 1970s and coming up-to-date. They are not kept isolated "Big Brother" style over the course of the series; instead life continues "normally" - the parents go to work, children to school, friends come over, videos are (only just) rented, and dinner parties held. The series concludes with the family hosting their own Millennium party (to the children's initial confusion) with friends and neighbours in attendance. Their general opinion is one of relief to be returned to the 21st century and its more widely electronically connected society, but that some lessons have been learned from the past on how making more time for family togetherness actually made them happier than their previously quite personally insular existence. Guests[edit] Guests appearing on the show included Sir Clive Sinclair, members of Ultravox, Simon Munnery, Patrick Bossert and Keith Stewart of The Guardian, a gaming journalist and Simon Webb, curator of the Museum of Computing in Swindon. Although cut from the final version, Jason Fitzpatrick of The Centre for Computing History was also interviewed about the Altair 8800 computer. Many of the gadgets used in the documentary were supplied by the museum.[1] Inception and production[edit] The program was produced by Wall to Wall, an independent UK production company with a long track record of educational reality programming, including The 1900 House (1999), Who Do You Think You Are?. (2004–present), and Man on Wire, winner of an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature (2008). Wall to Wall was jointly commissioned by the BBC and the Open University to produce the series in early 2009. Mark Ball, Commissioning Editor of the BBC said at the time, "It will be much more than a technology show … it is contemporary social history and asks big moral questions about life in the modern world".[2] The Sullivan-Barnes family was selected to appear after they responded to a letter sent to their son's school by the producers of the program.[3] The Sullivan-Barneses are a blended family, father Adam Barnes and his daughter Steffi (age 12 at the time of filming), mother Georgie Sullivan and her two children, Hamish (13) and Ellie (12), and their son together Jude, age 2, Mr. Barnes an accountant with BP and his wife a manager with the NHS.[4] Adam Barnes said he was drawn to the project because of the chance of being reintroduced to the technologies that interested him as a youth and, as he said to an interviewer afterwards, "the chance to ride classic cars".[5] Filming occurred over the winter of 2009, which was particularly cold and snowy for England, a fact which figured into the story when the family had to endure cold nights early in the project when the lack of central heating was simulated for the 70s episode. The house was renovated before each "decade" to reflect the design styles of each era. While these renovations were being completed, the family lived in a cottage nearby.[5] Technologies and styles featured in each program 1970s 1980s 1990s 2009 Decor 1970s in furniture Laura Ashley n/a n/a Clothing 1970s in fashion 1980s in fashion 1990s in fashion 2000s in fashion Transport Cortina Mark IIRaleigh ChopperSpace hopper Escort 1.3lSinclair C5 Toyota Town Ace Land Rover Discovery Kitchen andAppliances TeasmadeTwin tub washerFreezerToasterAtora brand lardBejam Microwave ovenDeep fat fryerSlow cooker Water filterAGA cookerBreadmaker (1998) not stated Communication Rotary dial telephone Ansaphone Motorola International 3200Dial-up 56k modem (1997)Nokia SMSPay-as-you-go Mobile phone (1998)Text messaging (1998) mobile phones (5)Internet Toys andGadgets Atari PongHand held calculatorBlack and white TVColour TV (1976)LP recordsCassette tapesKerPlunkBinatone (8-bit computer) Polaroid instant cameraComponent stereoCompact disc playerVHS cameraVHS recorderHand held gamesAmstrad CPCSimonBetamaxZX SpectrumCommodore 64Sony WalkmanBBC MicroRemote controllerSynthesizerRubik's cube Super Nintendo Entertainment SystemMega Drive (1990)Game BoyGame GearWindows 3.1 OS (1992)Oxford Children's Encyclopedia on CD-ROMApple QuickTake 100 (1994)Windows 95 OSPlayStation (PS1) (1995)Tamagotchi (1996)Laptop computerPalm PilotKaraoke machine (1999) games consoles (3) DVD players (3)televisions (6)computers (7)[6] Reviews[edit] The Guardian's Kathryn Flett said that it was "warm, funny and done with impeccable attention to detail".[7] Meanwhile, the television critic for The Telegraph found the reality show premise predictable, saying, "the programme carefully followed the formula laid down in the Ancient Texts. The mother, Georgie, gave a wistful sigh and said she hoped they would get to ‘spend more time together as a family', the narrator threatened to rupture himself with mirth as the Sullivan-Barneses walked towards their home – ‘They have no idea what lies behind their front door!' – and the children duly emitted shrieks of delight upon seeing that the house had been transformed into something that even Dave Hill from Slade might have blanched at".[6] TeamTeaBag found Electric Dreams "an enjoyable mini-series" but that "the 'reality' side of it didn't really fit well with the technological exploration. More attention could have been paid to the technology itself as any reaction is of secondary importance".[8] Conversely, TV Throng called it "gadget porn", as it dwelled more on the technologies than on the family's reactions.[9] International broadcasts[edit] Despite its UK focus that sometimes featured products not marketed in other parts of the world, such as the C5 and Teasmade, the series proved salable in other markets. The programme was seen in Asia on History Channel in late January 2010 and on Knowledge, the British Columbia public educational broadcaster, which aired the series weekly beginning on 6 October 2010. In Australia the series was broadcast by Channel Ten and narrated by Amanda Keller.[10] Much of the music used throughout the show on the BBC airing, including the main theme by Philip Oakey "Together in Electric Dreams", were removed from foreign airings presumably due to licensing and copyright reasons. Episodes were edited and shortened due to advertising on the Australian showing. In the US, the series was purchased for broadcast by PBS early in 2011 as part of a large purchase of more than 200 programming hours negotiated by BBC Showcase Syndication, the US marketing wing of the BBC.[11] WGBH of Boston aired the program in April 2011. In France, Encyclo broadcast the show in 2012 dubbed in French. In Italy, the Rai (National Broadcast Company) broadcast the show in 2014 dubbed in Italian, on the educational channel Rai Scuola.

After nearly going bankrupt only six months after opening, the venue managed to keep thriving. However, in 1998, due to financial problems, Sankeys Soap closed its doors to the public. In 2000, the club was revived by business partners David Vincent and Sacha Lord-Marchionne. This time the club was more successful than before, tackling the problems that had crippled its previous owners. In 2006, the club was forced to close once more, much to the dismay of clubbers. David Vincent announced that this time Sankeys Soap would be closed for good.[4] Later that summer, it was announced that the club was to re-open under the shorter name Sankeys. It would be under the direction of David Vincent who invited Andy Spiro to get involved once again. During its closure the club underwent a major refit involving a brand new LED lighting system and featured the "hatongue" who took over from the legendary "Mad Graham" after the PAR cans were removed. The main DJ booth was also replaced by a new circular box. In 2009, owing to the success of the new club, 15 further changes were made to celebrate 15 years of the Sankeys dynasty. These included dynamic ceiling lighting in the Spektrum (the upstairs part of the club) as well as a beach constructed with 50 tonnes of Bahamas Sand and the introduction of a state-of-the-art barcoded entry system. In 2010, Sankeys was voted the number one club in the world in a DJ Mag reader poll.[5] Following the success of 2010, David Vincent announced plans to create "Seven Sankeys" of the World in the seven cities that inspired the original Sankeys.[6] The music policy at Sankeys was varied but focused on underground electronic music, mainly House & Techno. The club also hosted one-off nights from outside promoters.[1] Resident DJs over the years included Greg Vickers, Bushwacka!, Jozef K, Darius Syrossian, Ellesse, Ryan Croft, Adam Chappell, OD Muzique, Pete Zorba, and Luke Welsh. On 11 April 2013, Sankeys announced they would be closing the doors again on 6 May 2013.[7] On 12 November 2013, Sankeys announced on their Ibiza Twitter feed that they would be re-opening Manchester in January 2014.[8] On 12 January 2017, Sankeys announced that they were permanently closing with immediate effect, after the building they occupied had been sold to be turned into apartments.[9] Sankeys Ibiza[edit] In May 2011 Sankeys began operations in Playa d’en Bossa, Ibiza. The Venue was the first of the Seven Sankeys of the World venture that David Vincent has embarked upon. In 2012, Sankeys Ibiza continued successfully for a second season in Ibiza with key residencies at the venue including Viva Warriors fronted by Steve Lawler and Solomun's Diynamic Neon Nights. During the 2013 Ibiza season at Sankeys, the Seven Wonders of the World theme made a return with parties running seven nights a week. Viva Warriors and Diynamic Neon Nights continued their residencies on Sundays and Tuesdays respectively, alongside Hypercolour on Mondays, FUSE on Wednesdays, dirtybird on Thursdays, Flying Circus on Fridays and Carnival Cities on Saturdays. Sankeys Ibiza is part of biggest global DJ project, burn Residency that for the 4th year in the row, take place in Ibiza. Sankeys New York[edit] On 31 October 2013, Sankeys New York (Manhattan) opened as the third Sankeys nightclub. It hosted its 3-day opening weekend during Halloween 2013. It was located at 29 W 36th Street, Manhattan, New York, 10018 (previously District 36 nightclub), but closed after less than a year. On 30 October 2014, Sankeys opened in Brooklyn for Halloween weekend, however this location closed on 20 November 2014, three weeks after opening.

It is the brightest of the far southern planetary nebulae. This nebula was discovered by Sir John Herschel in March 1834, and is easily visible through small telescopes. The round or even slightly oval diameter is telescopically between 8 and 10 arcsec, though deep images extends this to about 19 or 20 arcsec. More surprising is the beautiful rich blue colour that looks much like the coloured images of Neptune taken by Voyager 2 in 1989. Spectroscopy reveals NGC 3918 is approaching us at 17±3.0 kilometres per second, while the nebulosity is expanding at around 24 kilometres per second. The central star is 14.6 visible light magnitude, and remains invisible to optical observers, as it is obscured by the sheer brightness of the surrounding nebula.[2] The distance is estimated at 1.5 kpc (4 900 ly) .

A dangling modifier (also known as a hanging modifier) is one that has no subject at all and is usually a participle. It is also called illogical participle. For example, a writer may have meant to modify the subject, but word order used means that the modifier appears to modify an object instead. Such ambiguities can lead to unintentional humor, or, in formal contexts, difficulty in comprehension. Take, for example, the sentence Turning the corner, a handsome school building appeared.[2] The modifying clause Turning the corner is clearly supposed to describe the behavior of the narrator (or other observer), but grammatically it appears to apply either to nothing in particular, or to the "handsome school building". Similarly, in the sentence At the age of eight, my family finally bought a dog,[3] the modifier At the age of eight "dangles": it is not attached to the subject of the main clause, and could imply that it was the family that was eight years old when it bought the dog, or even that the dog was eight when it was bought, rather than the intended meaning of giving the narrator's age at the time the family "finally bought a dog".

However, when the subject is missing or the clause attaches itself to another object in a sentence, the clause is seemingly "hanging" on nothing or on an entirely inappropriate noun. It thus "dangles", as in these sentences: Walking down Main Street, the trees were beautiful. Reaching the station, the sun came out. In the first sentence, the adjunct clause may at first appear to modify "the trees", the subject of the sentence. However, it actually modifies the speaker of the sentence, who is not explicitly mentioned. In the second sentence, the adjunct may at first appear to modify "the sun", the subject of the sentence. Presumably, there is another, human subject who did reach the station and observed the sun coming out, but since this subject is not mentioned in the text, the intended meaning is obscured, and therefore this kind of sentence is incorrect in standard English. Strunk and White's The Elements of Style provides another kind of example, a misplaced modifier (another participle): I saw the trailer peeking through the window. Presumably, this means the speaker was peeking through the window, but the placement of the clause "peeking through the window" makes it sound as though the trailer were doing so. The sentence can be recast as, "Peeking through the window, I saw the trailer." Similarly, in "She left the room fuming", it is conceivably the room, rather than "she", that was fuming, though it is unlikely that anybody besides a fumigator would interpret it this way. Strunk and White describe as "ludicrous" another of their examples (an "unclear on the concept" stab at the ablative absolute – see note below): "Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap." The author obviously meant the house was dilapidated, but the construction suggests that he (the speaker or writer, identified as "I") was dilapidated. Bernstein offers another ludicrous example: "Roaring down the track at seventy miles an hour, the stalled car was smashed by the train."[4] The adjunct is meant to modify "train": it is the train that is roaring down the track. But the subject of the main clause is "the stalled car". The writer is suggesting that the stalled car, which really isn't moving at all, is roaring down the track. The sentence could be rewritten more felicitously: "Roaring down the track at seventy miles an hour, the train smashed the stalled car." Or: "The stalled car was smashed by the train, roaring down the track at seventy miles an hour." Follett provides yet another ludicrous example: "Leaping to the saddle, his horse bolted."[5] But who leapt? Presumably the horseman – certainly not the horse, which was wearing the saddle. In this example, the noun or pronoun intended to be modified isn't even in the sentence. Unproblematic: "Leaping to the saddle, he made his horse bolt forward", or "As he leapt into the saddle, his horse bolted." (In the latter, the non-finite adjunct clause is replaced by a finite subordinate clause.) These examples illustrate a writing principle that dangling participles violate. Follett states the principle: "A participle at the head of a sentence automatically affixes itself to the subject of the following verb – in effect a requirement that the writer either make his [grammatical] subject consistent with the participle or discard the participle for some other construction."[5] Strunk and White put it this way: "A participle phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject."[6] Dangling participles should not be confused with clauses in absolute constructions, which are considered grammatical. Because the participle phrase in an absolute construction is not semantically attached to any single element in the sentence, it is easily confused with a dangling participle.[7] The difference is that a participle phrase is intended to modify a particular noun or pronoun, but is instead erroneously attached to a different noun, whereas an absolute clause is not intended to modify any noun at all. An example of an absolute construction is: The weather being beautiful, we plan to go to the beach today. Non-participial modifiers[edit] Non-participial modifiers that dangle can also be troublesome: After years of being lost under a pile of dust, Walter P. Stanley, III, left, found all the old records of the Bangor Lions Club.[8] The above sentence, from a newspaper article, suggests that it is the subject of the sentence, Walter Stanley, who was buried under a pile of dust, and not the records. It is the prepositional phrase "after years of being lost under a pile of dust" which dangles. In the film Mary Poppins, Mr. Dawes Sr. dies of laughter after hearing the following joke: "I know a man with a wooden leg called Smith." "What was the name of his other leg?" In the case of this joke, the placement of the phrase "called Smith" implies that it is the leg that is named Smith, rather than the man. Another famous example of this humorous effect is by Groucho Marx as Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding in the 1930 film Animal Crackers: One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I'll never know.[9] Though under the most plausible interpretation of the first sentence, Captain Spaulding would have been wearing the pajamas, the line plays on the grammatical possibility that the elephant was instead. Strunk and White offer this example: "As a mother of five, and with another on the way, my ironing board is always up."[10] Is the ironing board (grammatical subject) really the mother of five? Less ambiguous: "As the mother of five, and with another on the way, I always keep my ironing board up." Or: "My ironing board is always up, because I am a mother of five, with another on the way." Modifiers reflecting the mood or attitude of the speaker[edit] Participial modifiers can sometimes be intended to describe the attitude or mood of the speaker, even when the speaker is not part of the sentence. Some such modifiers are standard and are not considered dangling modifiers: "Speaking of [topic]", and "Trusting that this will put things into perspective", for example, are commonly used to transition from one topic to a related one or for adding a conclusion to a speech. Usage of "hopefully"[edit] Main article: Hopefully Since about the 1960s, controversy has arisen over the proper usage of the adverb hopefully.[11] Some grammarians object to constructions such as "Hopefully, the sun will be shining tomorrow."[12]:19 Their complaint is that the term "hopefully" ought to be understood as the manner in which the sun will shine. In order to modify the whole sentence to convey the attitude of the speaker, they say, the "hopefully" should be moved to the end: "the sun will be shining tomorrow, hopefully." "Hopefully" used in this way is a disjunct (cf. "admittedly", "mercifully", "oddly"). Disjuncts (also called sentence adverbs) are useful in colloquial speech for the concision they permit. No other word in English expresses that thought. In a single word we can say it is regrettable that (regrettably) or it is fortunate that (fortunately) or it is lucky that (luckily), and it would be comforting if there were such a word as hopably or, as suggested by Follett, hopingly, but there isn't. [...] In this instance nothing is to be lost – the word would not be destroyed in its primary meaning – and a useful, nay necessary term is to be gained.[13] What had been expressed in lengthy adverbial constructions, such as "it is regrettable that ..." or "it is fortunate that ...", had of course always been shortened to the adverbs "regrettably" or "fortunately". Bill Bryson says, "those writers who scrupulously avoid 'hopefully' in such constructions do not hesitate to use at least a dozen other words – 'apparently', 'presumably', 'happily', 'sadly', 'mercifully', 'thankfully', and so on – in precisely the same way."[14] Merriam-Webster gives a usage note on its entry for "hopefully"; the editors point out that the disjunct sense of the word dates to the early 18th century and has been in widespread use since at least the 1930s. Objection to this sense of the word, they state, became widespread only in the 1960s. The editors maintain that this usage is "entirely standard".[15] Yet the choice of "regrettably" above as a counterexample points out an additional problem. At the time that objection to "hopefully" became publicized, grammar books[vague] relentlessly pointed out the distinction between "regrettably" and "regretfully". The latter is not to be used as a sentence adverb, they state; it must refer to the subject of the sentence.[16] The misuse of "regretfully" produces worse undesired results than "hopefully", possibly contributing to disdain for the latter. The counterpart hopably was never added to the language. See also[edit] Double entendre Garden-path sentence Syntactic ambiguity References[edit] ^ McArthur, Tom, ed.

November 1863(1863-11-16) (aged 81)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchScientific careerFieldsMedicine, Social epidemiology, Sociology, Hygienic reform Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French economist and physician. He was known for his early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects of socioeconomic status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal in the history of the fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé published works on the conditions in prisons in France, and the benefits of helping prisoners return to outside life when their sentences ended. Another concerned the role of industrialization on the general health and quality of life of working-class people. His best-known work was concerned with workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries, including the children that worked in the mills. Contents 1 Career 2 Works 2.1 On Prisons 2.2 Tableau 2.3 The Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk Workers 3 References Career[edit] Born in Paris on 10 March 1782, Villermé was a man of many occupations; he covered a wide range of professions in his lifetime including: medical student, army surgeon, author, social economist, and member of several medical boards. He studied with the anatomist Guillaume Dupuytren during 1801–1804. Villermé then spent 10 years serving in the army room during 1804–1814 under the reign of Napoleon. In 1819, Villermé married. After his military service, he began work as Secretary-General of the Société Médicale d'Emulation in 1818. Villermé was elected to the Académie royale de médecine in 1823.[1] Later in life, he became an economist who wrote about social issues. Villermé was one of the pioneering advocates of hygienic reform and one of the first in France to relate hygienic reform with that of social reform. He conducted numerous early studies on social epidemiology, the health disparities among classes in correlation with wages and living conditions, using his knowledge as a physician to incorporate data analysis as well as social investigations of the working class.[1] He even conducted studies that related mortality rates with income.[1][2][3] He was described by Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet as "one of the men who has thrown most light upon this important subject."[4] He is considered one of the founders of epidemiology.[5] Villermé was responsible for the establishment in 1829[6]:44 of what may have been the first journal of urban studies, Annales d'hygiène publique et de médecine légale (Annals of Public Hygiene and Forensic Medicine, 1829).[7][8] As one of its editors, he advocated for the use of statistics as a tool, and published the works of statisticians from France and other countries.[6]:74 In addition to being a member of the Académie royale de médecine, Villermé was a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques after it was reestablished in 1832. He was appointed by it to lead a commission into textile workers,[9] and served as its president.[10] His work is considered pivotal in the history of the fields of sociology and statistical inquiry,[3] Politically, Villermé was a liberal, with an optimistic belief that industrialism and haut commerce could be sources of "productive" wealth which would improve public health.[11][12] In terms of political economy, he generally did not support government intervention or regulation, believing that a healthy private sector would self-regulate and that enlightened employers would provide higher wages.[13][14] He did not adopt a radical or proletarian view focused on class relations and political organizing.[13] However, in the area of child labor, Villermé was an active supporter of government intervention. He strongly advocated against child labor and for the required education of young children, positions that influenced the passage of comprehensive French child labor legislation in 1841.[13][15] If following my tour a maximum duration of work for children in factories should be adopted, I would certainly be well rewarded for all my trouble... This law, which would only be a copy of one passed in England not long ago, is absolutely demanded by conscience and humanity.[9] Works[edit] Louis-René Villermé at the age of 78, in 1860 or 1861 On Prisons[edit] Villermé published Des prisons telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On Prisons as They Are and as They Should Be) in 1820.[16][17] In this work he called attention to the unhealthy conditions of the prisons in Paris.[18] He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release.[19] This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.[20] In the year 1826, he conducted a study connecting mortality rates with wealth and poverty based on neighborhoods in Paris. Louis-René Villermé is also accounted as the author of the one of the first life expectancy tables that directly linked income to mortality rates and life expectancy. He concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into his study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter heights in poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition.[13] Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.[21] Tableau[edit] Villermé’s Tableau discussed the role of industrialization on the general health and quality of life for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also discussed the role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, at least half of the workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.[22][6] The Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk Workers[edit] His most popular work was that of Tableau de l'état physique et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation,[8] published in the year 1840.[23][24] The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults as well as the danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers.[25] There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding.[26] and he is considered a founder of epidemiology.[5][27] Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.[26][5] References[edit] ^ a b c Julia, C. (2011).

Over his 58-year tenure (1953–2011), Cristil called 636 football games (or roughly 63% of all football games played by Mississippi State) and 1,538 basketball games (or roughly 55% of all basketball games played by Mississippi State).[1] Contents 1 Early life and career 2 Retirement 3 Awards and achievements 4 References Early life and career[edit] Born in Memphis, Tennessee to Latvian and Russian Jewish[2] immigrants, Cristil listened to radio stations from Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Chicago at a young age and knew then he wanted to be a radio broadcaster.[3] In 1947, Cristil studied Broadcast Journalism at the University of Minnesota before moving back home to Memphis. Shortly thereafter, Cristil began his radio play-by-play career calling Minor League Baseball in various places such as Jackson, Tennessee; Anniston, Alabama; and Memphis, Tennessee. He then moved to Clarksdale, Mississippi, to call Clarksdale High School football games. Cristil submitted an audition tape to then MSU Athletic Director C.R. "Dudy" Noble in August 1953. In September 1953, Cristil began calling Mississippi State football games. His first play-by-play was a 34–6 Mississippi State win over the University of Memphis.[1] In that game, future SEC Player of the Year and All American, Art Davis would score the first touchdown Cristil ever called in his Mississippi State broadcasting career. On September 26, 1956 as Elvis Presley returned to Tupelo to perform two shows at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, he was interviewed, in between shows by Cristil. In 1957, Cristil began calling play-by-play for men's basketball. His first was a win over Union University in Jackson, Tennessee, the city where he began his broadcasting career.[1] Cristil was best known for ending a Bulldog victory by saying, "Wrap it in maroon and white!" Retirement[edit] Cristil announced his retirement after the men's basketball game against University of Tennessee on February 23, 2011. He cited health issues as his reason for stepping down after 58 years.[1] He addressed the fans after the broadcast for almost two minutes, expressing thanks and appreciation to the Mississippi State fan base.[citation needed] Jim Ellis, who had called Bulldog baseball since 1979, succeeded him. In 2011, Cristil was the lay leader of the Temple B'nai Israel in Tupelo, Mississippi.[4][5][6] Cristil died September 7, 2014, at the age of 88 at Sanctuary Hospice House in Tupelo of complications from kidney disease and cancer.[7] Awards and achievements[edit] Southeastern Conference Broadcaster of the Year – 1988 21 times named Mississippi Broadcaster of the Year 1991 Inductee of Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame Ronald Reagan Lifetime Achievement Award 1997 Chris Schenkel Award given by the College Football Hall of Fame References[edit] ^ a b c d "Legendary Voice Of The Bulldogs Jack Cristil To Conclude Career Saturday".

Many East Londoners by rigid slum clearance moved out into the new estates of the Home Counties (some of which is now outer Greater London). The study was carried out in the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, in the East End of London and a new housing estate in Essex. The research was carried out by Michael Young and Peter Willmott, who had been an integral part of building the welfare state in Britain during the tenure of Clement Attlee and the Labour government between 1945-51. The study itself has been acknowledged by many sociologists and in its authors' critiques as being one of the most influential sociological studies of the twentieth century.[1] It is argued by some[who?] that it has inspired British sociology to take new paths away from the more traditional broad Functionalist versus Marxist dichotomy. It used social observation as its means to do so, going away from statistical information that had been previously preferred. In this sense, it counters the Structuralist (Positivist) model that posits statistics can always be found to prove cause and effect within society. The idea was to interact and understand a post-war community, to determine its aspirations, worries, doubts and insecurities. This key understanding moves the study into a more Interactionist line, about each individual's role within society. Indeed, it could also be linked to Max Weber's idea of empathy and "going deep" to comprehend the complexity of communities. In 1992, Michael Young and the Institute of Community Studies he founded commenced on a new survey of the area to examine the changes to the area and in particular to examine the conflict between the white working class and Bangladeshi immigrants which had become a major feature of the area. This was eventually published in 2005 after his death as The New East End: Kinship, Race and Conflict by Michael Young, Kate Gavron, Geoff Dench. On Wednesday 25 April 2007, The Guardian society section reported on the 50th Anniversary of the study. Madeleine Bunting expressed how "the voices they found described a world rich in social relationships, networks of dependence and mutual support that were central to the people's resilience in facing the adversity of insecure and low paid employment." Bunting also mentions how the pair were amongst the first to discover "social capital" and its role in shaping community life. It was the first British sociological study that really investigated deeply people's attitudes, beliefs and feelings. Using detailed prose and limited statistical analysis, it charted how decisions from the top affected ordinary people in their day-to-day and prospective lives.

The club currently plays in the Malaysia Premier League, the second division of the Malaysian League. The club was founded as T-Team on 14 July 2006, changed its name to Terengganu II in 2017 and become the reserve team of Terengganu Football Club. The club is widely known as The Turtles.

The club was formed after Football Association of Kuala Terengganu District decided to send a football team to compete in Malaysian League as T-Team. They competed in 2008 Malaysia FAM League and achieved promotion to Malaysia Premier League for 2009 season.[1] The club was then also promoted to Malaysia Super League after just one season in second division and then competed in 2010 Malaysia Super League. The club was further rebranded as T-Team Titans to gather local support. The team quickly gained popularity among the local football fans as everyone's favourite underdog. As the team kept surpassing the pundits' and supporters' expectations season after season they also showed that they were more than capable of competing and beating Malaysia's heavyweights (JDT, Pahang and Kedah) even with their tight budget and often young squad. Merging with Terengganu FA to become Terengganu FC[edit] On 21 November 2017, T-Team management announced the club had been absorbed into Terengganu F.C., and the team status was changed to a reserve team of the newly restructured first team of Terengganu. As part of the change, T-Team changed its name to Terengganu II, and were automatically relegated to the 2018 Malaysia Premier League, despite finishing the season outside of the 2017 Malaysia Super League relegation zone.[2] This was a controversial decision among Terengganu and Malaysia football fans as they felt that the decision was very unfair towards the club and the players of T-Team (currently Terengganu F.C II) at that time. As the club worked hard until the last day of the season to avoid relegation to the Malaysia Premier League but still ended up getting relegated due to the decision of the board. The fans felt that there was no need for the two clubs to merge as they would have preferred T-Team to exist as their club and management and be able to watch a Terengganu Derby in the Malaysia Super League between Terengganu F.C. I versus T-Team. Coach Rahmad Darmawan openly criticized the decision of the Terengganu F.C. board as he felt that he and his players were betrayed. He stated that had the decision of merging the two clubs been announced before the start of the season, he and his players would not have wasted their time and energy to avoid relegation. He then resigned as the coach of Terengganu F.C. II with the reason that he was not interested in managing a reserve side. Under new head coach, Mustafa Kamal, Terengganu II performed badly in the league, and finished 11th, in the automatic relegation to Malaysia FAM League zone. As a result of the poor performance, Mustafa Kamal resigned as head coach, and the head coach role were temporarily held by Tengku Hazman, his assistant, for the inaugural Malaysia Challenge Cup. Tengku Hazman succeeded in leading his charges to win the tournament, beating UKM F.C. 4-2 on aggregate in the final.

Contents 1 Disappearance 2 Investigation 3 Further reading 4 See also 5 References Disappearance[edit] On the night of October 18, 1949, Dorothy's husband, magistrate Jules Forstein, left home for the evening. He later called Dorothy and told her that he would not arrive home until late. When he returned home, he was very surprised to find his two children, Edward and Marcy, clinging together in a bedroom. They were both crying "Mommy's gone!" Marcy told her father that roughly 15 minutes previously, she had been woken by a noise and had gone downstairs, where she had seen a middle-aged man in a brown, peaked cap carrying her unconscious mother down the stairs over his shoulder. When she asked him what he was doing, he patted her head and told her, "Go back to sleep, little one. Your mom is fine."[1] from Marcel Dassault's account[2][3][4] and he then left and locked the door.[5] Investigation[edit] Police initially doubted Marcy's story but believed it after a psychiatrist interviewed her and confirmed she was apparently telling the truth. The theory first posited by police was that someone with a grudge against her husband due to his job had targeted her. This was seen as most likely given that five years previously, a home intruder had stolen nothing but had severely assaulted Dorothy. On this occasion, too, nothing was stolen from the house.[3] No fingerprints were left behind by the intruder, nor were there any signs of forced entry, just as in the previous assault.[3] A large search was conducted to find Forstein, as the police asked for a check of all unidentified women and requested reports from hospitals (including mental hospitals), hotels, morgues and convalescent homes all across the country.[3] Captain James Kelly of Philadelphia's detective bureau sent out 10,000 notices to police departments and institutions with the description of Forstein.[6] Further reading[edit] Boar, Roger; Blundell, Nigel (2012).

Synonyms Fagraea cochinchinensis Cyrtophyllum giganteum Cyrtophyllum peregrinum In the Kandy botanic garden, Sri Lanka The tembusu (Malay for Fagraea fragrans) is a large evergreen tree in the family Gentianaceae, native to Southeast Asia. Its trunk is dark brown, with deeply fissured bark, looking somewhat like a bittergourd. The tree grows in an irregular shape from 10 to 25 metres high,[1] with light green oval-shaped leaves, and yellowish flowers with a distinct fragrance. The fruits of the tree are bitter tasting red berries, which are eaten by Pteropus fruit bats.[2] Contents 1 Common names 2 Uses 3 Cultural significance 4 References 5 External links Common names[edit] Buabua (Fiji Islands), Urung (Philippines), Temasuk (Sabah), Tatrao, Trai (Vietnam), Kan Krao (Thailand), Tembesu (Indonesia), Anan, Anama (Burma), Munpla (Thailand, Laos), Ta Trao (Cambodia). Uses[edit] The trunk of this tree can produce very hard wood that can be used to make chopping boards. The wood can last over a hundred years, particularly as termites and weevils do not eat this kind of wood. People always use this wood for creating the floors of their homes and love to sleep on it. Cultural significance[edit] The tree is pictured on the Singaporean five-dollar bill. In Thailand, it is the provincial tree of Surin Province and the university tree of Ubonratchathani.

Washington Avenue in Hubbardston, Michigan. The church was built in 1868. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places and listed as a Michigan State Historic Site in 2001.[1] The parish is clustered with St. Mary parish in Carson City, Michigan.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Description 3 External links 4 References History[edit] John Cowman, who settled near here in 1849, is likely the first Irish Catholic immigrant in the area. By 1851, six other families had settled nearby, and Fr. George Godez, pastor at Westphalia, began making pastoral visits. In 1853, a small chapel was built on the Cowman farm. More settlers arrived over the next few years, and in 1855 the parish of St. John the Baptist on Fish Creek was established, with Fr. Charles Bolte appointed pastor. By this time the settlement of Hubbardston, which had started with a sawmill, was well underway. Commercial buildings began to appear in 1855, and the village itself was platted in 1865.[3] By the 1860s, the original St. John the Baptist had been enlarged several times, but the congregation was still outgrowing the space. Additionally, the location outside the village was becoming inconvenient. In 1868, the parish purchased a plot in Hubbardston and began construction of this church. The building was completed in 1869, and was at the time the largest church building in the county. A parish school was started in 1883, using a former public school building located across the street from the church. The cemetery near the original church location was used until 1884, when the cemetery near the present church was opened. A new rectory, designed by Detroit architects Donaldson and Meier, was built in 1907-08. A school designed by the same firm was built in 1917, replacing the previous building.[3] However, the school ceased function in 1965. The last parish priest retired in 2005, and the parish is clustered with St. Mary parish in Carson City.[4] Description[edit] The St. John the Baptist Catholic Church complex stands atop high ground at the edge of Hubbardston. The complex includes the church proper, a rectory, a garage, a school, and a cemetery, along with a contemporary parish center.[3] The church is a rectangular, wood-frame Gothic Revival building with a slate gable roof on a fieldstone foundation. It is clad with clapboard and has tall pointed arch windows. The front facade is symmetrical, with a central, partly projecting square plan entry tower. A belfry with paired Gothic openings sits atop the tower. The interior contains two tiers of seventeen pews flanking a central aisle; the furnishings date from the 1940s-60s.[3] The rectory is a two-story hip-roof, red brick building with symmetrical five-bay facade on a random ashlar basement. The school is a two-story, rectangular, brick-walled building on a random ashlar basement. A partly projecting tower in the center of the front facade has arches giving it a vaguely Italian look. A 1960s one-story, flat-roof addition is attached to one side. The in-use section of the cemetery measures 400 feet by 350 feet, and includes large hemlocks, oaks, and other trees. Cemetery grounds include a variety of nineteenth and twentieth century monuments, as well as a small stone gable-front receiving vault.[3] External links[edit] St. Mary / St. John the Baptist parishes website St. John the Baptist, Hubbardston from the Diocese of Grand Rapids References[edit] ^ a b "National Register Information System".

The mountains are also referred to as Saxon Switzerland and Bohemian Switzerland in both German and Czech (Sächsische Schweiz and Böhmische Schweiz in German, Saské Švýcarsko and České Švýcarsko in Czech) or simply combined as Saxon-Bohemian Switzerland.[3] In both countries, core parts of the mountain range have been declared a national park. The name derives from the sandstone which was carved by erosion. The river Elbe breaks through the mountain range in a steep and narrow valley. Contents 1 Geography 1.1 Extent 1.2 Terrain 1.3 Geology 2 Conservation 3 Tourism 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Geography[edit] Extent[edit] The Elbe Sandstone Mountains extend on both sides of the Elbe from the Saxon town of Pirna in the northwest toward Bohemian Děčín in the southeast. Their highest peak with 723 m (2,372 ft) is the Děčínský Sněžník in Bohemian Switzerland on the left bank of the river in Bohemian Switzerland north of Děčín. The mountain range links the Ore Mountains in the west with the Lusatian Highlands range of the Sudetes in the east. Saxon Switzerland and the Zittau Mountains of the Lusatian Mountains form the Saxon-Bohemian Chalk Sandstone Region. The Elbe valley in Bohemian Switzerland. The mountains on the horizon lie in Saxony Terrain[edit] The most striking characteristic of this deeply dissected rocky mountain range is the extraordinary variety of terrain within the smallest area. Unique amongst the Central European Uplands are the constant changes between plains, ravines, table mountains and rocky regions with undeveloped areas of forest. This diversity is ecologically significant. The variety of different locations, each with its own conditions in terms of soil and microclimate, has produced an enormous richness of species. The numbers of ferns and mosses alone is unmatched by any other of the German central uplands. The occurrence of Elbe sandstones and hence the Elbe Sandstone Mountains themselves is related to widespread deposition by a former sea in the Upper Cretaceous epoch. On the Saxon side of the border the term "Elbe Valley Cretaceous" (Elbtalkreide) is used, referring to a region stretching from Meißen-Oberau in the northwest through Dresden and Pirna into Saxon Switzerland, and which is formed by sandstones, planers and other rocks as well as basal conglomerates (Grundschottern or Basalkonglomerate) of older origin. Several erosion relics from Reinhardtsgrimma through Dippoldiswalde and the Tharandt Forest to Siebenlehn form isolated examples south of Dresden. They are mainly characterised by sandstones. On the Bohemian side the sandstone beds continue and form part of the North Bohemian Cretaceous (Nordböhmische Kreide). The chalk sediments of the Zittau Basin are counted as part of the latter due to their regional-geological relationships. The sedimentary sequences of the Cretaceous sea continue across a wide area of the Czech Republic to Moravia. Together these beds form the Saxon-Bohemian Cretaceous Zone. In Czech geological circles, the Elbe Valley Cretaceous is described as the foothills of the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin[3] (Böhmischen Kreidebecken). Geology[edit] Hercules pillars in the Biela valley The eroded sandstone landscape of this region was formed from depositions that accumulated on the bottom of the sea millions of years ago. Large rivers carried sand and other eroded debris into the Cretaceous sea. Rough quartz sand, clay and fine marl sank and became lithified layer by layer. A compact sandstone sequence developed, about 20 x 30 kilometres wide and up to 600 metres thick dating to the lower Cenomanian to Santonian stages.[3] The tremendous variety of shapes in the sandstone landscape is a result of the subsequent chemical and physical erosion and biological processes acting on the rocks formed from those sands laid down during the Cretaceous Period. The inlets of a Cretaceous sea, together with marine currents, carried away sand over a very long period of time into a shallow zone of the sea and then the diagenetic processes at differing pressure regimes resulted in the formation of sandstone beds. Its stratification is characterized by variations in the horizontal structure (deposits of clay minerals, grain sizes of quartz, differences in the grain-cement) as well as a typical but fairly small fossil presence and variably porous strata. After the Cretaceous sea had retreated (marine regression), the surface of the land was shaped by weathering influences and watercourses, of which the Elbe made the deepest incision. Later the Lusatian granodiorite was uplifted over the 600 metre thick sandstone slab along the Lusatian Fault and pushed it downwards until it fractured. This northern boundary of the sandstone deposit lies roughly along the line Pillnitz–Hohnstein–Hinterhermsdorf–Krásná Lípa (Schönlinde). Crags near Rathen In the Tertiary period, the adjacent region of the Central Bohemian Uplands and the Lusatian Mountains was shaped and affected by intense volcanism; but individual intrusions of magma also forced their way through the sandstone platform of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The most striking evidence of this phase in the earth's history are the conical basaltic hills of Růžovský vrch (Rosenberg), Cottaer Spitzberg and Raumberg, but also Großer and Kleiner Winterberg. At its southwestern edge the sandstone plate was uplifted by over 200 metres at the Karsdorf Fault, whereby the slab was tilted even more and increased the gradient of the Elbe River. The water masses cut valleys into the rock with their streambeds and contributed in places to the formation of the rock faces. Over time the gradients reduced, the streambed of the Elbe widened out and changed its course time and again, partly as a result of the climatic influences of the ice ages. The mineral composition of the sandstone beds has a direct effect on the morphology of the terrain. The fine-grained form with clayey-silty cement between the quartz grains causes banks and slopes with terracing. The beds of sandstone with siliceous cement are typically the basis of the formation of rock faces and crags. Small variations in the cement composition of the rock can have a visible impact on the landscape.[4] Elbe Sandstone gets its characteristic cuboid appearance from its thick horizontal strata (massive bedding) and its vertical fissures. In 1839 Bernhard Cotta wrote about this in his comments on the geognostic map: "Vertical fissures and cracks cut through, often virtually at right angles, the horizontal layers and, as a result, parallelepiped bodies are formed, that have given rise to the description Quader Sandstone.".[5] Quader is German for an ashlar or block of stone, hence the name "Square Sandstone" is also used in English.[6] The term quader sandstone mountains or square sandstone mountains (Quadersandsteingebirge), introduced by Hanns Bruno Geinitz in 1849, is an historic, geological term for similar sandstone deposits, but was also used in connection with the Elbe Sandstone Mountains.[7][8] Honeycomb weathering The fissures were formed as a result of long-term tectonic stresses on the entire sandstone platform of the mountain range. This network of clefts runs through the sandstone beds in a relatively regular way, but in different directions in two regions of the range.[9] Subsequent weathering processes of very different forms and simultaneous complex deposition (leaching, frost and salt wedging, wind, solution weathering with sintering as well as biogenic and microbial effects) have further changed the nature of the rock surface. For example, collapse caves, small hole-like cavities (honeycomb weathering) with hourglass-shaped pillars (Sanduhr), chimneys, crevices and mighty, rugged rock faces. Many morphological formations in the rocky landscape of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are suspected to have been formed as a consequence of karstification. Important indicators of such processes in the polygenetic and polymorphic erosion landscape of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are the furrows with parallel ridges between them (grykes and clints) that look like cart ruts and which are particularly common, as well as extensive cave systems. They are occasionally described by the term pseudokarst. The application of the concept to several erosion formations in the sandstone of this mountain range is however contentious.[10][11][12][13][14] Czech geologists have identified in quartzite-cemented sandstone areas in the northern part of the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin, karst features in the shape of spherical caverns and cave formations. According to them, these emerged as a result of solution processes by water in complex interactions with iron compounds from neighbouring or intrusive magmatic-volcanic rocks. The variation in relief in these sandstone regions is explained on the basis of these processes.[15][16] The Elbe Sandstone Mountains are the greatest cretaceous sandstone erosion complex in Europe.[17] Human-induced changes caused by nearly 1,000 years of continual sandstone quarrying have also contributed in parts of the sandstone highlands to the appearance of the landscape today. The fissures (called Loose by the quarrymen) played an important role here, because they provided in effect natural divisions in the rock that were helpful when demolishing a rock face or when dressing the rough blocks of stone.[18] The sandstone of this region is a sought-after building material used for example, for imposing city edifices such as the Church of Our Lady in Dresden. Conservation[edit] Large parts of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are under statutory protection. In Germany there is the national park region of Saxon Switzerland, which consists two elements: the Saxon Switzerland National Park itself, founded in 1990 and covered an area of 93 km²; and the protected area surrounding it that was founded in 1956 and covers 287 km². The German part of the range was also designated in May 2006 as one of the 77 most important national geotopes in Germany by the Academy of Geosciences in Hanover. In the Bohemian part of the range there has been a nature reserve in the northeastern region since 1972 called the Elbe Sandstone Protected Area (Chráněná krajinná oblast Labské pískovce) with an area of 324 km². In 2000, the Bohemian Switzerland National Park (Národní park České Švýcarsko) was established with an area of 79 km², bringing around 700 km² of the range under protection as a natural and cultural landscape. Tourism[edit] The Pravčická brána (Prebischtor), a natural sandstone arch in Bohemian Switzerland The Bastei bridge in Saxon Switzerland The Elbe Sandstone mountains have been a popular destination for tourists for more than 200 years, and for climbers for more than 100 years. It is also a popular recreation area for the nearby Saxon capital Dresden. Places of interest include the Bastei cliffs near Rathen, the Königstein Fortress, Pravčická brána, the Schrammsteine, Pfaffenstein, and the valleys of the Kirnitzsch and Kamenice rivers. There are some 14,000 climbing routes via which mountain climbers can conquer 1100 free-standing peaks. Visitors can experience the natural scenes on the asphalt Elbe cycle path, or on board a steam paddleboat that is part of the oldest fleet of its kind in the world. The Elbe Sandstone Mountains have numerous facilities for cure and rehabilitation. The region has a tradition of many years. The discovery of ferrous and sulphurous sources in Bad Schandau in 1730 led to its development as a health resort and the building of swimming baths.

(Michael and Ellen had emigrated from County Clare, Ireland and married in Dundas on May 11, 1854 with Cornelius Sexton and Elizabeth Connors witnesses.) John Sexton worked in a general store in Niagara, Ontario 1874–1877. He immigrated to Chicago in 1877 at 18 and began working for various wholesale grocers in Chicago as a clerk and city salesman. During this time, he realized that there was an opportunity to specialize in selling quality teas, coffees and spices. John Sexton married Anna Louise Bartleman (born May 22, 1866 Chicago) on August 11, 1886 in Chicago. (Anna Louise's parents, Christian and Theresa (Albrecht) Bartleman had emigrated from Saxe-Coburg Gotha, Germany in the mid-1850s.) The couple had five children: Thomas George (born February 21, 1889 Chicago ), Franklin (born 2/16/1891), Sherman J. (born 9/12/1892), Helen (Egan) (b.?) and Ethel (Marten) (born 1896). The family home was at 2238 North Dayton Street in Chicago. All three sons and both sons-in-law worked for the company in various roles. John Sexton & Co. established[edit] In 1883, at the age of 25, John Sexton invested his entire life savings of $400 and formed a corporation with George A. Hitchcock, the Hitchcock & Sexton Company, which opened a small office at 5 Wabash in downtown Chicago. Within a year, Hitchcock & Sexton moved to 20 State Street (at State and Lake) which was owned by John DeKoven.[1] As business increased, Hitchcock & Sexton opened three more retail stores in the Chicago area, including one in Joliet. This made Hitchcock & Sexton one of the first retail coffee and tea chain proprietors in the United States. In 1886, Hitchcock sold Sexton his interest in the business and renamed the company John Sexton & Co. To help run the business, John Sexton recruited his sisters Mary (Barton); Sarah (O'Leary); Brigid "Bea" (Mulligan), who later married widower Francis Upton; and his younger brother James J. Sexton to move to Chicago from Dundas, Ontario. The sisters each ran one of his retail stores and lived above it with their families. In addition to family, John Sexton relied on recruiting high-quality employees by offering attractive wages, sales commissions and fair dealing. As word spread of Sexton's quality products, fair dealings and unconditional guarantee, restaurant and hotel customers came to the Sexton retail stores to buy spices, tea and coffee. Sexton also added dried and canned goods to his stores. In addition, he began to call on the Chicago restaurants and hotels directly. He hired salesmen and delivery drivers to service on the wholesale accounts, and purchased horses and wagons to make deliveries. By 1888, Sexton decided to close his four retail stores and focus solely on his Chicago wholesale customers. He expanded the State Street store by renting the rest of the building. John Sexton & Co., State Street, Chicago, first location, April 17, 1897 In 1890, Sexton established an institutional department to call on hospitals, colleges, schools, railroad dining cars and orphanages around the country. These customers required consistent quality products that were available in sufficient quantity all year long. Sexton developed an extensive product line as well as a distribution network based in Chicago. To call on the institutional market throughout the country, he recruited commission-based salesmen in the major urban markets of Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.. In addition to the major urban markets, Sexton recruited regional commission-based salesmen to call on customers who required quality groceries in large quantity to feed their clients or work force, but were far from major metropolitan areas. Regional salesmen called on lumbermen, ranchers, miners and grain farmers who had large work forces to feed. These salesmen would also call on hotels, restaurants, hotels, hospitals, schools and orphanages. To further establish the Sexton brand, he advertised in specific hospital and institutional dietician publications. The most effective marketing was at professional trade conventions where Sexton Quality Foods would sponsor a tasting booth featuring its products. Institutional customers could sample products and Sexton salesmen could develop contacts and sales leads. This proved enormously successful since no other grocery company at the time was effectively servicing this huge market. The 1893 Chicago's World Fair provided a chance to showcase Sexton's ability to deliver quality food in large quantity to meet the demand of the huge influx of tourist into Chicago.

The company directors were John Sexton, President; Dan E. Upton (cousin), Vice President, Harold R. White, Secretary; and William M. O'Leary (nephew), Treasurer. John Sexton & Co. letterhead depicting Lake and Franklin building, 1910. As John Sexton & Co. grew, the Sexton name became synonymous with quality products, fair dealings, uniform consistent food quality and unconditional guarantee. A bronze plaque hung in the building lobby read "All who come here to buy or sell fairly are always welcome." Some of the original brand names used by Sexton included Calumet, LaSalle, Pride of the West, Pyramid and Edelweiss. The most lasting innovation pioneered by John Sexton & Co. was the 1 gallon #10 can. Hailed as the perfect restaurant pack size, the #10 can was sanitary, economical and revolutionized kitchen storage since it was easy to lift, easy to open, stacked well and did not require refrigeration. The #10 can is still the industry standard. John Sexton & Co. fair dealings 1906. At the end of 1907, John Sexton & Co. had 125 employees in Chicago, a large Chicago customer base serviced by a city sales force, a national customer base serviced by a regional sales force, and a strong rural mail order trade. Sexton had outgrown the State Street location, so moved the company four blocks west to the corner of Lake and Franklin Streets (236 W. Lake Street). In 1908, Sexton Quality Foods leased the entire six-story building for a term of 10 years that expired April 1918. Prior to moving in, electric service and elevators were installed. A side note in Chicago real estate history, in 1885, J.B. Clow & Sons, a cast iron pipe manufacturer entered into a 99-year ground lease with landowner John Peacock at a rate of $3,000 per year with 4% annual increases. That same year, J.B. Clow & Sons constructed a six-story office building. In 1908, J.B. Clow & Sons relocated to a larger building at Harrison and the River and leased the building to John Sexton & Co. By 1909, John Peacock's widow sold the ground to George L. Thatcher for $173,000.[2] John Sexton & Co. organized the building into sales, warehouse, manufacturing and laboratory. At the new location, Sexton expanded into the manufacture of pickles, relishes, spices and preserves. Company horses were stabled at a livery one mile west of the building. Modernization[edit] John Sexton & Co. building on the corner of Illinois and Orleans, 300,000 square feet (28,000 m2) Chicago, 1915. Sexton drivers pose with new city delivery fleet made up of all electric trucks on the west side of the Sexton Building on the corner of Illinois and Orleans Streets in the River North area of Chicago, 1924. By 1912, Sexton had outgrown the Lake and Franklin location. In 1913, Sexton purchased a 1-acre (4,000 m2) parcel of land on the north side of the Chicago River on the corner of Illinois and Orleans Streets. The majority of Sexton's customers at that time were not in Chicago. Access to the railroads was critical to growing the business. Institutional customers throughout the country would order groceries by the railcar from Sexton Quality Foods, and Sexton wanted his new building to be able to receive and dispatch rail shipments directly. In 1913, construction of a 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2), six-story, fire sprinkler-protected, multi-use building designed by architect Alfred S. Alschuler was started. John Sexton & Co. leadership in 1914. Front row, left to right: Franklin Sexton, Dan Upton, John Sexton, Sherman Sexton, Harold R. White. Second row, left to right: Edmund Egan, William O'Leary, Thomas G. Sexton. In 1915, Sexton moved into the new building that housed the corporate offices, sales offices, country division, dry goods warehouse, food laboratory, refrigeration plant, and the Sexton Quality Foods manufacturing division, the Sunshine Kitchens, which produced private label sauces, soups and specialty products exclusively sold under the John Sexton & Co. banner. The first floor was divided into railcar receiving, railcar shipping, country parcel shipping, city delivery and city receiving. The building was large enough to unload three railcars simultaneously. By 1921, Sexton had established distribution warehouses in San Francisco, Dallas and Omaha. This was done partly to improve customer service by reducing the time between order and delivery. In addition, a majority of canned fruits, jellies and preserves were grown and packed on the west coast. Considerable freight expense could be saved by dividing the products according to regional demand. These warehouses would later become important branches for Sexton Quality Foods.[3] In 1924, John Sexton decided to modernize the company's city delivery fleet by purchasing 26 electric trucks from The Commercial Truck Company of America in Philadelphia,[4] and purchasing six gasoline-powered, 1.5 ton, six-wheeled trucks manufactured by Diamond T of Chicago. The modernization retired 50 horses, 35 grocery wagons and saved $12,000 in the first year.[5] Each CT electric truck averaged 12 miles (19 km) per delivery day, and were extremely reliable, easy to drive and well adapted for city deliveries.[6] However, in cold weather, their batteries were less efficient and the hard rubber tires had poor traction on snow-covered streets. The result was a diminished range for the electric trucks. The electric trucks were in service until the late 1930s and were gradually phased out as the Chicago area expanded into the suburbs, the delivery route mileage increased, the roads got better and commercial truck reliability improved. The six Diamond T Trucks were used for suburban Chicago deliveries and averaged 180 miles (290 km) each per delivery day in 1924. Sexton's mail order catalog 1927 In 1897, Sexton Quality Foods began publishing a mail order catalog, targeted to rural customers, and selling food and farm supplies. Orders were shipped from Chicago via rail to regional terminals where railway express would make the final delivery to the customer. Sexton Quality Foods' catalog business was an important division for years. It was ultimately led by Sexton's second oldest son, Franklin, who later led the coffee and tea division and became the company treasurer. Known as the "Country Division", the majority of the products sold were coffee, spices, flour, canned fruits and canned vegetables. However, paint, motor oil, nails, roof tar and canvas were also sold. The Sexton Country Division flourished until automobiles became affordable and rural automobile ownership increased. Rural customers were then more likely to drive to town to make frequent smaller purchases rather than place large orders from Chicago. The last country division catalog was published in the late 1930s. National expansion[edit] In 1928, at age 70, John Sexton stepped down as president of Sexton Quality Foods but remained its chairman. He asked his sons, Thomas, Franklin, and Sherman, who should lead the company. All agreed that Sherman was the best choice, and he became president of the company in 1928. Franklin remained the treasurer and Thomas remained vice president of merchandising. In 1930, at age 71, John Sexton died while on vacation in Los Angeles.[7] After his death, the ownership of the company was divided between John Sexton's wife Annie Louise (33%) and their children Thomas (13.3%), Franklin (13.3%), Sherman (13.3%), Helen (13.3%) and Ethel (13.3%).[8] By late 1931, the John Sexton & Co. leadership was as follows: Annie Louise (Bartleman) Sexton, Chairman; Sherman J. Sexton, President (Sales and Advertising); Harold R. White, Vice President (Canned and Dried Foods); Franklin Sexton, Secretary (Tea and Coffee); and Edmund A. Egan, Treasurer (Maintenance and Operation). In 1933, Sexton Foods opened its first distribution center outside Chicago by renting a warehouse in Brooklyn and buying a delivery fleet of five Diamond T trucks dedicated to the New York market. The New York sales office was then supported by a regional distribution network that could provide next-day delivery. The same year, the first Sexton professional salesman training school was established, led by Henry A. Marten, husband of Ethel. Sexton Quality Foods expanded its print advertising to the restaurant, college, hospital and food service trade publications in order to directly reach their customers. In addition, Sexton Quality Foods had a sales booth at all major trade conference for hospital administrators, college dietitians and restaurant associations. Sexton also published the first Sexton Cookbook in 1937, with two subsequent cookbooks published in 1941 and 1950. These compiled large-quantity recipes that Sexton customers had developed. Sexton Quality Foods frequently published pamphlets with menu ideas, food suggestions and business hints. Sexton Quality also published annual hardcover diaries that featured customers' recipes. In January 1941, the company expanded by opening a branch warehouse and truck fleet in Dallas, at 411 Elm Street, the later Texas School Book Depository. In November 1961, Sexton left the building for a modern single-story facility in the Brook Hollow Industrial District located at 650 Regal Row, Dallas, Texas. The Dallas branch would receive railcars of groceries from suppliers, canners and the Sexton Quality Foods Manufacturing Divisions. In 1941, Sexton introduced a line of frozen fruits and vegetables. The frozen food line was discontinued in mid-1942 due to the United States entering World War II and the need for Sexton to focus on providing groceries to the war effort. In August 1943, John Sexton & C.o purchased the J.C. Stewart Company, an institutional wholesaler, coffee roaster and spice blender located in Pittsburgh. Stewart Company had annual sales of $2 million, had extensive coffee roasting facilities, and was a leading processor of maraschino cherries and spices. Sexton relocated all coffee and spice blending operations to Pittsburgh. The investment banking firm of Floyd D. Cerf Company of Chicago represented Sexton in the transaction.[9] By 1943, Sexton had the ability to supply, manufacture and distribute large amounts of institutional groceries from its warehouses in Chicago, Brooklyn, Dallas and Pittsburgh. In 1946, Sexton purchased a six-story 110,000-square-foot (10,000 m2) building from stationery supplier Deeps, Inc. The building was located at 32-04 Northern Boulevard, Long Island City, New York and had been originally constructed for the Standard Radiator Co.[10] As World War II ended, the third generation returned from war service and began working for the company. During this time, there were three sons, two son-laws, many cousins and over 25 grandsons working for Sexton Quality Foods. By 1949, John Sexton & Co. was operating branch warehouses in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Long Island City, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Territories served by a Sexton salesman, but too remote from a Sexton branch warehouse, received rail shipments directly from Chicago. The majority of Sexton manufacturing was still done at the Chicago facility. However, the chemical manufacturing plant had moved to Philadelphia. The coffee roasting and spice blending operations had moved to Pittsburgh. In 1950, Sexton Quality Foods leased a 130,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) warehouse in San Francisco to support the established west coast sales force and to expand into California, Oregon and Washington.[11] On December 29, 1951, John Sexton's widow, Annie Louise Sexton, 90 years of age, chairman of John Sexton & Company, died in Miami Beach. At the time of her death, she had 5 children, 25 grandchildren and 62 great-grandchildren. She is buried next to her husband at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois. In January 1953, Sexton purchased the Columbia Conserve Company, a food manufacturer located in Indianapolis. The Sunshine Kitchens relocated to the newly purchased facility. However, Indianapolis grocery orders were still shipped from Chicago. This was because each night, up to six Sexton trucks from the Indianapolis facility would deliver Sexton-manufactured products to the Chicago warehouse and return with the next day's Indianapolis orders. In October 1953, five grandsons were elected to the board of directors: John S. Marten of Indianapolis, Alfred Egan of Dallas, John P. Sexton of Philadelphia, Thomas W. Sexton of Chicago and William C. Sexton of Chicago. Franklin Sexton, Thomas G. Sexton, Edmund Egan remained as board members. At the close of 1953, Harold R. White, Vice President (Canned and Dried Foods) retired after 50 years with the company. Harold was the leading authority on canned and dried foods in the wholesale grocery industry and oversaw Sexton's food quality standards and laboratory. Ora Chidester was elected Vice President (Canned and Dried Foods). Matthew Theis, Vice President (Manufacturing) retired after 50 years with the company. Harry P. Gaugham was elected Vice President (Manufacturing). Franklin Sexton retired as secretary of the company after 47 years of service, but remained a board member. Stanley Wojteczko, company controller was elected secretary of company.[12] In early 1955, Sexton announced plans to sell the Illinois and Orleans building and construct a new 175,000-square-foot (16,300 m2) warehouse on 7 acres (28,000 m2) at 47th Street and Kilbourne Avenue on the south side. The new warehouse would house the distribution and sales office for Chicago. All food manufacturing was relocated to Indianapolis and the existing Indianapolis plant was enlarged.[13] The John Sexton & Co. building on the corner of Illinois and Orleans was converted to condominiums in the mid-1990s. The terra cotta "JS & Co" logos in the brickwork are still visible. During the 1950s, Sexton Quality Foods experienced rapid growth as the nation began to dine out more and food service customers demanded quality and consistent products and timely deliveries. By 1958, the company's 75th anniversary, Sexton had a coast-to-coast distribution network with warehouses, sales operations and truck fleets located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco to service over 50,000 customers. Leadership succession[edit] On March 13, 1956, 63-year-old Sherman Sexton died unexpectedly of an aneurysm. He is buried at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines. Sherman had begun work for his father at the Lake and Franklin location as a Teamster in 1909 and his career had spanned 47 years. Sherman had led the company from a Chicago-based grocery mail order house to a coast-to-coast foodservice distributor with over $40 million in sales.[14] His untimely death created enormous turmoil since there was no clear succession for company leadership. 65-year-old Thomas G. Sexton stepped in as president.[15] Brothers Thomas, Franklin and Sherman had all joined the Teamsters Union on the same day in 1909. Tom had been vice president in charge of merchandising since 1926. In late 1956, Beatrice Foods approached Thomas G. Sexton and Ethel Marten (daughter of John Sexton) with an offer to purchase John Sexton & Co.; both declined.[16] In March 1959, the board of directors held a special election for a new company president. The four candidates were Thomas G. Sexton, Thomas Webb Sexton (son of Thomas G.), John S. Marten (son of Ethel) and Thomas Mackin ("Mack") Sexton (son of Franklin). Mack Sexton won the vote and became president in 1959. Thomas G. Sexton became chairman of the board.[17][18] Again, Beatrice approached John Sexton & Co. with an offer to purchase the company; Mack Sexton declined the offer.[19] Sexton goes public[edit] On November 16, 1960, John Sexton & Co issued 200,000 shares (26.76%) of the 747,437 shares outstanding at $16.50 per share in the over the counter market (NASDAQ) to become a public company. 33,000 of the shares represented new financing of the company for use as working capital. The 200,000 share offer were oversubscribed and closed at $16.50 per share. Hornblower & Weeks was the managing underwriter.[20] The financial structure of the company had evolved from its humble beginnings as a partnership formed in Chicago in 1883 to a public company with 747,437 shares outstanding with 72% held by family members and 26.76% held by the public.[20][21] The desire for John Sexton & Co. to go public was to gain better access to the commercial credit market. Sexton's management saw the opportunity to expand product lines and distribution networks, but its capital structure as a private company limited its borrowing capacity. As a public company, Sexton capital stock could be issued to purchase other grocery companies and fund expansion. In addition, the Sexton family held the majority of their wealth in the private John Sexton & Co. stock. Some family members wanted a publicly traded stock which could easily be sold at a true market price. The alternative was to try to sell their Sexton shares to another family member at a negotiated price. In 1961 John Sexton & Co. had over 1,400 employees, including 300 salesmen who were generating $49.5 million. 10 Sexton distribution warehouses were located in Atlanta; Chicago; Dallas; Detroit; Englewood, New Jersey; Indianapolis; Newton, Massachusetts; Pittsburgh; Philadelphia; and San Francisco. Sexton serviced over 50,000 customers located throughout the US, of which 40% were restaurants, 28% were schools and colleges, and 32% consisted of clubs, hospitals, convents and hotels. The Sexton catalogue included over 2,250 food and non-food items, of which 26% were manufactured in Sexton manufacturing facilities located in Indianapolis and Englewood. The rest of the Sexton products were manufactured by non-affiliated third parties. The Sexton delivery fleet consisted of 112 trucks and tractor-trailer combinations, of which 95 were owned by the company and the remainder leased. In certain areas of the country, Sexton utilized common carriers to deliver their products. Sexton was focused on meeting the rising demand from their customers as America began to embrace away-from-home eating as entertainment. To meet the increased demand, Sexton began modernizing its warehouses and manufacturing facilities.[22] As of June 30, 1961 John Sexton & Co. was generating $49.5 million in sales and the balance sheet had current assets of $15.4 million with liabilities of $4.9 million including $3.9 million of long term debt, $1.0 million of accounts payable and working capital of $10.5 million consisting of short term revolving credit lines. Book value was $16.57 per share. Dividends had consistently been paid since 1935 and in 1961 were paying $0.90 per share.[23] In July 1961, Franklin Sexton, secretary of the company, son of John Sexton, died at age 70. He had begun his career on State Street store in 1909 working for his father, John Sexton, as a Teamster making grocery deliveries in Chicago by horse and wagon. He oversaw the expansion of the country division, expansion of Sexton's national distribution network, the building of the Sexton plant on Illinois & Orleans and led the Sexton coffee and tea product lines. His career spanned over 50 years. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.[24] On October 4, 1961, John Sexton & Co. conducted a secondary offering of 70,000 share of stock at $23.50 per share at the request of the Ethel Sexton Marten Family and the Franklin Sexton Estate. The Marten family sold 49,924 of 50,924 shares and the Franklin Sexton Estate sold 20,076 of 57,436 shares. Hornblower & Weeks was the managing underwriter. The Marten family, led by sons John S. Marten and Harry Marten, left the company and purchased Fred's Frozen Foods, a food manufacturer located in Noblesville, Indiana.[25] Focus on growth[edit] In 1961, Sexton announced a major capital plan to add product lines, expand into new territories and modernize its distribution system. New warehouses were built or leased in Dallas, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Plans to roll out a computer-based inventory and accounting system were established.[26] In 1962, John Sexton & Co. and S.E. Rykoff & Co. of Los Angeles entered negotiation where Sexton Quality Foods would purchase Rykoff in a stock and debt assumption transaction. Rykoff had a very strong presence in the Los Angeles foodservice market that was attractive to Sexton Foods. Sexton Foods preferred to purchase a strong local market leader, rather than starting from scratch, since a new market could be penetrated much faster. Sexton Foods and S.E. Rykoff were not able to reach agreement.[27] After which, Sexton Quality Foods announced plans to open a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) warehouse and Sexton truck fleet in the Compton warehouse district of Los Angeles to support the southern California and Nevada Sexton sales force.[28] Also in 1962, the Long Island City Sexton warehouse building was sold and Sexton relocated to a modern distribution and manufacturing facility located at 360 Van Brunt St, Englewood, New Jersey[29] In 1964, Sexton purchased the institutional wholesale grocery department of National Brands Inc. located in Miami, Florida. A Sexton Warehouse was established in Miami that year. In 1965, Sexton purchased Cincinnati Foods, Inc., an institutional wholesaler located in Cincinnati, Ohio and a Sexton Warehouse was opened.[30] In 1965, Sexton began a capital investment in data processing to transition away from the traditional ledger inventory control and accounting. Using the IBM System/360 mainframe, Sexton designed a software system to automate inventory records, customer billing and accounts receivable. To insure a smooth transition, the automated accounting system was rolled out branch by branch during 1965. The data processing center was located in the general offices in Chicago.[30] In 1967, John Sexton & Co. operated 12 branch warehouses, which served over 79,000 customers throughout the continental United States, in the West Indies and Hawaii. Sexton branch warehouses were located in Atlanta, Boston (Newton, Massachusetts), Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York (Englewood, New Jersey), Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco. These branches and the 370 sales territories covered 500 of the major US metropolitan areas where 90% of all restaurants, schools, hospitals and foodservice customers were located. Approximately, 70% of all foodservice purchases were made through route salesmen or telephone orders. By 1967, 31% of foodservice customers purchased 76% of the food volume due to regional and national chains. The balance of the foodservice purchases was from small independent restaurants, schools, hospitals and foodservice providers. Sexton's quality products, national distribution network and sales force allowed it to provide the service that the varied customers demanded.[31] In 1967, nearly all 2,250 products distributed by Sexton were sold under its own trade names, brands and labels. Products included a broad line of canned foods, canned and processed meats, coffee, tea spice and paper products, everything except frozen foods, meat, milk and fresh produce. About 27 percent of the products distributed by Sexton were manufactured, processed, packed, bottled, or canned in Sexton manufacturing plants, the balance of the Sexton products were purchased from other food manufacturers. To insure high quality foods, Sexton had operated food laboratories since the 1890s for the systematic testing of "quality" in the products it produced, the products it distributed and for the development of new products. By July 1, 1967, Sexton had developed and placed on the market a number of new convenience products including "Jet Set", an instant gelatin, canned "Chopped Chicken Livers" and "Spoon-Redi", a line of puddings to be spooned directly from the can into dessert dishes. Although frozen and refrigerated food products were explored by Sexton, the majority of the foodservice customers in 1967 had yet to invest in cold storage in their kitchens.[31] Sale to Beatrice Foods[edit] In 1968, Mack Sexton was approached by Beatrice Foods with an offer to purchase the John Sexton & Co. Beatrice Foods was attracted to Sexton Quality Foods’ distribution network, quality, variety of private label products, specialized food offerings, sales force and profitability. Mack Sexton's initial response was no, but Beatrice Foods was very interested. Eventually both parties reached an agreement. Beatrice Foods increased the purchase, pledged capital to expand Sexton Quality Foods distribution network, pledged capital to introduce a new Sexton frozen product line and pledged that the Sexton leadership would continue to lead and operate the company as a separate entity. On December 20, 1968, Beatrice Foods acquired the business and assets of John Sexton & Co., exchanging approximately 375,000 shares of Beatrice's preferred convertible preference stock valued at $37,500,000. John Sexton & Co. would become a separate independent division of Beatrice Foods still led by Mack Sexton (son of Franklin), William Egan (son of Helen) and William Sexton (son of Sherman). Mack became a vice president of Beatrice and a Beatrice board member. John Sexton & Co. put Beatrice Foods into the wholesale grocery business and Beatrice put John Sexton & Co. into the frozen foods business.[32] Beatrice Foods and the Sexton leadership were interested in maximizing the investment in John Sexton & Co. by growing the company. In 1969, rather than proceeding with the original Sexton Quality Foods plan to acquire a frozen food manufacturer, Sexton tapped Beatrice Foods frozen foods expertise and capital to launch a Sexton frozen product line that included frozen meats, fruits, vegetables and ethnic entrees. Sexton Quality Foods new frozen line required the addition of industrial freezer storage to all 12-branch warehouses and retrofitting all delivery trucks with freezers. Over the next 4 years, six of the eight planned additional Sexton branch warehouses were opened in Hawaii, Indianapolis, Houston, Saint Louis, Seattle and Minneapolis. In January 1978, Thomas G. Sexton, son of the founder, retired president and chairman of the company died at the age of 88 at his home in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. Tom Sexton began work for his father in 1909 at the Lake & Franklin location. His first job was as a teamster delivering grocery in Chicago by horse and wagon. His career spanned 51 years until his retirement in 1959.[33] Beatrice Foods operated John Sexton & Co. as an independent division until 1983. Mack Sexton remained president of John Sexton & Co., a vice president of Beatrice and had a seat on the Beatrice board of directors until his retirement in 1981. A legal side note, Mack Sexton was the defendant in the first successful age discrimination case. Beatrice allegedly pressured Mack to improve business results. Mack decided to remove family members from the company. On January 24, 1977, Mack Sexton, president of the Sexton Division, called his cousin William C. Sexton (son of Sherman J. ) into his office and discharged him, indicating that more aggressive "younger blood" was required for management. William Sexton was 59 years old and a 41-year employee. Please see Sexton v. Beatrice Foods for more information. By the early 1980s Beatrice Foods was a $12 billion far-reaching multinational corporation with diverse holdings including Avis Rent A Car, Shedd's, Tropicana, Good & Plenty, Swift's Premium (including Butterball Turkey), Culligan, Rusty Jones, Samsonite Luggage and Playtex. Beatrice Foods had increasingly focused on divisions that yielded the larger profit margins than food, which typically yields consistent 2% to 3% profit margins. As a result, Beatrice Foods withheld capital investment into its food divisions. Sale to S.E. Rykoff & Co.[edit] After many years of buying companies, Beatrice Foods began the process of divesting. In 1983, Beatrice Foods announce that it was divesting 50 business of which, John Sexton & Co. was generating $380 million in sales which represented a 10% annual revenue growth since its purchase in 1967. The CEO of S.E. Rykoff & Co., Roger Coleman approached Beatrice with an offer to buy John Sexton & Co. Beatrice initially said no. In 1983, S.E. Rykoff & Co. ($346 million in sales) was a broad line grocer and restaurant equipment provider that operated in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. Rykoff had begun in 1911 as a family grocery store located near Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. In 1919, Saul Rykoff dropped his retail customers and focused exclusively on wholesale customers. In 1972 S.E. Rykoff & Co. went public and the shares were traded in the over the counter market (NASDAQ).[34][35] S.E. Rykoff & Co. CEO, Roger Coleman persuaded Beatrice Foods to sell John Sexton & Co. for $84 million. With the purchase of Sexton Quality Foods, Rykoff double in size, gained a national distribution network of 18 warehouses, a national sales force, recognized brand name, a loyal customer base, food manufacturing facilities, food laboratories, test kitchens, chemical manufacturing facilities, a coffee roasting plant and a spice blending operation. The Sexton Quality Foods west coast branches in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hawaii were absorbed into the Rykoff operations. Sexton Quality Foods branches in the south, Midwest, east and south continued to operate under the Sexton banner. In 1984, to reflect the importance of the Sexton Foods acquisition, S.E. Rykoff & Co. changed the company name to Rykoff-Sexton. However, Rykoff-Sexton continued to operate Sexton Quality Foods and Rykoff as two separate companies since merging the two companies was a complex task that involved customers, labor, systems, brands, products and corporate identity. Rykoff-Sexton and US Foodservice merge[edit] By the early 1990s, Rykoff-Sexton had successfully merged the two separate operating companies and was labeling the majority of the products under the Rykoff-Sexton banner. The result was better operating efficiencies, economies of scale and recognizable brand name. In 1995, Rykoff-Sexton relocated the headquarters from Los Angeles to Lisle, Illinois. Rykoff-Sexton was generating $1.6 billion in annual sales, which represented a 7% annual revenue growth rate since 1984. By the mid-1990s, the restaurant industry had further evolved into a chain system which demanded consistent, ready-to-assemble food products. Large national restaurant chains wanted to deal with one large national food distributor that could reliably provide products to their exact specifications. Rykoff-Sexton's management had decided that the best strategy was to strategically purchase other broad line grocers and grow revenue. During the mid-1990s, Rykoff-Sexton purchased Continental Foods of Baltimore for an undisclosed price and H&O Foods of Las Vegas for $5.5 million in cash and assumption of $26.6 million in debt. In February 1996, Rykoff-Sexton and US Foodservice of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania announced their intent to merge. The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. In 1996, US Foodservice was generating $1.5 billion in revenue and Rykoff-Sexton was generating $2 billion. The merger would combine the third and fourth largest U.S. broadline foodservice distributors with combined annual sales of approximately $3.5 billion.[36] The 8.8 million shares of US Foodservice were exchanged for $270 million in Rykoff-Sexton stock. The $350 million in US Foodservice debt was assumed by Rykoff-Sexton. Rykoff-Sexton (RYK) funded the purchase by issuing 14.3 million new shares at $25 per share.[37] In September 1996, the newly merged Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice announced that corporate headquarters would be relocated to Wilkes-Barre.[38] Merger with JP Foodservice[edit] In 1997, Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice was generating $3.2 billion in annual sales. The combined company was in the process of re-branding all products to the US Foodservice brand by dropping the Rykoff-Sexton, S.E. Rykoff & Co. and John Sexton & Co. brands. It was determined that a standardized and easily recognizable brand would better compete in the rapidly consolidating foodservice market. In addition, the US Foodservice brand would reflect a nationwide presence and distribution capabilities. During this time, the company headquarters were moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. In July 1997, JP Foodservice and Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice reached an agreement to merge the two companies. Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice shareholders would exchange their Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice stock for JP Foodservice stock. All outstanding Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice shares were exchanged for $680 million in JP Foodservice stock. The $700 million in Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice debt was assumed by the merged Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice-JP Foodservice balance sheet.[39] In 1997, JP Foodservice was generating about $2 billion in annual sales primarily focused on the east coast. Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice was generating $3.2 billion in annual sales from its national distribution network and its manufacturing divisions. After the merger, the combined Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice-JP Foodservice operating company generated $5 billion in annual sales in 1997.[40] US Foodservice[edit] In early 1998, the merged company Rykoff-Sexton-JP Foodservice changed its name to US Foodservice (USF) and dropped all Rykoff-Sexton-JP Foodservices brands and logos.[41] In addition, US Foodservice focused exclusively on sales, marketing and distribution. To help fund the merger, US Foodservice sold the Rykoff-Sexton Manufacturing Division (RSMD) to the private equity firm of Kohlberg & Company and RSMD senior management. RSMD manufactured over 1,400 food and non-food items and generated about $115 million in 1997. RSMD had manufacturing plants in Los Angeles (S.E. Rykoff & Co.), which manufactured non-food items such as detergents, cleaning compounds, refuse container liners, cutlery, straws and sandwich bags, paper napkins, placemats, chefs' hats, coasters, paper lace doilies and a line of low-temperature dishwashers. The plant in Englewood, New Jersey (Sexton Foods) manufactured coffee and spices. The 1800 Churchman Avenue plant in Indianapolis, Indiana (Sexton Quality Foods) manufactured more than 500 items including canned products, frozen products, refrigerated products, powdered products, shortenings/oils, dressings, sauces, syrups, flavorings, dry mixes, and soup bases. RSMD supplied Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice and also did some contract manufacturing for restaurant chains and other private label brands. The new company would operate under the name United Signature Foods L.L.C. Prior to the purchase, Kohlberg & Company required US Foodservice to enter into a six-year supply contract with U.S. Foods LLC that increased 6% over the term. Gross proceeds from the supply agreement and asset sale totaled $101 million.[42] Even with the sale of RSMD, some John Sexton & Co. signature products live on. For instance, US Foodservice still markets Alamo Zestful Seasonings, Jamaica Relish (developed by Sexton Food Chef Tony Bartolotta), Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing, and Kettle Rich soups. In 2000, US Foodservice was acquired by Dutch grocer Royal Ahold for $26 per share or $3.6 billion and the assumption of all outstanding US Foodservice debt. In 2006, Ahold stated that US Foodservice was generating $19.2 billion in sales. In 2007, Royal Ahold sold US Foodservice through a $7.2 billion leverage buyout conducted by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR had purchased Beatrice Foods, once the owner of Sexton, in 1986). As of June 2007, US Foodservice is jointly owned by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.[43] In 2009, US Foodservice was still privately held, and was the second largest broadline foodservice distributor in the U.S. with $18.97 billion in revenue and 24,687 employees. SYSCO was the largest foodservice distributor.[44] See also[edit] U.S. Foodservice S.E.

Andorra and Spain have an unusual and long relationship. Andorra was created by Charlemagne as a buffer state between France and the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.[1] In 1278, under terms of "pareage" agreement, Andorra adopted joint allegiance to a French and a Spanish prince after disputes between French heirs to the Urgel countship and the Spanish bishops of Urgell. For more than 700 years Andorra was ruled jointly by the leader of France and the Spanish Bishop of Urgell.[1] During the Spanish Civil War, Andorra received refugees from both sides of the Spanish conflict. During World War II, Andorra became an important smuggling route from Vichy France into neutral Spain.[1] Official diplomatic relations between Andorra and Spain were established after the signing of a joint Treaty of Good Neighborhood, Friendship and Cooperation between Andorra, France and Spain; after Andorra adopted a new constitution establishing them as a parliamentary democracy.[2] The Bishop of Urgell acts as a co-Prince (along with the President of France) in Andorra. In 1993, Spain opened a resident embassy in Andorra la Vella. In 2005, Andorra was admitted into the Organization of Ibero-American States and that year, Andorran Prime Minister Albert Pintat attended the Ibero-American Summit held in Salamanca, Spain. In January 2015, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy became the first Spanish leader to ever visit Andorra.[2] The visit was a clear example of the good state of bilateral relations. The progressive intensification of bilateral relations between Andorra and Spain progressed with the formal invitation, made in November 2016, by Andorran Present Antoni Martí for King Felipe VI of Spain to visit the Principality.[2] Spaniards are the largest nationality to visit Andorra for touristic purposes. Spanish citizens are also the largest foreign residents in Andorra with over 18,000 Spanish citizens living in Andorra.[3] Bilateral agreements[edit] Since 1993, both nations have signed several bilateral agreements such as a Treaty of Good Neighborhood, Friendship and Cooperation (1993); Agreement regarding the Statute of the Co-Prince Episcopal (1995); Agreement regarding the entry, circulation, residence and establishment of each nations citizens (2000); Agreement on Social Security (2002); Agreement on reciprocal recognition of hunting weapon authorizations and sports shooting (2005); Agreement in educational matters (2005); Agreement of Collaboration between the General Council of the Judiciary and the Superior Council of Justice (2006); Agreement for the exchange of information on tax matters (2010); Agreement on access to each nation's Universities (2010); Agreement on the transfer of waste (2011); Protocol of collaboration between the Spanish Attorney General of the State and the Andorran President of the Higher Council of Justice to establish a program of exchanges and visits by public prosecutors (2014); Agreement to avoid Double Taxation (2015); Agreement on International Road Transport (2015); Memorandum of understanding, friendship and general cooperation (2015); Agreement between the Spanish General Council of the Judiciary and the Andorran Superior Council of Justice (2015); Convention on combating crime and cooperation in security matters (2015); Memorandum of understanding between the AEMPS and the Ministry of Health of Andorra on Cooperation on medicines, health products and cosmetics (2017); Memorandum of understanding regarding the transfer of people diagnosed with high-risk infectious diseases for treatment in specialized medical centers in Spain (2017); Agreement on the exercise of paid professional activities by dependents of diplomatic, consular, administrative and technical personnel of diplomatic missions, consular offices and permanent representations before international organizations from one state to the other (2017) and a Memorandum of understanding in the field of cybersecurity (2017)[2] Trade[edit] In 2017, trade between Andorra and Spain totaled €835 million Euros.[2] Andorra's main exports to Spain include: tobacco and furniture. Spain exports to Andorra most of that nations basic food products and fuel. Spain is Andorra's largest trading partner. Several Spanish multinational companies operate in Andorra. A few Andorran banks operate in Spain.[3] Resident diplomatic missions[edit] Andorra has an embassy in Madrid.[4] Spain has an embassy in Andorra la Vella.[5] Embassy of Andorra in Madrid Embassy of Spain in Andorra la Vella See also[edit] Andorra–Spain border Andorra–European Union relations References[edit] ^ a b c BBC: Andorra ^ a b c d e Bilateral relations between Spain and Andorra (in Spanish) ^ a b Andorra en Xifres (in Spanish) ^ Embassy of Andorra in Madrid ^ Embassy of Spain in Andorra la Vella Bibliography[edit] Capdevila i Subirana, Joan (2009).

Education and public library[edit] The City of Quitman is served by the Quitman Independent School District, a UIL Class AAA school district. Recently, the school has produced a state championship in golf, UIL News Writing, Powerlifting, and received First Runner-Up at the 2011 State UIL One-Act Play contest. The Quitman Public Library is located at 202 East Goode Street one block east of the Wood County Courthouse. The library was formed in 1975 when a group of caring citizens gathered to study the need for a public library that would serve the City of Quitman and the surrounding community. The Quitman City Council chartered the library in 1975. The library's first building was in a frame house offered by the Liles family located at the corner of Main and Lane Streets near the courthouse square. In August 1980, a financial drive began to purchase a larger building to house the many books that had been collected from donations. The community supported the drive and the former facility of the First National Bank, at 202 East Goode Street, Quitman TX was purchased. In early 1987, a local fundraising effort was started for additional space in the library to accommodate a children's department, staff book processing area, and a community meeting room. The library received several grants, and in October 1988, the Thurman Shamburger Wing was dedicated. Today, the Quitman Public Library is fully staffed and houses a collection of nearly 30,000 items in a variety of formats; the library also houses the collection of the Wood County Genealogical Society. The library has an Advisory Board and active Friends of the Library group. The Mayor of Quitman and the Quitman City Council are the governing body of the Quitman Public Library as it is a department of the City of Quitman. The Quitman Public Library is in the heart of Quitman and Wood County.[12] Business[edit] Quitman serves as the home to many local businesses, most of which provide services to Wood County. BTH Bank, however, has spread its roots beyond county lines, and continues to grow throughout the East Texas area. Several locally owned restaurants provide a "mom and pop" service to the town. Quitman is also the home to several cooperative businesses. Wood County Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Peoples Telephone Cooperative, Inc are both located in Quitman. Community, arts and entertainment[edit] The Quitman Community Theatre, awarded by County Line Magazine as the Best Small Town Community Theatre in the Upper Eastside of Texas for five consecutive years, has provided the town with live productions since 2001. Each production takes place at the Carroll Green Civic Center, and on average, the theatre produces around three productions per year, including a musical. The 2017 Reaching Others Through Christ (ROTC) went to Quitman to build wheelchair ramps for some of the families living in Quitman and the surrounding cities.

The Chronicles trilogy came about because the designers wanted novels to tell the story of the game world they were creating, something to which TSR, Inc. (TSR) agreed only reluctantly.[2] Dragons of Autumn Twilight details the meeting of the Companions and the early days of The War of the Lance. The novel corresponds with the first two Dragonlance game modules, Dragons of Despair and Dragons of Flame, but with a different ending.[3] It introduces many of the characters that are the subject of later novels and short stories. The title Dragons of Autumn Twilight follows a pattern with the other novels in the series, Dragons of Winter Night and Dragons of Spring Dawning, as they all start with Dragons, followed the names of the seasons, Autumn, Winter, and Spring, as well as a series of time, Twilight, Night, and Dawning. Margaret Weis includes allusions to A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, one of her favorite stories. References include But there was something disquieting about him—secret, silent, self-contained, and solitary as an oyster[4] and The fate of mankind is my business. This quote is turned from meaning good to meaning harm.[5] Contents 1 Setting 2 Plot summary 3 Characters 3.1 Heroes of the Lance 3.2 Other major characters 4 Adaptations 4.1 Comic 4.2 Movie 5 Importance to Dragonlance 6 Reception 7 Reviews 8 See also 9 Release details 10 References 11 Sources 12 External links Setting[edit] The novels take place on the fantasy world of Krynn, created specifically for the gameplay. The world once worshiped the True Gods, a pantheon unique to the Dragonlance saga, but has come to believe that the True Gods have abandoned the world and those in it. The world is just starting to recover from the loss of the True Gods and a group has sprung up seeking to replace the True Gods (the Seekers). The main focus of the novels is the continent Ansalon and the characters Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Flint Fireforge, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, Goldmoon, and Riverwind. Plot summary[edit] The book begins with the return of a group of friends, consisting of Tanis, Sturm, Caramon, Raistlin, Flint, and Tasslehoff, who had separated to pursue their own quests and pledged to return in five years. Kitiara Uth Matar, the half sister of the twins Caramon and Raistlin, was supposed to be there as well, but only sent a mysterious note. On the eve of their reunion, the Companions discover that the village where they are meeting has been taken over by a religious order called the Seekers. They are collaborating with the Dragon Highlords, who are preparing for the conquest of the continent of Ansalon. The Companions soon discover that the Seekers are searching for a Blue Crystal Staff. When Goldmoon, a plainswoman in the same inn as the companions, heals a Seeker with her staff, the Companions are confronted by Highlord forces and are forced to flee the village. The next day, the group is attacked by Draconians, reptilian creatures that serve as foot soldiers in the Highlords' army. The Companions are driven into the woods, where they are attacked by undead and rescued by a centaur. The group is charged to go to the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth to retrieve the Disks of Mishakal, an object containing the teaching of the True Gods that will be instrumental for the restoration of the faith in the True Gods. 2000 paperback edition cover After a lengthy trip on the backs of pegasi and several encounters with the forces of darkness, the companions enter Xak Tsaroth and meet some gully dwarves, diminutive and socially awkward creatures. One of the dwarves, Bupu, leads them to the dragon Khisanth, who is killed by the holy power of the Blue Crystal Staff. When this happens, Goldmoon is consumed by its flame and presumed dead. However, they later find her resting at the foot of a statue of Mishakal (the Goddess of Healing), which now bears the Blue Crystal Staff, and Goldmoon is blessed with true clerical powers. The Companions leave with the Disks of Mishakal. Bupu gives an ancient spellbook (formerly belonging to the archmage Fistandantilus) to Raistlin. When they return to the village to regroup they find it occupied. The Companions are captured by the Highlord armies and are chained in a slave caravan along with an elf named Gilthanas, the son of the leader of the elven nation of Qualinesti. The group is freed by Gilthanas's brother, Porthios. They flee to Qualinesti, where Tanis is reunited with his childhood sweetheart, the exceptionally beautiful elven princess, Laurana Kanan. Laurana is still in love with Tanis and wants to marry him, but Tanis breaks her heart by telling her he is now in love with Kitiara. The Elven King Solostaran convinces the Companions to lead an attack on the slave-mine Pax Tharkas to free the slaves from the control of the local Dragon Highlord. The Companions journey through a secret passage underground to Pax Tharkas and devise a plan to free the slaves. Laurana, desperate to win Tanis back, secretly follows the Companions. When Tanis discovers Laurana has followed them he angrily rebukes her for acting like a spoiled child. Laurana resolves to try to prove she is more than that. The Companions infiltrate Pax Tharkas and Goldmoon heals Elistan, a dying Seeker, and converts him to the faith of the true gods. He becomes the first cleric of Paladine, and Goldmoon turns the Disks of Mishakal over to him. The Companions help the slaves break free. Laurana proves her worth in the battle by fighting bravely. The Dragon Highlord Verminaard and his red dragon Ember arrive to crush the revolt, but the insane red dragon Flamestrike kills Ember, while the Companions cut down Verminaard. A mysterious figure called "The Everman” later appears at a celebration following the freeing of the slaves, but flees after being spotted. According to Tracy Hickman, "The restoration of truth and faith are... to a great extent, the theme of this first book in the series."[6] Characters[edit] Heroes of the Lance[edit] Tanis Half-Elven, a half-elf and the leader of the companions, torn between the human woman Kitiara and the elfmaid Laurana.

A trade paperback collecting the issues was released in May 2006. It was ranked 33 in the top 100 graphic novels in sales with an estimated preorder quantity of 2,634.[7] Movie[edit] Main article: Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight A movie adaptation of the novel was released on 15 January 2008. It is the first direct-to-video movie release based on the Dragonlance campaign setting of Dungeons & Dragons. The screenplay adaptation was completed by George Strayton, with creative assistance by Weis and Hickman, and Will Meugniot directed. The movie used both 2D and 3D animation, and was made by Paramount Pictures.[8] Importance to Dragonlance[edit] The storyline of the original Dragonlance series had been plotted and outlined before either the novel trilogy or the games were written.[9] Dragons of Autumn Twilight was the first novel of the Dragonlance series. It was based upon a Dungeons & Dragons session played by the authors with some of their friends, some of whom later became Dragonlance writers. The novel was written after the completion of the first Dragonlance game modules. Weis and Hickman felt this was constraining and made the novel feel too episodic, so they reversed the process for the next books and completed the novels before the related modules were written.[10] This book sets up many of the most important characters, the group known as the Heroes of the Lance. According to the Dragonlance Nexus fansite, the Chronicles Trilogy sets the foundation for the rest of the novels.[11] A Wizards of the Coast interview stated that Hickman and Weis make a good team because Hickman is better at writing about good characters, and Weis is better at writing about dark characters, evidenced by her love of Raistlin.[12] Dragons of Autumn Twilight was the debut novel for both Weis and Hickman. Reception[edit] Dave Langford reviewed Dragons of Autumn Twilight for White Dwarf, suggesting that it was "inspired by an AD&D campaign full of chunks ripped bleeding from Tolkien" and complained about the "Deadly predictable questing, with stock D&D characters in familiar encounters" and ultimately reported that he "Couldn't finish this one."[13] Steve Hampshire reviewed Dragonlance Chronicles: Dragons of Autumn Twilight for Imagine magazine, and stated that "In conclusion, the book stands up well as AD&D supplementary material, but rather less well as a novel."[14] Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, stated a positive review of Dragonlance Chronicles, remarking that Dragons of Autumn Twilight is still widely read, although he noted the clichés of the series: "In Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the adventurers meet up in a tavern—even if it is a tavern that’s nestled in the branches of a giant tree, something my 12-year-old self thought was super cool. (My 42-year-old self agrees, although my days of getting drunk way up high up in a tree are starting to wind down.)".[15] Reviews[edit] Review by Michael M.

His research focuses in the philosophy of psychology. He also works in both the philosophy of mind, and philosophy of biology. Contents 1 Background 2 Publications 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Background[edit] Shapiro graduated summa cum laude from Dickinson College in 1984, earning entry into the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He received his Ph.D in philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. Shapiro married Athena Skaleris, a lawyer and together they moved to Madison, Wisconsin. They have two daughters, Sophia and Thalia. He has published a number of articles in top-tier philosophy journals. He is also the author of The Mind Incarnate (MIT:2004), which challenges the widespread assumption that mental states can be 'realized' in a variety of different substances. Shapiro's argument has important consequences for a range of philosophical positions about the mind, including the functionalist analysis of mental states. He has also co-edited, with Brie Gertler, Arguing About the Mind, a book of readings in the philosophy of mind. He published a book on embodied cognition called Embodied Cognition,[2] within which he lays out an in depth explanation of embodied cognition theories and their rivals. He has recently been awarded a Kellett Midcareer Award by the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

It lies between Zinnowitz and Koserow on the narrowest part of the island, between the Baltic Sea and the Achterwasser, a bay of the Oder Lagoon. Zempin lies on an isthmus on the island of Usedom. It is located within the Usedom Nature Park and is one of the four so-called Amber Spas on the island, connected by a 12 km long fine sandy beach called Amber Beach.[2] The other three amber spas are Loddin, Koserow and Ückeritz. As of 2015, Zempin had a population of 938. The place can be reached by federal highway B111 and has a station on the Usedom island railway. History[edit] The place was mentioned for the first time in 1571. It was described as a farmer and fishery village and stood at first under Pomeranian, then Swedish and Prussian sovereignty. A beach hotel was built in 1895, marking the beginning of Zempin as a seaside resort. In 1911, Zempin railway connection was established, joined the German bath federation in 1928 and in 1933 a sea-bridge was established. Between 1943 and 1945 in the forest area between Zinnowitz and Zempin three launching sites of V1 cruise missiles were built for experimental purposes. Still today some remains are present. In 1956 a camping site was created and since 1990, Zempin has been nationally recognized as a seaside resort.

He was once re-elected to the post, in 1960, but as early as the following year he was sidelined and replaced by Benyoucef Benkhedda, who held the presidency as Algeria was declared independent. The purpose of the GPRA was to serve as a diplomatic and political tool for the FLN. It allowed sympathetic governments to extend official recognition to it (among those that did were neighbouring Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Nasserite Egypt, other Arab countries, and Pakistan). Its headquarters were located in Tunis, but diplomats were posted in most major world capitals to try to lobby governments and organize local support groups. It was partly intended to serve as a preemptive diplomatic strike against a proposal by French President Charles de Gaulle to hold a referendum by which Algeria would be given an autonomous status within France.[2] Post-independence dissolution[edit] After the war, infighting broke out in FLN ranks. Benkhedda of the GPRA briefly held power in Algiers, but there was no unified power for the whole country. In late 1962, the GPRA was disbanded, after Ahmed Ben Bella seized power through forming a rival institution (a Political Bureau of the FLN) with the backing of the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN), controlled by Col. Houari Boumédiène. An attempt by GPRA politicians and loyal guerrilla units to resist the military-backed takeover was crushed in a short but intense burst of internal fighting. A compromise forced by Boumédiène saw most of the provisional government enter an expanded Political Bureau, and the GPRA itself was dissolved.[3] A one-party state under Ben Bella's command was then set up, after a constitution had been approved for the new republic.[4] While some[who?] argue that this broke the institutional continuity between the war-time GPRA and the present Algerian state, the Algerian presidency and government is still normally regarded as the GPRA's post-independence successor. List of members of the GPRA[edit] The GPRA was reformed twice, in 1960 and 1961, with the change of ministers and portfolios to some extent reflecting the shifts of power within the FLN. Below is a list of the three versions of the GPRA.[5] From left to right: Mohamed Khider, Mustafa Lacheraf, Hocine Aït Ahmed, Mohamed Boudiaf and Ahmed Ben Bella. The picture was taken after their arrest by France.

Once the home is ready, the individual has to find an auspicious time to conduct the puja, in consultation with an astrologer or Hindu priest. Graha Pravesh[2] is popular in three forms: "Apoorva", which is performed upon the first entry into a newly constructed home, "Sapoorva", which is done when an individual enters the home after arriving from a foreign land, and "Dwandwah", which is done when the individual enters the home after reconstruction or renovation, which might be due to fire, flood or earthquake. Among others, various Puja[3] recommended are the Vastu Puja and Vastu Shanti. After the Griha Pravesh is performed, one may enter their new house. Types[edit] Depending on the house types, there are various types griha pravesh methods used in ancient India. Main in these are apoorva, sapoorva and dwandhav grah pravesh[4] References[edit] ^ Dilipsinh, K.S. (2004). Kutch in Festival and Custom. Har-Anand Publications. p. 137. ISBN 978-81-241-0998-4.
